Caffeine
Definition
Caffeine is a drug that stimulates the central nervous
system.
Purpose
Caffeine makes people more alert, less drowsy, and
improves coordination. Combined with certain pain
relievers or medicines for treating migraine headache ,
caffeine makes those drugs work more quickly and effec-tively. Caffeine alone can also help relieve headaches.Antihistamines are sometimes combined with caffeine
to counteract the drowsiness that those drugs cause. Caf-feine is also sometimes used to treat other conditions,including breathing problems in newborns and in youngbabies after surgery.
Description
Caffeine is found naturally in coffee, tea, and chocolate."
"Description
Caffeine is found naturally in coffee, tea, and chocolate.
Colas and some other soft drinks contain it. Caffeine alsocomes in tablet and capsule forms and can be bought withouta prescription. Over-the-counter caffeine brands include NoDoz, Overtime, Pep-Back, Quick-Pep, Caffedrine, andVivarin. Some pain relievers, medicines for migraineheadaches, and antihistamines also contain caffeine.
Recommended dosage
Adults and children age 12 years and over
100–200 mg no more than every 3–4 hours. In
timed-release form, the dose is 200–250 mg once a day.Timed-release forms should not be taken less than sixhours before bedtime.
Children under 12 years
Not recommended.
Other considerations
Avoid taking too much caffeine when it is being
taken as an over-the-counter drug. Consider how muchcaffeine is being taken in from coffee, tea, chocolate, softdrinks, and other foods that contain caffeine. Check witha pharmacist or physician to find out how much caffeineis safe to use.
Precautions"
"Precautions
Caffeine cannot replace sleep and should not be used
regularly to stay awake as the drug can lead to more seri-ous sleep disorders , like insomnia .
People who use large amounts of caffeine over long
periods build up a tolerance to it. When that happens,they have to use more and more caffeine to get the sameeffects. Heavy caffeine use can also lead to dependence.If the person then stops using caffeine abruptly, with-drawal symptoms may occur. These can include throb-bing headaches, fatigue , drowsiness, yawning, irritabili-
ty, restlessness, vomiting, or runny nose. These symp-toms can go on for as long as a week if caffeine is avoid-ed. Then the symptoms usually disappear.
If taken too close to bedtime, caffeine can interfere
with sleep. Even if it does not prevent a person fromfalling asleep, it may disturb sleep during the night.
The notion that caffeine helps people sober up after"
"The notion that caffeine helps people sober up after
drinking too much alcohol is a myth. In fact, using caf-feine and alcohol together is not a good idea. The combi-nation can lead to an upset stomach, nausea, and vomiting.
Older people may be more sensitive to caffeine and
thus more likely to have certain side effects, such as irri-tability, nervousness, anxiety , and sleep problems.C

medical conditions or who are taking certain medicines.
ALLERGIES. Anyone with allergies to foods, dyes,
preservatives, or to the compounds aminophylline,dyphylline, oxtriphylline, theobromine, or theophyllineshould check with a physician before using caffeine.Anyone who has ever had an unusual reaction to caffeineshould also check with a physician before using it again.
PREGNANCY. Caffeine can pass from a pregnant
woman’s body into the developing fetus. Although thereis no evidence that caffeine causes birth defects in peo-
ple, it does cause such effects in laboratory animals givenvery large doses (equal to human doses of 12–24 cups ofcoffee a day). In humans, evidence exists that doses ofmore than 300 mg of caffeine a day (about the amount ofcaffeine in 2–3 cups of coffee) may cause miscarriage or
problems with the baby’s heart rhythm. Women who takemore than 300 mg of caffeine a day during pregnancy"
"are also more likely to have babies with low birthweights. Any woman who is pregnant or planning tobecome pregnant should check with her physician beforeusing caffeine.
BREASTFEEDING. Caffeine passes into breast milk
and can affect the nursing baby. Nursing babies whosemothers use 600 mg or more of caffeine a day may beirritable and have trouble sleeping. Women who arebreastfeeding should check with their physicians beforeusing caffeine.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Caffeine may cause
problems for people with these medical conditions:
• peptic ulcer• heart arrhythmias or palpitationsKEY TERMS
Arrhythmia —Abnormal heart rhythm.
Central nervous system —The brain, spinal cord
and nerves throughout the body.
Fetus —A developing baby inside the womb.
Palpitation —Rapid, forceful, throbbing, or flutter-
ing heartbeat.
Withdrawal symptoms —A group of physical or"
"ing heartbeat.
Withdrawal symptoms —A group of physical or
mental symptoms that may occur when a personsuddenly stops using a drug to which he or she hasbecome dependent.• heart disease or recent heart attack (within a few
weeks)
• high blood pressure• liver disease
• insomnia (trouble sleeping)
• anxiety or panic attacks• agoraphobia (fear of being in open places)• premenstrual syndrome (PMS)
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Using caffeine with
certain other drugs may interfere with the effects of thedrugs or cause unwanted—and possibly serious—sideeffects.
Side effects
At recommended doses, caffeine can cause restless-
ness, irritability, nervousness, shakiness, headache , light-"
"ness, irritability, nervousness, shakiness, headache , light-
headedness, sleeplessness, nausea, vomiting, and upsetstomach. At higher than recommended doses, caffeine cancause excitement, agitation, anxiety, confusion, a sensa-tion of light flashing before the eyes, unusual sensitivity totouch, unusual sensitivity of other senses, ringing in theears, frequent urination, muscle twitches or tremors , heart
arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, flushing, and convulsions.
Interactions
Certain drugs interfere with the breakdown of caf-
feine in the body. These include oral contraceptives that
contain estrogen, the antiarrhythmia drug mexiletine(Mexitil), the ulcer drug cimetidine (Tagamet), and thedrug disulfiram (Antabuse), used to treat alcoholism .
Caffeine interferes with drugs that regulate heart"
"Caffeine interferes with drugs that regulate heart
rhythm, such as quinidine and propranolol (Inderal). Caf-feine may also interfere with the body’s absorption of iron.Anyone who takes iron supplements should take them atleast an hour before or two hours after using caffeine.
Serious side effects are possible when caffeine is
combined with certain drugs. For example, taking caf-feine with the decongestant phenylpropanolamine canraise blood pressure. And very serious heart problemsmay occur if caffeine and monoamine oxidase
inhibitors (MAO) are taken together. These drugs are
used to treat Parkinson’s disease , depression, and other
psychiatric conditions. Consult with a pharmacist orphysician about which drugs can interact with caffeine.
Because caffeine stimulates the nervous system,
anyone taking other central nervous system (CNS) stim-ulants should be careful about using caffeine.

Calcium channel blockers
Definition
Calcium channel blockers are medicines that slow
the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart andblood vessels. This, in turn, relaxes blood vessels,increases the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart,and reduces the heart’s workload.
Purpose
Calcium channel blockers are used to treat high
blood pressure, to correct abnormal heart rhythms, and torelieve the type of chest pain called angina pectoris.
Physicians also prescribe calcium channel blockers totreat panic attacks and bipolar disorder (manic depres-
sive illness) and to prevent migraine headache .
Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking calcium"
"Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking calcium
channel blockers is important. The physician will checkto make certain the medicine is working as it should andwill watch for unwanted side effects. People who havehigh blood pressure often feel perfectly fine. However,they should continue to see their prescribing physicianeven when they feel well so that he can keep a closewatch on their condition. They should also continue totake their medicine even when they feel fine.
Calcium channel blockers will not cure high blood"
"Calcium channel blockers will not cure high blood
pressure, but will help to control the condition. To avoidthe serious health problems associated with high bloodpressure, patients may have to take this type of medica-tion for the rest of their lives. Furthermore, the blockersalone may not be enough. People with high blood pres-sure may also need to avoid certain foods and keep theirweight under control. The health care professional whois treating the condition can offer advice as to what mea-sures may be necessary. Patients being treated for highblood pressure should not change their diets without
consulting their physicians.Anyone taking calcium channel blockers for high
blood pressure should not take any other prescription orover-the-counter medication without first checking withthe prescribing physician, as some of these drugs mayincrease blood pressure.
Some people feel drowsy or less alert than usual"
"Some people feel drowsy or less alert than usual
when taking calcium channel blockers. Anyone whotakes these drugs should not drive, use machines, or doanything else that might be dangerous until they havefound out how the drugs affect them.
People who normally have chest pain when they
exercise or exert themselves may not have the pain when
they are taking calcium channel blockers. This could leadthem to be more active than they should be. Anyone tak-ing calcium channel blockers should therefore consultwith the prescribing physician concerning how muchexercise and activity may be considered safe.
Some people get headaches that last for a short time
after taking a dose of this medication. This problem usu-ally goes away during the course of treatment. If it doesnot, or if the headaches are severe, the prescribing physi-cian should be informed.
Patients taking certain calcium channel blockers"
"Patients taking certain calcium channel blockers
may need to check their pulse regularly, as the drugs mayslow the pulse too much. If the pulse is too slow, circula-tion problems may result. The prescribing physician canshow patients the correct way to check their pulse.
This type of medication may cause the gums to
swell, bleed, or become tender. If this problem occurs, amedical physician or dentist should be consulted. To helpprevent the problem, care should be taken when brushingand flossing the teeth. Regular dental check-ups andcleanings are also recommended.
Older people may be unusually sensitive to the
effects of calcium channel blockers. This may increasethe chance of side effects.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines may develop problems ifthey also take calcium channel blockers. Before takingthese drugs, the prescribing physician should beinformed about any of these conditions:"
"ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had a previous unusual
reaction to any calcium channel blocker should let his orher physician know before taking the drugs again. Thephysician should also be notified about any allergies to
foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY. The effects of taking calcium channel
blockers during pregnancy have not been studied in

doses of these drugs have been reported to cause birth
defects ,stillbirth , poor bone growth, and other problems
when taken during pregnancy. Women who are pregnantor who may become pregnant should check with theirphysicians before using these drugs.
BREASTFEEDING. Some calcium channel blockers
pass into breast milk, but there have been no reports ofproblems in nursing babies whose mothers were takingthis type of medication. However, women who need totake this medicine and want to breastfeed their babiesshould check with their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Calcium channel

Description
Calcium channel blockers are available only with a
physician’s prescription and are sold in tablet, capsule,and injectable forms. Some commonly used calciumchannel blockers include amlopidine (Norvasc), dilti-azem (Cardizem), isradipine (DynaCirc), nifedipine(Adalat, Procardia), nicardipine (Cardene), and vera-pamil (Calan, Isoptin, Verelan).

This medicine should not be discontinued without
checking with the prescribing physician. Some condi-tions may worsen when patients stop taking calciumchannel blockers abruptly. The prescribing physician willadvise as to how to gradually taper down before stoppingthe medication completely.

Normal results
The expected result of taking a calcium channel
blocker is to either correct abnormal heart rhythms,return blood pressure to normal, or relieve chest pain.Resources

Definition
Campylobacteriosis refers to infection by the group
of bacteria known as Campylobacter . The term comes
from the Greek word meaning “curved rod” referring tothe bacteria’s curved shape. The most common diseasecaused by these organisms is diarrhea , which most often
affects children and younger adults. Campylobacter
infections account for a substantial percent of food-borneillness encountered each year.

species such as C. fetus produce disease outside the intes-
tine, particularly in those with altered immune systems,such as people with AIDS ,cancer , and liver disease.
Campylobacter are often found in the intestine of
animals raised for food produce and pets. Infected ani-mals often have no symptoms. Chickens are the mostcommon source of human infection. It is estimated that1% of the general population is infected each year.
Causes and symptoms
Improper or incomplete food preparation is the most
common way the disease is spread, with poultry account-ing for over half the cases. Untreated water and raw milkare also potential sources.

Complications
Dehydration is the most common complication.

"• Joint inflammation can occur weeks later (leading to an
unusual form of arthritis).
• Infection of vessels and heart valves is a special charac-
teristic of C. fetus . Immunocompromised patients may
develop repeated episodes of passage of bacteria intothe bloodstream from these sites of infection.
• The gallbladder, pancreas, and bone may be affected.
Diagnosis
Campylobacter is only one of many causes of acute
diarrhea. Culture (growing the bacteria in the laboratory)of freshly obtained diarrhea fluid is the only way to becertain of the diagnosis.
Treatment
The first aim of treatment is to keep up nutrition
and avoid dehydration. Medications used to treat diar-rhea by decreasing intestinal motility, such as Lop-eramide or Diphenoxylate are also useful, but shouldonly be used with the advice of a physician. Antibiotics"
"are of value, if started within three days of onset ofsymptoms. They are indicated for those with severe orpersistent symptoms. Either an erythromycin type drugor one of the fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin)
for five to seven days are the accepted therapies.
Prognosis
Most patients with Campylobacter infection rapidly
recover without treatment. For certain groups of patients,infection becomes chronic and requires repeated coursesof antibiotics.
Prevention
Good hand washing technique as well as proper
preparation and cooking of food is the best way to pre-vent infection.

Cancer
Definition
Cancer is not just one disease, but a large group of
almost one hundred diseases. Its two main characteristicsare uncontrolled growth of the cells in the human bodyand the ability of these cells to migrate from the originalsite and spread to distant sites. If the spread is not con-trolled, cancer can result in death .
Description
One out of every four deaths in the United States is
from cancer. It is second only to heart disease as a causeof death in the states. About 1.2 million Americans arediagnosed with cancer annually; more than 500,000 dieof cancer annually.

"Cancer can attack anyone. Since the occurrence of
cancer increases as individuals age, most of the cases areseen in adults, middle-aged or older. Sixty percent of allcancers are diagnosed in people who are older than 65years of age. The most common cancers are skin cancer,lung cancer, colon cancer ,breast cancer (in women),
and prostate cancer (in men). In addition, cancer of the
kidneys, ovaries, uterus, pancreas, bladder, rectum, andblood and lymph node cancer (leukemias and lym-phomas) are also included among the 12 major cancersthat affect most Americans.

"Cancer, by definition, is a disease of the genes. A
gene is a small part of DNA, which is the master mole-cule of the cell. Genes make “proteins,” which are theultimate workhorses of the cells. It is these proteins thatallow our bodies to carry out all the many processes thatpermit us to breathe, think, move, etc.
Throughout people’s lives, the cells in their bodies
are growing, dividing, and replacing themselves. Manygenes produce proteins that are involved in controllingthe processes of cell growth and division. An alteration(mutation) to the DNA molecule can disrupt the genesand produce faulty proteins. This causes the cell tobecome abnormal and lose its restraints on growth. Theabnormal cell begins to divide uncontrollably and even-tually forms a new growth known as a “tumor” or neo-plasm (medical term for cancer meaning “new growth”).
In a healthy individual, the immune system can rec-"
"In a healthy individual, the immune system can rec-
ognize the neoplastic cells and destroy them before theyget a chance to divide. However, some mutant cells mayescape immune detection and survive to become tumorsor cancers.
Tumors are of two types, benign or malignant. A
benign tumor is not considered cancer. It is slow growing,does not spread or invade surrounding tissue, and once itis removed, it doesn’t usually recur. A malignant tumor,on the other hand, is cancer. It invades surrounding tissueand spreads to other parts of the body. If the cancer cellshave spread to the surrounding tissues, then, even afterthe malignant tumor is removed, it generally recurs.
A majority of cancers are caused by changes in the
cell’s DNA because of damage due to the environment.Environmental factors that are responsible for causingthe initial mutation in the DNA are called carcinogens,and there are many types.

"There are some cancers that have a genetic basis. In
other words, an individual could inherit faulty DNA fromhis parents, which could predispose him to getting cancer.While there is scientific evidence that both factors (envi-ronmental and genetic) play a role, less than 10% of allcancers are purely hereditary. Cancers that are known tohave a hereditary link are breast cancer, colon cancer,ovarian cancer , and uterine cancer. Besides genes, cer-
tain physiological traits could be inherited and could con-tribute to cancers. For example, inheriting fair skin makesa person more likely to develop skin cancer, but only ifthey also have prolonged exposure to intensive sunlight.
There are several different types of cancers:
• Carcinomas are cancers that arise in the epithelium (the"
"• Carcinomas are cancers that arise in the epithelium (the
layers of cells covering the body’s surface and lining theinternal organs and various glands). Ninety percent ofhuman cancers fall into this category. Carcinomas can besubdivided into two types: adenocarcinomas and squa-
mous cell carcinomas. Adenocarcinomas are cancers thatdevelop in an organ or a gland, while squamous cell car-cinomas refer to cancers that originate in the skin.
• Melanomas also originate in the skin, usually in the
pigment cells (melanocytes).
• Sarcomas are cancers of the supporting tissues of the
body, such as bone, muscle and blood vessels.
• Cancers of the blood and lymph glands are called
leukemias and lymphomas respectively.
• Gliomas are cancers of the nerve tissue.
Causes and symptoms
The major risk factors for cancer are: tobacco, alco-
hol, diet, sexual and reproductive behavior, infectiousagents, family history, occupation, environment and pol-lution."
"According to the estimates of the American Cancer
Society (ACS), approximately 40% of the cancer deathsin 1998 will be due to tobacco and excessive alcohol use.An additional one-third of the deaths will be related todiet and nutrition . Many of the one million skin cancers
that are expected to be diagnosed in 1998 will be due toover-exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun’s rays.
Tobacco
Eighty to ninety percent of the lung cancer cases
occur in smokers. Smoking has also been shown to be a
contributory factor in cancers of upper respiratory tract,esophagus, larynx, bladder, pancreas, and probably liver,stomach, and kidney as well. Recently, scientists havealso shown that second-hand smoke (or passive smoking)can increase one’s risk of developing cancer.

"certain cancers, such as liver cancer . Alcohol, in combi-
nation with tobacco, significantly increases the chancesthat an individual will develop mouth, pharynx, larynxand esophageal cancers.
Diet
Thirty-five percent of all cancers are due to dietary
causes. Excessive intake of fat leading to obesity has
been associated with cancers of the breast, colon, rectum,pancreas, prostate, gall bladder, ovaries and uterus.
Sexual and reproductive behavior
The human papilloma virus, which is sexually trans-
mitted, has been shown to cause cancer of the cervix.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 632CancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 632"
"Having too many sex partners and becoming sexually
active early has been shown to increase one’s chances ofcontracting this disease. In addition, it has also beenshown that women who don’t have children or have chil-dren late in life have an increased risk for both ovarianand breast cancer.
Infectious agents
In the last 20 years, scientists have obtained evidence
to show that approximately 15% of the world’s cancerdeaths can be traced to viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Themost common cancer-causing pathogens and the cancersassociated with them are shown in table form.
Family history
Certain cancers like breast, colon, ovarian and uter-
ine cancer recur generation after generation in some fami-lies. A few cancers, such as the eye cancer “retinoblas-"
"toma,” a type of colon cancer, and a type of breast cancerknown as “early-onset breast cancer,” have been shown tobe linked to certain genes that can be tracked within afamily. It is therefore possible that inheriting particulargenes makes a person susceptible to certain cancers.
Occupational hazards
There is evidence to prove that certain occupational
hazards account for 4% of all cancer deaths. For exam-ple, asbestos workers have an increased incidence oflung cancer. Similarly, a higher likelihood of gettingbladder cancer is associated with dye, rubber and gas
workers; skin and lung cancer with smelters, gold minersand arsenic workers; leukemia with glue and varnishworkers; liver cancer with PVC manufacturers; and lung,bone and bone marrow cancer with radiologists and ura-nium miners.

"Environment
Radiation is believed to cause 1–2% of all cancer
deaths. Ultra-violet radiation from the sun accounts for amajority of melanoma deaths. Other sources of radiationare x rays, radon gas, and ionizing radiation from nuclearmaterial.
Pollution
Several studies have shown that there is a well-
established link between asbestos and cancer. Chlorina-tion of water may account for a small rise in cancer risk.However, the main danger from pollution occurs whendangerous chemicals from the industries escape into thesurrounding environment. It has been estimated that 1%of cancer deaths are due to air, land and water pollution.Cancer is a progressive disease, and goes through sev-
eral stages. Each stage may produce a number of symp-toms. Some symptoms are produced early and may occurdue to a tumor that is growing within an organ or a gland.As the tumor grows, it may press on the nearby nerves,organs and blood vessels. This causes pain and some pres-"
"sure which may be the earliest warning signs of cancer.
Despite the fact that there are several hundred differ-
ent types of cancers, producing very different symptoms,the ACS has established the following seven symptomsas possible warning signals of cancer:
• changes in the size, color, or shape of a wart or a mole
• a sore that does not heal• persistent cough , hoarseness, or sore throat
• a lump or thickening in the breast or elsewhere• unusual bleeding or discharge
• chronic indigestion or difficulty in swallowing
• any change in bowel or bladder habits
Many other diseases, besides cancer, could produce
the same symptoms. However, it is important to havethese symptoms checked, as soon as possible, especiallyif they linger. The earlier a cancer is diagnosed and treat-ed, the better the chance of it being cured. Many cancerssuch as breast cancer may not have any early symptoms.Therefore, it is important to undergo routine screeningtests such as breast self-exams and mammograms."
"Diagnosis
Diagnosis begins with a thorough physical examina-
tion and a complete medical history. The doctor will
observe, feel and palpate (apply pressure by touch) differ-ent parts of the body in order to identify any variationsfrom the normal size, feel and texture of the organ or tissue.

"As part of the physical exam, the doctor will inspect
the oral cavity or the mouth. By focusing a light into themouth, he will look for abnormalities in color, moisture,surface texture, or presence of any thickening or sore in thelips, tongue, gums, the hard palate on the roof of the mouth,and the throat. To detect thyroid cancer , the doctor will
observe the front of the neck for swelling. He may gentlymanipulate the neck and palpate the front and side surfacesof the thyroid gland (located at the base of the neck) todetect any nodules or tenderness. As part of the physicalexamination, the doctor will also palpate the lymph nodesin the neck, under the arms and in the groin. Many illnessesand cancers cause a swelling of the lymph nodes.
The doctor may conduct a thorough examination of
the skin to look for sores that have been present for morethan three weeks and that bleed, ooze, or crust; irritatedpatches that may itch or hurt, and any change in the sizeof a wart or a mole."
"Examination of the female pelvis is used to detect
cancers of the ovaries, uterus, cervix, and vagina. In thevisual examination, the doctor looks for abnormal dis-charges or the presence of sores. Then, using glovedhands the physician palpates the internal pelvic organssuch as the uterus and ovaries to detect any abnormalmasses. Breast examination includes visual observationwhere the doctor looks for any discharge, unevenness,discoloration, or scaling. The doctor palpates bothbreasts to feel for masses or lumps.
For males, inspection of the rectum and the prostate
is also included in the physical examination. The doctorinserts a gloved finger into the rectum and rotates it slow-ly to feel for any growths, tumors, or other abnormalities.The doctor also conducts an examination of the testes,where the doctor observes the genital area and looks forswelling or other abnormalities. The testicles are palpat-ed to identify any lumps, thickening or differences in thesize, weight and firmness."
"If the doctor detects an abnormality on physical exam-
ination, or the patient has some symptom that could beindicative of cancer, the doctor may order diagnostic tests.
Laboratory studies of sputum (sputum cytology),
blood, urine, and stool can detect abnormalities that mayindicate cancer. Sputum cytology is a test where thephlegm that is coughed up from the lungs is microscopi-cally examined. It is often used to detect lung cancer. Ablood test for cancer is easy to perform, usually inexpen-sive and risk-free. The blood sample is obtained by a labtechnician or a doctor by inserting a needle into a veinand is relatively painless. Blood tests can be either spe-cific or non-specific. Often times, in certain cancers, thecancer cells release particular proteins (called tumor
markers ) and blood tests can be used to detect the pres-ence of these tumor markers. However, with a few excep-"
"tions, tumor markers are not used for routine screeningof cancers, because several non-cancerous conditionsalso produce positive results. Blood tests are generallymore useful in monitoring the effectiveness of the treat-ment, or in following the course of the disease anddetecting recurrent disease.
Imaging tests such as computed tomography scans
(CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultra-
sound and fiberoptic scope examinations help the doctorsdetermine the location of the tumor even if it is deepwithin the body. Conventional x rays are often used forinitial evaluation, because they are relatively cheap, pain-less and easily accessible. In order to increase the infor-mation obtained from a conventional x ray, air or a dye(such as barium or iodine) may be used as a contrastmedium to outline or highlight parts of the body.
The most definitive diagnostic test is the biopsy,"
"The most definitive diagnostic test is the biopsy,
wherein a piece of tissue is surgically removed for micro-scope examination. Besides confirming a cancer, thebiopsy also provides information about the type of can-cer, the stage it has reached, the aggressiveness of thecancer and the extent of its spread. Since a biopsy pro-vides the most accurate analysis, it is considered the goldstandard of diagnostic tests.
Screening examinations conducted regularly by
healthcare professionals can result in the detection of can-cers of the breast, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate, testis,tongue, mouth, and skin at early stages, when treatment ismore likely to be successful. Some of the routine screen-ing tests recommended by the ACS are sigmoidoscopy
(for colorectal cancer), mammography (for breast can-
cer), pap smear (for cervical cancer ), and the PSA test"
"cer), pap smear (for cervical cancer ), and the PSA test
(for prostate cancer). Self-examinations for cancers of thebreast, testes, mouth, and skin can also help in detectingthe tumors before the symptoms become serious.
A recent revolution in molecular biology and cancer
genetics has contributed a great deal to the developmentof several tests designed to assess one’s risk of gettingcancers. These new techniques include genetic testing ,
where molecular probes are used to identify mutations incertain genes that have been linked to particular cancers.At present, however, there are a lot of limitations to genet-ic testing and its utility appears ambiguous, emphasizingthe need to develop better strategies for early detection.
Treatment

much of the tumor as possible and to prevent the recur-rence or spread of the primary tumor. While devising atreatment plan for cancer, the likelihood of curing the"
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 634CancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 634
"cancer has to be weighed against the side effects of the
treatment. If the cancer is very aggressive and a cure isnot possible, then the treatment should be aimed atrelieving the symptoms and controlling the cancer for aslong as possible.
Cancer treatment can take many different forms, and
it is always tailored to the individual patient. The deci-sion on which type of treatment is the most appropriatedepends on the type and location of cancer, the extent towhich it has already spread, the patient’s age, sex, gener-al health status and personal treatment preferences. Themajor types of treatment are: surgery, radiation, chemo-
therapy , immunotherapy, hormone therapy, and bone-
marrow transplantation.
Surgery
Surgery is the removal of a visible tumor and is the
most frequently used cancer treatment. It is most effec-tive when a cancer is small and confined to one area ofthe body.

"Surgery can be used for many purposes.
• Treatment. Treatment of cancer by surgery involves
removal of the tumor to cure the disease. This is typical-ly done when the cancer is localized to a discrete area.Along with the cancer, some part of the normal sur-rounding tissue is also removed to ensure that no cancercells remain in the area. Since cancer usually spreadsvia the lymphatic system, adjoining lymph nodes maybe examined and sometimes they are removed as well.
• Preventive surgery. Preventive or prophylactic surgery
involves removal of an abnormal looking area that islikely to become malignant over time. For example,40% of the people with a colon disease known as ulcer-
ative colitis , ultimately die of colon cancer. Rather than
live with the fear of developing colon cancer, these peo-ple may choose to have their colons removed andreduce the risk significantly.• Diagnostic purposes. The most definitive tool for diag-"
"nosing cancer is a biopsy. Sometimes, a biopsy can beperformed by inserting a needle through the skin. How-ever, at other times, the only way to obtain some tissuesample for biopsy is by performing a surgical operation.
• Cytoreductive surgery is a procedure where the doctor
removes as much of the cancer as possible, and thentreats the remaining with radiation therapy or chemo-
therapy or both.
• Palliative surgery is aimed at curing the symptoms, not"
"therapy or both.
• Palliative surgery is aimed at curing the symptoms, not
the cancer. Usually, in such cases, the tumor is so large orhas spread so much that removing the entire tumor is notan option. For example, a tumor in the abdomen may beso large that it may press on and block a portion of theintestine, interfering with digestion and causing pain andvomiting. “Debulking surgery” may remove a part of theblockage and relieve the symptoms. In tumors that aredependent on hormones, removal of the organs thatsecrete the hormones is an option. For example, inprostate cancer, the release of testosterone by the testi-cles stimulates the growth of cancerous cells. Hence, aman may undergo an “orchiectomy” (removal of testi-cles) to slow the progress of the disease. Similarly, in atype of aggressive breast cancer, removal of the ovaries(oophorectomy ) will stop the synthesis of hormones
from the ovaries and slow the progression of the cancer.
Radiation"

Radiation
Radiation kills tumor cells. Radiation is used alone
in cases where a tumor is unsuitable for surgery. Moreoften, it is used in conjunction with surgery andchemotherapy. Radiation can be either external or inter-nal. In the external form, the radiation is aimed at thetumor from outside the body. In internal radiation (alsoknown as brachytherapy), a radioactive substance in theform of pellets or liquid is placed at the cancerous siteby means of a pill, injection or insertion in a sealed con-tainer.

Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells.
It destroys the hard-to-detect cancer cells that havespread and are circulating in the body. Chemotherapeuticdrugs can be taken either orally (by mouth) or intra-venously, and may be given alone or in conjunction withsurgery, radiation or both.

"When chemotherapy is used before surgery or radia-
tion, it is known as primary chemotherapy or “neoadju-vant chemotherapy.” An advantage of neoadjuvantchemotherapy is that since the cancer cells have not beenexposed to anti-cancer drugs, they are especially vulnera-ble. It can therefore be used effectively to reduce the sizeof the tumor for surgery or target it for radiation. Howev-er, the toxic effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy aresevere. In addition, it may make the body less tolerant tothe side effects of other treatments that follow such asradiation therapy. The more common use of chemothera-py is adjuvant therapy, which is given to enhance theeffectiveness of other treatments For example, aftersurgery, adjuvant chemotherapy is given to destroy anycancerous cells that still remain in the body.

Unlike traditional vaccines, cancer vaccines donot prevent cancer. Instead, they are designed to treatpeople who already have the disease. Cancer vaccineswork by boosting the body’s immune system and trainingthe immune cells to specifically destroy cancer cells.

"Hormone therapy
Hormone therapy is standard treatment for some
types of cancers that are hormone-dependent and growfaster in the presence of particular hormones. Theseinclude cancer of the prostate, breast, and uterus. Hor-mone therapy involves blocking the production or actionof these hormones. As a result the growth of the tumorslows down and survival may be extended for severalmonths or years.
Bone marrow transplantation
The bone marrow is the tissue within the bone cavi-
ties that contains blood-forming cells. Healthy bonemarrow tissue constantly replenishes the blood supplyand is essential to life. Sometimes, the amount of drugs"
"or radiation needed to destroy cancer cells also destroysbone marrow. Replacing the bone marrow with healthycells counteracts this adverse effect. A bone marrowtransplant is the removal of marrow from one person andthe transplant of the blood-forming cells either to thesame person or to someone else. Bone-marrow trans-plantation, while not a therapy in itself, is often used to“rescue” a patient, by allowing those with cancer toundergo very aggressive therapy.
Many different specialists generally work together
as a team to treat cancer patients. An oncologist is aphysician who specializes in cancer care. The oncologistprovides chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and any othernon-surgical treatment that does not involve radiation.The oncologist often serves as the primary physician andcoordinates the patient’s treatment plan.
The radiation oncologist specializes in using radia-"
"tion to treat cancer, while the surgical oncologist performsthe operations needed to diagnose or treat cancer. Gyne-cologist-oncologists and pediatric-oncologists, as theirtitles suggest, are physicians involved with treatingwomen’s and children’s cancers respectively. Many otherspecialists may also be involved in the care of a cancerpatient. For example, radiologists specialize in the use ofx rays, ultrasounds, computed tomography scans (CTscans), MRI imaging and other techniques that are used todiagnose cancer. Hematologists specialize in disorders ofthe blood and are consulted in case of blood cancers andbone marrow cancers. The samples that are removed forbiopsy are sent to a laboratory, where a pathologist exam-ines them to determine the type of cancer and extent ofthe disease. Only some of the specialists who are involvedwith cancer care have been mentioned above.

"Alternative treatment
There are a multitude of alternative treatments avail-
able to help the person with cancer. They can be used inconjunction with, or separate from, surgery, chemothera-py, and radiation therapy. Alternative treatment of canceris a complicated arena and a trained health practitionershould be consulted.
Although the effectiveness of complementary thera-
pies such as acupuncture in alleviating cancer pain has

of the side effects of radiation and chemotherapy and arebeing recommended by many doctors.
Certain foods including many vegetables, fruits and
grains are believed to offer protection against variouscancers. However, isolation of the individual constituentof vegetables and fruits that are anti-cancer agents hasproven difficult. In laboratory studies, vitamins such as
A, C and E, as well as compounds such as isothio-cyanates and dithiolthiones found in broccoli, cauli-flower, and cabbage, and beta-carotene found in carrotshave been shown to protect against cancer.

Similarly, retinoids derived from vitaminA are being tested for their ability to slow the progressionor prevent head and neck cancers. Certain studies havesuggested that cancer incidence is lower in areas wheresoil and foods are rich in the mineral selenium. More tri-als are needed to explain these intriguing connections.

"Prognosis
“Lifetime risk” is the term that cancer researchers
use to refer to the probability that an individual over thecourse of a lifetime will develop cancer or die from it. Inthe United States, men have a one in two lifetime risk ofdeveloping cancer, and for women the risk is one inthree. Overall, African-Americans are more likely todevelop cancer than whites. African-Americans are also30% more likely to die of cancer than whites.
Most cancers are curable if detected and treated at
their early stages. A cancer patient’s prognosis is affectedby many factors, particularly the type of cancer thepatient has, the stage of the cancer, the extent to which ithas metastasized and the aggressiveness of the cancer. Inaddition, the patient’s age, general health status and theeffectiveness of the treatment being pursued are alsoimportant factors.

disease and the likelihood of recovery from the disease,doctors often use statistics. The five-year survival ratesare the most common measures used. The number refersto the proportion of people with cancer who are expectedto be alive, five years after initial diagnosis, comparedwith a similar population that is free of cancer. It is
important to note that while statistics can give someinformation about the average survival experience ofcancer patients in a given population, it cannot be used toindicate individual prognosis, because no two patientsare exactly alike.
Prevention

Cancer therapy, definitive
Definition
Definitive cancer therapy is a treatment plan
designed to potentially cure cancer using one or a combi-nation of interventions including surgery, radiation,chemical agents, or biological therapies.
Purpose
The primary purpose of definitive care is to establish
a cure and to destruct and remove all cancer cells fromthe infected person.
Surgery is not only a diagnostic tool, but also used
for tumor removal . The surgeon usually identifies poten-
tial candidates for tumor removal and repairs intraopera-tively (during the operation procedure). Surgery can becurative for some stomach, genital/urinary, thyroid,breast, skin, and central nervous system cancers. The bestchance for a surgical cure is usually with the first opera-

"tion. It is essential that the cancer surgeon (oncologic sur-
geon) be experienced in the specific procedure.
Radiation therapy is commonly administered to
approximately 50% of cancer patients during the course ofillness. It can be used as the sole method of cure for tumorsin the mouth and neighboring structures in the oral cavity,vagina, prostate, cervix, esophagus, Hodgkin’s disease ,
and certain types of cancer in the spinal cord and brain.Research and clinical trials have demonstrated that combi-nation treatment is more effective than radiotherapy alone.
Chemotherapy is curative for only a small percent-
age of cancers. It is most effective for choriocarcinoma ,
cancer of the testis, some types of lymphomas, and can-cer of skeletal muscles.

"Biological therapies are a new and promising direc-
tion for cancer cures. Usually when cancer cells growthey manage to derive a blood supply that allows passageof nutrients promoting continuation of abnormal cancergrowth. Research that focuses on destroying these bloodvessels is called angiogenesis. Cutting off the blood sup-ply has been shown to destroy tumors, since this stopsthe flow of essential nutrients required for cancer growth.Use of certain growth factors can also stimulate self-destructive pathways in cancer cells (apoptosis). Gene
therapy is directed towards inhibiting specific cellular
signals that promote cancer cell multiplication.

"Precautions
Surgical resection requires an experienced surgeon,
preoperative assessment, imaging studies, and delicateoperative technique. Care should be taken during the pro-cedure to avoid unnecessary tumor manipulation, whichcan cause cancer cells to infiltrate adjacent structures. Ifmanipulation is excessive, cells can enter nearby areasfor future re-growth. Accurate isolation of the tumor canalso help to avoid contamination of the surgical area.Early ligation of the blood supply to the tumor is anessential component of a surgical cure.
Radiotherapy requires extensive treatment planning
and imaging. Care must be taken to localize the cancerfield while attempting to spare destruction of normal tis-sue. This requires image monitoring and exact position-ing during radiation treatment sessions.
Chemotherapy usually causes destruction of normal"
"Chemotherapy usually causes destruction of normal
cells, and cancer cells can become immune to chemicaldestruction. Side effects and patient tolerance issues aretypically anticipated and dosages may have to be specifi-cally altered. Very few chemotherapeutic agents offercurative responses.
Biological therapies may cause patient toxicity
resulting in extensive side effects. This can occur sincethe optimal dose may be exceedingly elevated above
patient tolerance.
Description

"patient tolerance.
Description
Surgery
Surgical removal of the tumor must be performed with
care and accuracy. The surgeon must avoid over manipula-tion of the surgical field. Too much movement within thearea can cause cancer cell displacement into surroundingtissue. If this occurs and no further treatment is indicated,the tumor may grow again. The surgeon should also per-form an assessment concerning tissue removal around thecancer site. Tissue around the site may not by inspectionseem cancerous, but adjacent structures may have cancercells and surrounding tissue removal is usually part of theoperative procedure. Pieces of tumor and the surroundingarea are analyzed microscopically during the operation forcell type. An adequate resection (removal of tissue) willreveal normal cells in the specimens analyzed from areasbordering the cancerous growth. Surgery can also help todecrease the tumor bulk and, along with other treatmentmeasures, may provide a cure for certain cancers."
"Not only can surgery be curative for some cancers,
but it is an essential diagnostic tool that must be assessedintraoperatively since microscopic analysis will guidethe surgeon concerning tumor and surrounding tissueremoval. These diagnostic procedures include an aspira-tion biopsy, which inserts a needle to extract (aspirate)fluid contained inside a cancerous growth; a needle biop-sy uses a specialized needle to obtain a core tissue speci-men; an incision biopsy removes a section from a largetumor; and an excision biopsy removes the entire tumor.The surgeon can also take samples of neighboring lymphnodes. Cancer in surrounding lymph nodes is an impor-tant avenue for distant spread of cancer to other areas. Ifmicroscopic analysis determines the presence of cancercells in lymph nodes then the surgeon may decide to per-form a more aggressive surgical approach.

"Radiation therapy
Similar to surgical intervention, radiotherapy is a
localized treatment. It involves the administration of ion-izing radiation to a solid tumor location. This generatesreactive oxygen molecules, causing the destruction ofDNA in local cells. There are three commonly usedradiotherapy beams: gamma rays from a linear accelera-tor machine produce a focused beam; orthovoltage raysare of less energy, thus penetrate less and typically deliv-er higher doses to superficial tissues (efficient for treat-ing skin cancers); and megavoltage rays are high energyproducing beams and can penetrate deeply situated inter-

common routes can deliver radiation. Brachytherapydelivers radiation to a local area by placing radioactivematerials within close proximity to the cancerous site.Teletherapy delivers radiation to a specific area using anexternal beam machine.
Chemotherapy
Curative chemotherapy usually requires multiple
administrations of the chemical agent. Chemotherapy orsystemic therapy is administered in the blood and circu-lates through the entire body. The choice of chemothera-peutic agents depends on the specific type of cancer.Chemotherapy is more commonly used for metastatic(malignant cancer which has spread to other areasbeyond the primary site of cancer growth) disease, sincevery few cancers are cured by systemic therapy.

"Aftercare
Patients will typically be evaluated by imaging stud-
ies, blood analysis, physical examination , and health
improvement. These follow-up visits usually occur at spe-cific time intervals during the course of treatment.

suppression. Additionally, a cell called platelets—important for normal blood clotting—may be signifi-cantly lowered, causing patients to bleed. This may beproblematic enough to limit the treatment course. Bonemarrow suppression can increase susceptibility toinfection and also cause infertility . Patients commonly
have bouts of nausea and vomiting shortly after a
treatment session. Rapidly multiplying normal cells arealso affected such as skin cells (causing blistering andulceration) and hair cells (causing loss of hair, a condi-tion called alopecia ).

"Biologic therapies risks
Biologic therapies can cause patients to develop sup-
pression of cells that help the body fight against infec-tion. Administration of certain chemicals that have anti-cancer effects can cause heart damage. Injection of killerimmune cells (lymphokine-activated killer cells) maycause bone marrow suppression, and the host may rejectthe newly introduced cells.

Definition
Palliative cancer therapy is treatment specifically
directed to help improve the symptoms associated withterminal cancer.
Purpose
Palliative care is directed to improving symptoms
associated with incurable cancer. Care can includesurgery, radiation therapy ,chemotherapy , sympto-
matic treatments resulting from cancer, and side effectsof treatment. The primary objective of palliative care isto improve the quality of remaining duration of life.Treatment usually involves a combination of modalities(multimodality approach) and numerous specialists aretypically involved in the treatment planning process.Therapeutic planning usually involves meticulous coor-dination with the treatment team.
Surgery can be utilized for palliation after careful
evaluation and planning. The use of surgery in these casesmay reduce the tumor bulk and help improve the quality oflife by relieving pain , alleviating obstruction, or control-"
"ling bleeding. Radiotherapy for terminal cancer patientscan also alleviate pain, bleeding, and obstruction of neigh-boring areas. Chemotherapy may be helpful to reducetumor size and provide some reduction to metastatic dis-ease. Long-term chemotherapy patients develop drugresistance, a situation that renders chemotherapeutic treat-ments ineffective. If this occurs patients are usually givena second line medication or, if admission criteria are met,they may participate in an experimental research protocol.Palliative treatments and terminal cancer in combinationcan cause many symptoms that can become problematic.These symptoms commonly include pain, nausea, vomit-ing, difficulty in breathing, constipation , dehydration,
agitation, and delirium . The palliative treatment-planning
goal focuses to reduce these symptoms.

"Precautions
Surgery for the purpose of tumor removal , biopsy, or
size reduction is associated with postoperative pain andlocal nerve damage, which may be both severe and difficultto alleviate. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can alsoproduce nerve damage and severe pain. Additionally,patients with malignant cancer are susceptible to infectionslike herpes, pneumonia , urinary tract infections, and
wound abscess , all of which can cause severe pain. Pain
associated with cancer and/or treatments can significantlyimpair the patient’s capabilities for performing daily tasksand hence impair quality of life. These complications maynegatively impact the patient’s psychological well being.

"Description
Pain is one of the common symptoms associated with
cancer. Approximately 75% of terminal cancer patientshave pain. Pain is a subjective symptom and thus it cannotbe measured using technological approaches. Pain can beassessed using numeric scales (from one to 10, one is ratedas no pain while 10 is severe) or rating specific facialexpressions associated with various levels of pain. Themajority of cancer patients experience pain as a result oftumor mass that compresses neighboring nerves, bone, orsoft tissues, or from direct nerve injury (neuropathic pain).Pain can occur from affected nerves in the ribs, muscles,and internal structures such as the abdomen (crampingtype pain associated with obstruction). Many patients alsoexperience various types of pain as a direct result of fol-low-up tests, treatments (surgery, radiation, and chemo-therapy) and diagnostic procedures (i.e., biopsy).

"A careful history is necessary to assess duration, sever-
ity, and location of pain. A physical examination may ver-
ify the presence of pain. Imaging analysis may further con-firm the presence of potential causes of pain. The WorldHealth Organization (WHO) recommends an analgesic lad-der. This treatment approach provides medication selec-tions based on previous analgesic use and severity of pain.The ladder starts with the use of non-opioid (non-mor-phine) drugs such as aspirin , acetaminophin, or non-"
"steroidal anti-inflammatory medications for control of mildpain. Chronic pain must be treated with constant and con-sistently administered medication(s). The “take as needed”approach is not advised. Supplemental doses may be rec-ommended in addition to the standard dose for circum-stances that may worsen pain. Opioids (i.e., morphine andcodeine) are the medications of choice for moderate tosevere pain. Doses are adjusted to produce maximum painrelief while minimizing side effects. These medications areconveniently administered orally. Administering steroidscan help reduce nausea and vomiting . Delirium and anxi-
etymay be improved by psychoactive medications.
Aftercare
Care for palliation is continuous and consistent for
the remainder of life. Patients who have less than sixmonths of life remaining may choose a hospice to stoptreatment and control pain.

Cancer therapy, supportive
Definition
Supportive cancer therapy is the use of medicines to
counteract unwanted effects of cancer treatment.
Purpose
Along with their beneficial effects, many cancer
treatments produce uncomfortable and sometimes harm-ful side effects. For example, cancer drugs may causenausea or vomiting. They may also destroy red or whiteblood cells, resulting in a low blood count . Fortunately,
many of these side effects can be relieved with othermedicines.
Description"
"many of these side effects can be relieved with othermedicines.
Description
Different kinds of drugs are used for different pur-
poses in supportive cancer therapy. To relieve nausea
and vomiting , a physician may prescribe dolasetron
(Anzemet), granisetron (Kytril) or ondansetron (Zofran).Drugs called colony stimulating factors are used to helpthe bone marrow make new white blood cells to replacethose destroyed by cancer treatment. Examples of colonystimulating factors are filgrastim (Neupogen) and sar-gramostim (Leukine). Another type of drug, epoetin(Epogen, Procrit), stimulates the bone marrow to makenew red blood cells. It is a synthetically made version ofhuman erythropoietin that is made naturally in the bodyand has the same effect on bone marrow.

"Some physicians who treat cancer recommend that
their patients use marijuana to relieve nausea and vom-
iting. This practice is controversial for several reasons.Using marijuana, even for medicinal purposes, is illegalin most states. Also, most of the evidence that marijuanaeffectively relieves nausea and vomiting comes fromreports of people who have used it, not from carefullydesigned scientific studies. An oral medication that con-tains one of the active ingredients of marijuana is avail-able with a physician’s prescription and sometimes isused to treat nausea and vomiting in patients undergoingcancer treatment. However, the drug, dronabinol (Mari-nol), takes longer to work than smoked marijuana andmay be difficult for patients with nausea and vomiting toswallow and keep down.

"In 1997, the National Institutes of Health issued a
report calling for more research into medical uses ofmarijuana. The panel of experts who wrote the reportalso recommended that researchers investigate otherways of getting the active ingredients of marijuana intothe body, such as nasal sprays, skin patches and inhalers.
Patients who want to use marijuana to relieve side
effects of cancer treatment should talk to their physiciansand should carefully consider the benefits and risks, bothmedical and legal.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
supportive cancer therapy. Check with the physician whoprescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-scription for the correct dosage.

Candidiasis
Definition
Candidiasis is an infection caused by a species of the
yeast Candida , usually Candida albicans . This is a com-
mon cause of vaginal infections in women. Also, Candida
may cause mouth infections in people with reducedimmune function, or in patients taking certain antibiotics .
Candida can be found in virtually all normal people but
causes problems in only a fraction. In recent years, howev-er, several serious categories of candidiasis have becomemore common, due to overuse of antibiotics, the rise ofAIDS , the increase in organ transplantations, and the use of
invasive devices (catheters, artificial joints and valves)—allof which increase a patient’s susceptibility to infection.
Description
V aginal candidiasis
Over one million women in the United States devel-
op vaginal yeast infections each year. It is not life-threat-ening, but it can be uncomfortable and frustrating.

"Deep organ candidiasis
Also known as invasive candidiasis, deep organ candidi-
asis is a serious systemic infection that can affect the esopha-gus, heart, blood, liver, spleen, kidneys, eyes, and skin. Likevaginal and oral candidiasis, it is an opportunistic diseasethat strikes when a person’s resistance is lowered, often dueto another illness. There are many diagnostic categories ofdeep organ candidiasis, depending on the tissues involved.
Causes and symptoms
V aginal candidiasis
Most women with vaginal candidiasis experience
severe vaginal itching . They also have a discharge that
often looks like cottage cheese and has a sweet or bread-like odor. The vulva and vagina can be red, swollen, andpainful. Sexual intercourse can also be painful.
Oral candidiasis
Whitish patches can appear on the tongue, inside of
the cheeks, or the palate. Oral candidiasis typicallyoccurs in people with abnormal immune systems. Thesecan include people undergoing chemotherapy for can-"
"cer, people taking immunosuppressive drugs to protect
transplanted organs, or people with HIV infection.
Deep organ candidiasis
Anything that weakens the body’s natural barrier
against colonizing organisms—including stomachsurgery, burns , nasogastric tubes, and catheters—can
predispose a person for deep organ candidiasis. Risingnumbers of AIDS patients, organ transplant recipients,and other individuals whose immune systems are com-promised help account for the dramatic increase in deeporgan candidiasis in recent years. Patients with granulo-cytopenia (deficiency of white blood cells) are particular-ly at risk for deep organ candidiasis.
Diagnosis
Often clinical appearance gives a strong suggestion
about the diagnosis. Generally, a clinician will take asample of the vaginal discharge or swab an area of oralplaque, and then inspect this material under a micro-scope. Under the microscope, it is possible to see charac-teristic forms of yeasts at various stages in the lifecycle."
"Fungal blood cultures should be taken for patients
suspected of having deep organ candidiasis. Tissue biop-sy may be needed for a definitive diagnosis.
Treatment
V aginal candidiasis
In most cases, vaginal candidiasis can be treated
successfully with a variety of over-the-counter antifungalcreams or suppositories. These include Monistat, Gyne-Lotrimin, and Mycelex. However, infections often recur.If a women has frequent recurrences, she should consulther doctor about prescription drugs such as Vagistat-1,Diflucan, and others.
Oral candidiasis
This is usually treated with prescription lozenges or
mouthwashes. Some of the most-used prescriptions arenystatin mouthwashes (Nilstat or Nitrostat) and clotrima-zole lozenges.

Drugs should be prescribed basedon a patient’s specific history and defense status.
Alternative treatment
Home remedies for vaginal candidiasis include vine-
gar douches or insertion of a paste made from Lacto-
bacillus acidophilus powder into the vagina. In theory,

"these remedies will make the vagina more acidic and
therefore less hospitable to the growth of Candida . Fresh
garlic ( Allium sativum ) is believed to have antifungal
action, so incorporating it into the diet or inserting agauze-wrapped, peeled garlic clove into the vagina maybe helpful. The insert should be changed twice daily.Some women report success with these remedies; theyshould try a conventional treatment if an alternative rem-edy isn’t effective.
Prognosis
V aginal candidiasis
Although most cases of vaginal candidiasis are
cured reliably, these infections can recur. To limit recur-rences, women may need to take a prescription anti-fun-gal drug such as terconazole (sold as Terazol) or takeother anti-fungal drugs on a preventive basis.
Oral candidiasis
These infections can also recur, sometimes because the
infecting Candida develops resistance to one drug. There-
fore, a physician may need to prescribe a different drug.
Deep organ candidiasis"
"fore, a physician may need to prescribe a different drug.
Deep organ candidiasis
The prognosis depends on the category of disease as
well as on the condition of the patient when the infectionstrikes. Patients who are already suffering from a seriousunderlying disease are more susceptible to deep organcandidiasis that speads throughout the body.
Prevention
Because Candida is part of the normal group of
microorganisms that co-exist with all people, it is impos-sible to avoid contact with it. Good vaginal hygiene and
good oral hygiene might reduce problems, but they are
not guarantees against candidiasis.
Because hospital-acquired (nosocomial) deep organ
candidiasis is on the rise, people need to be made awareof it. Patients should be sure that catheters are properlymaintained and used for the shortest possible timelength. The frequency, length, and scope of courses ofantibiotic treatment should also be cut back.

Canker sores occur on the inside of the mouth, usu-
ally on the inside of the lips, cheeks, and/or soft palate.They can also occur on the tongue and in the throat.Often, several canker sores will appear at the same timeand may be grouped in clusters. Canker sores appear as awhitish, round area with a red border. The sores arepainful and sensitive to touch. The average canker sore isabout one-quarter inch in size, although they can occa-sionally be larger. Canker sores are not infectious.
Approximately 20% of the U.S. population is affect-
ed with recurring canker sores, and more women thanmen get them. Women are more likely to have cankersores during their premenstrual period.
Canker sores are sometimes confused with cold
sores. Cold sores are caused by herpes simplex virus.This disease, also known as oral herpes or fever blisters,"
"can occur anywhere on the body. Most commonly, her-pes infection occurs on the outside of the lips and thegums, and much less frequently on the inside the mouth.Cold sores are infectious.
Causes and symptoms
The exact cause of canker sores is uncertain, howev-
er, they seem to be related to a localized immune reac-tion. Other proposed causes for this disease are trauma tothe affected areas from toothbrush scrapes, stress , hor-
mones, and food allergies . Canker sores tend to appear
in response to stress. The initial symptom is a tingling ormildly painful itching sensation in the area where the
sore will appear. After one to several days, a small redswelling appears. The sore is round, and is a whitishcolor with a grayish colored center. Usually, there is a redring of inflammation surrounding the sore. The mainsymptom is pain . Canker sores can be very painful, espe-
cially if they are touched repeatedly, e.g., by the tongue.They last for one to two weeks.KEY TERMS"

enseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ), may be helpful in the
treatment of existing sores. Compresses soaked in teasmade from these herbs are applied directly to the sores.The tannic acid in a tea bag can also help dry up the soreswhen the wet tea bag is used as a compress. Taking dan-delion ( Taraxacum officinale ) tea or capsules may help"
"heal sores and also prevent future outbreaks. Sincecanker sores are often brought on by stress, such stress-relieving techniques as meditation ,guided imagery ,
and certain acupressure exercises may help prevent
canker sores or lessen their severity.
Prognosis
There is no cure for canker sores. They do not get
larger or occur more frequently with age.

"Carbohydrate intolerance
Definition
Carbohydrate intolerance is the inability of the body
to completely process the nutrient carbohydrate (a classi-fication that includes sugars and starches) into a source ofenergy for the body, usually because of the deficiency ofan enzyme needed for digestion. Lactose intolerance , the
inability to digest the sugar found in milk, is widespreadand affects up to 70% of the world’s adult population.
Description
Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy and,
along with fats and proteins, one of the three major nutri-ents in the human diet. Carbohydrates are classifiedaccording to their structure based on the number of basicsugar, or saccharide units they contain.
A monosaccharide is the simplest carbohydrate and"
"A monosaccharide is the simplest carbohydrate and
called a simple sugar. Simple sugars include glucose (theform in which sugar circulates in the blood), fructose(found in fruit and honey), and galactose (produced bythe digestion of milk). These simple sugars are importantbecause they can be absorbed by the small intestine. Twosimple sugars linked together make a disaccharide. Thedisaccharide sugars present in the diet are maltose (aproduct of the digestion of starch), sucrose (table sugar),and lactose (the sugar in milk). These disaccharides mustbe broken down by enzymes into two simple sugars sothat they can be absorbed by the intestine. Polysaccha-rides are much more complex carbohydrates made up ofmany simple sugars, the most important of which areglycogen, which is stored in the liver, and starch.
Digestion of sugars

"Digestion of sugars
Digestion of food begins in the mouth, moves on to
the stomach, and then into the small intestine. Along theway, specific enzymes are needed to process differenttypes of sugars. An enzyme is a substance that acts as acatalyst to produce chemical changes without beingchanged itself. The enzymes lactase, maltase, and isoma-ltase (or sucrase) are needed to break down the disaccha-rides; when one or more is inadequate, the result is car-bohydrate intolerance.
Types of intolerance
Carbohydrate intolerance can be primary or sec-
ondary. Primary deficiency is caused by an enzyme defectpresent at birth or developed over time. The most commonis lactose intolerance. Secondary deficiencies are causedby a disease or disorder of the intestinal tract, and disap-pear when the disease is treated. These include proteindeficiency, celiac disease , and some intestinal infections.
Adult lactose intolerance is the most common of all"
"Adult lactose intolerance is the most common of all
enzyme deficiencies, and it is estimated that 30–50 mil-lion Americans have this condition. Some racial and eth-nic populations are affected more than others. Lactoseintolerance is found in as many as 75% of African Ameri-cans, Jewish Americans, Mexican Americans, and NativeAmericans, and in 90% of Asian Americans. Descendantsof Northern Europeans and some Mediterranean peoplesusually do not develop the condition. Deficiencies inenzymes other than lactase are extremely rare.
Causes and symptoms
Enzymes play an important role in breaking down
carbohydrates into forms that can pass through the intes-tine and be used by the body. Usually they are named byadding aseto the name of the substance they act on, so"
"lactase is the enzyme needed to process lactose. Cookedstarch is broken down in the mouth to a disaccharide byamylase, an enzyme in the saliva. The disaccharides mal-tose, sucrose, and lactose cannot be absorbed until theyhave been separated into simple sugar molecules by theircorresponding enzymes present in the cells lining theintestinal tract. If this process is not completed, digestionis interrupted.
Although not common, a deficiency in the enzymes
needed to digest lactose, maltose, and sucrose is some-times present at birth. Intestinal lactase enzymes usuallydecrease naturally with age, but this happens to varyingdegrees. Because of the uneven distribution of enzymedeficiency based on race and ethnic heritage, especiallyin lactose intolerance, genetics are believed to play a rolein the cause of primary carbohydrate intolerance.
Digestive diseases such as celiac disease and tropi-"
"Digestive diseases such as celiac disease and tropi-
cal sprue (which affect absorption in the intestine), aswell as intestinal infections and injuries, can reduce theamount of enzymes produced. In cancer patients, treat-
ment with radiation therapy or chemotherapy may
affect the cells in the intestine that normally secrete lac-tase, leading to intolerance.
The severity of the symptoms depends on the extent
of the enzyme deficiency, and range from a feeling ofmild bloating to severe diarrhea . In the case of a lactase
deficiency, undigested milk sugar remains in the intes-tine, which is then fermented by the bacteria normallypresent in the intestine. These bacteria produce gas,cramping, bloating, a “gurgly” feeling in the abdomen,and flatulence. In a growing child, the main symptomsare diarrhea and a failure to gain weight. In an individualwith lactase deficiency, gastrointestinal distress begins"
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 649Carbohydrate intoleranceGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 649
"about 30 minutes to two hours after eating or drinking
foods containing lactose. Food intolerances can be con-fused with food allergies , since the symptoms of nausea,
cramps, bloating, and diarrhea are similar.
Sugars that aren’t broken down into one of the sim-
plest forms cause the body to push fluid into the intestines,which results in watery diarrhea (osmotic diarrhea). Diar-rhea may sweep other nutrients out of the intestine beforethey can be absorbed, causing malnutrition .
Diagnosis
Carbohydrate intolerance can be diagnosed using
oral tolerance tests. The carbohydrate being investigatedis given by mouth in liquid form and several blood levelsare measured and compared to normal values. This helpsevaluate the individual’s ability to digest the sugar.
To identify lactose intolerance in children and"
"To identify lactose intolerance in children and
adults, the hydrogen breath test is used to measure theamount of hydrogen in the breath. The patient drinks abeverage containing lactose and the breath is analyzedat regular intervals. If undigested lactose in the largeintestine (colon) is fermented by bacteria, various gasesare produced. Hydrogen is absorbed from the intestinesKEY TERMS

"Enzyme —A substance produced by the body to
assist in a chemical reaction. In carbohydrateintolerance, lack of an enzyme makes it impossi-ble for one type of sugar to be broken down into asimpler form so that it can be absorbed by theintestines and used by the body.
Metabolism —All the physical and chemical

Nutrient —Food or another substance that supplies
the body with the elements needed for metabolism.
Sugars —Those carbohydrates having the general
composition of one part carbon, two parts hydro-gen, and one part oxygen.and carried by the bloodstream into the lungs where it

"When lactose intolerance is suspected in infants and
young children, many pediatricians recommend simplychanging from cow’s milk to soy formula and watchingfor improvement. If needed, a stool sample can be testedfor acidity. The inadequate digestion of lactose will resultin an increase of acid in the waste matter excreted by thebowels and the presence of glucose.
Treatment
Carbohydrate intolerance caused by temporary
intestinal diseases disappears when the condition is suc-cessfully treated. In primary conditions, no treatmentexists to improve the body’s ability to produce theenzymes, but symptoms can be controlled by diet.

"Because the degree of lactose intolerance varies so
much, treatment should be tailored for the individual.Young children showing signs of intolerance shouldavoid milk products; infants should switch to soy-basedformula. Older children and adults can adjust their intakeof lactose depending on how much and what they cantolerate. For some, a small glass of milk will not causeproblems, while others may be able to handle ice creamor aged cheeses such as cheddar or Swiss, but not otherdairy products. Generally, small amounts of lactose-con-taining foods taken throughout the day are better tolerat-ed than a large amount consumed all at once.

"For those individuals who are sensitive to even very
small amounts of lactose, the lactase enzyme is availablewithout a prescription. It comes in liquid form for usewith milk. The addition of a few drops to a quart of milkwill reduce the lactose content by 70% after 24 hours inthe refrigerator. Heating the milk speeds up the process,and doubling the amount of lactase liquid will result inmilk that is 90% lactose free. Chewable lactase enzymetablets are also available. Three to six tablets takenbefore a meal or snack will aid in the digestion of solidfoods. Lactose-reduced milk and other products are alsoavailable in stores. The milk contains the same nutrientsas regular milk.

"Carbon monoxide poisoning
Definition
Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning occurs when car-
bon monoxide gas is inhaled. CO is a colorless, odorless,highly poisonous gas that is produced by incompletecombustion. It is found in automobile exhaust fumes,faulty stoves and heating systems, fires, and cigarettesmoke. Other sources include woodburning stoves,kerosene heaters, improperly ventilated water heatersand gas stoves, and blocked or poorly maintained chim-ney flues. CO interferes with the ability of the blood tocarry oxygen. The result is headache , nausea, convul-
sions, and finally death by asphyxiation.
Description
Carbon monoxide, sometimes called coal gas, has
been known as a toxic substance since the third century
B.C. It was used for executions and suicides in early Rome.
Today it is the leading cause of accidental poisoning in theUnited States. According to the Journal of the American
Medical Association , 1,500 Americans die each year from"
"Medical Association , 1,500 Americans die each year from
accidental exposure to CO, and another 2,300 from inten-tional exposure (suicide). An additional 10,000 peopleseek medical attention after exposure to CO and recover.Anyone who is exposed to CO will become sick, and
the entire body is involved in CO poisoning. A develop-ing fetus can also be poisoned if a pregnant womanbreathes CO gas. Infants, people with heart or lung dis-ease, or those with anemia may be more seriously affect-ed. People such as underground parking garage atten-dants who are exposed to car exhausts in a confined areaare more likely to be poisoned by CO. Firemen also run ahigher risk of inhaling CO.

"Causes and symptoms
Normally when a person breathes fresh air into the
lungs, the oxygen in the air binds with a molecule calledhemoglobin (Hb) that is found in red blood cells. Thisallows oxygen to be moved from the lungs to every partof the body. When the oxygen/hemoglobin complexreaches a muscle where it is needed, the oxygen isreleased. Because the oxygen binding process isreversible, hemoglobin can be used over and over againto pick up oxygen and move it throughout the body.
Inhaling carbon monoxide gas interferes with this"
"Inhaling carbon monoxide gas interferes with this
oxygen transport system. In the lungs, CO competes withoxygen to bind with the hemoglobin molecule. Hemo-globin prefers CO to oxygen and accepts it more than200 times more readily than it accepts oxygen. Not onlydoes the hemoglobin prefer CO, it holds on to the COmuch more tightly, forming a complex called carboxyhe-moglobin (COHb). As a person breathes CO contaminat-ed air, more and more oxygen transportation sites on thehemoglobin molecules become blocked by CO. Gradual-ly, there are fewer and fewer sites available for oxygen.All cells need oxygen to live. When they don’t getenough oxygen, cellular metabolism is disrupted andeventually cells begin to die.
The symptoms of CO poisoning and the speed with"
"The symptoms of CO poisoning and the speed with
which they appear depend on the concentration of CO inthe air and the rate and efficiency with which a personbreathes. Heavy smokers can start off with up to 9% oftheir hemoglobin already bound to CO, which they regu-larly inhale in cigarette smoke. This makes them muchmore susceptible to environmental CO. The Occupation-al Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has estab-lished a maximum permissible exposure level of 50 partsper million (ppm) over eight hours.
With exposure to 200 ppm for two to three hours, a
person begins to experience headache, fatigue , nausea,
and dizziness . These symptoms correspond to 15–25%
COHb in the blood. When the concentration of COHbreaches 50% or more, death results in a very short time.Emergency room physicians have the most experiencediagnosing and treating CO poisoning.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 651Carbon monoxide poisoningGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 651"
"The symptoms of CO poisoning in order of increas-
ing severity include:
• headache
• shortness of breath
• dizziness
• fatigue• mental confusion and difficulty thinking
• loss of fine hand-eye coordination
• nausea and vomiting• rapid heart rate
• hallucinations
• inability to execute voluntary movements accurately• collapse
• lowered body temperature ( hypothermia )
• coma• convulsions• seriously low blood pressure
• cardiac and respiratory failure
• death
In some cases, the skin, mucous membranes, and
nails of a person with CO poisoning are cherry red orbright pink. Because the color change doesn’t alwaysoccur, it is an unreliable symptom to rely on for diagnosis.

"Although most CO poisoning is acute, or sudden, it is
possible to suffer from chronic CO poisoning. This condi-tion exists when a person is exposed to low levels of the gasover a period of days to months. Symptoms are often vagueand include (in order of frequency) fatigue, headache,dizziness, sleep disturbances, cardiac symptoms, apathy,nausea, and memory disturbances. Little is known aboutchronic CO poisoning, and it is often misdiagnosed.KEY TERMS
Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) —Hemoglobin that
is bound to carbon monoxide instead of oxygen.
Hemoglobin (Hb) —A molecule that normally
binds to oxygen in order to carry it to our cells,where it is required for life.
Hypothermia —Development of a subnormal body
temperature.
pH—A measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of
a fluid. A neutral fluid, neither acid nor alkali, hasa pH of 7.Diagnosis
The main reason to suspect CO poisoning is evidence"
"The main reason to suspect CO poisoning is evidence
that fuel is being burned in a confined area, for example acar running inside a closed garage, a charcoal grill burn-ing indoors, or an unvented kerosene heater in a work-shop. Under these circumstances, one or more personssuffering from the symptoms listed above strongly sug-gests CO poisoning. In the absence of some concrete rea-son to suspect CO poisoning, the disorder is often misdi-agnosed as migraine headache ,stroke , psychiatric ill-
ness, food poisoning , alcohol poisoning, or heart disease.
Concrete confirmation of CO poisoning comes from
a carboxyhemoglobin test. This blood test measures theamount of CO that is bound to hemoglobin in the body.Blood is drawn as soon after suspected exposure to COas possible.
Other tests that are useful in determining the extent
of CO poisoning include measurement of other arterialblood gases and pH; a complete blood count ; measure-"
"ment of other blood components such as sodium, potassi-um, bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, and lactic acid; an elec-trocardiogram (ECG); and a chest x ray .
Treatment
Immediate treatment for CO poisoning is to remove
the victim from the source of carbon monoxide gas andget him or her into fresh air. If the victim is not breathingand has no pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR ) should be started. Depending on the severity of
the poisoning, 100% oxygen may be given with a tightfitting mask as soon as it is available.
Taken with other symptoms of CO poisoning, COHb
levels of over 25% in healthy individuals, over 15% inpatients with a history of heart or lung disease, and over10% in pregnant women usually indicate the need forhospitalization. In the hospital, fluids and electrolytes aregiven to correct any imbalances that have arisen from thebreakdown of cellular metabolism.
In severe cases of CO poisoning, patients are given"
"In severe cases of CO poisoning, patients are given
hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This treatment involves plac-ing the patient in a chamber breathing 100% oxygen at apressure of more than one atmosphere (the normal pres-sure the atmosphere exerts at sea level). The increasedpressure forces more oxygen into the blood. Hyperbaricfacilities are specialized, and are usually available only atlarger hospitals.
Prognosis
The speed and degree of recovery from CO poison-
ing depends on the length and duration of exposure to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 652Carbon monoxide poisoningGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 652"
"the gas. The half-life of CO in normal room air is four to
five hours. This means that, in four to five hours, half ofthe CO bound to hemoglobin will be replaced with oxy-gen. At normal atmospheric pressures, but breathing100% oxygen, the half-life for the elimination of COfrom the body is 50-70 minutes. In hyperbaric therapy atthree atmospheres of pressure, the half-life is reduced to20-25 minutes.
Although the symptoms of CO poisoning may sub-
side in a few hours, some patients show memory prob-lems, fatigue, confusion, and mood changes for two tofour weeks after their exposure to the gas.
Prevention
Carbon monoxide poisoning is preventable. Particu-
lar care should be paid to situations where fuel is burnedin a confined area. Portable and permanently installedcarbon monoxide detectors that sound a warning similarto smoke detectors are available for under $50. Specificactions that will prevent CO poisoning include:

"Definition
The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test is a labo-
ratory blood study. CEA is a substance which is normallyfound only during fetal development, but may reappearin adults who develop certain types of cancer .
Purpose
The CEA test is ordered for patients with known
cancers. The CEA test is most commonly ordered when apatient has a cancer of the gastrointestinal system. Theseinclude cancer of the colon, rectum, stomach (gastriccancer), esophagus, liver, or pancreas. It is also used withcancers of the breast, lung, or prostate.
The CEA level in the blood is one of the factors that
doctors consider when determining the prognosis, ormost likely outcome of a cancer. In general, a higherCEA level predicts a more severe disease, one that is lesslikely to be curable. But it does not give clear-cut infor-mation. The results of a CEA test are usually consideredalong with other laboratory and/or imaging studies to fol-low the course of the disease."
"Once treatment for the cancer has begun, CEA tests
have a valuable role in monitoring the patient’s progress.A decreasing CEA level means therapy is effective infighting the cancer. A stable or increasing CEA level maymean the treatment is not working, and/or that the tumoris growing. It is important to understand that serial CEAmeasurements, which means several done over a periodof time, are the most useful. A single test result is diffi-cult to evaluate, but a number of tests, done weeks apart,shows trends in disease progression or regression.
Certain types of cancer treatments, such as hormone
therapy for breast cancer , may actually cause the CEA"
"therapy for breast cancer , may actually cause the CEA
level to go up. This elevation does not accurately reflectthe state of the disease. It is sometimes referred to as a“flare response.” Recognition that a rise in CEA may betemporary and due to therapy is significant. If this possi-bility is not taken into account, the patient may be unnec-essarily discouraged. Further, treatment that is actuallyeffective may be stopped or changed prematurely.
CEA tests are also used to help detect recurrence of a
cancer after surgery and/or other treatment has been com-pleted. A rising CEA level may be the first sign of cancerreturn, and may show up months before other studies orpatient symptoms would raise concern. Unfortunately, thisdoes not always mean the recurrent cancer can be cured.For example, only a small percentage of patients with col-orectal cancers and rising CEA levels will benefit from"
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 653Carcinoembryonic antigen testGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 653
"another surgical exploration. Those with recurrence in the
same area as the original cancer, or with a single metastat-ic tumor in the liver or lung, have a chance that surgerywill eliminate the disease. Patients with more widespreadreturn of the cancer are generally not treatable withsurgery. The CEA test will not separate the two groups.
Patients who are most likely to benefit from non-
standard treatments, such as bone marrow transplants,may be determined on the basis of CEA values, com-bined with other test results. CEA levels may be one ofthe criteria for determining whether the patient will bene-fit from more expensive studies, such as CT scan or MRI.
Precautions
The CEA test is not a screening test for cancer. It is
not useful for detecting the presence of cancer. Manycancers do not produce an increased CEA level. Somenoncancerous diseases, such as hepatitis, inflammatorybowel disease, pancreatitis , and obstructive pulmonary
disease, may cause an elevated CEA level.
Description"
"disease, may cause an elevated CEA level.
Description
Determination of the CEA level is a laboratory
blood test. Obtaining a specimen of blood for the studytakes only a few minutes. CEA testing should be coveredby most insurance plans.
Preparation
No preparation is required.
Aftercare
None.
Risks
There are no complications or side effects of this
test. However, the results of a CEA study should be inter-preted with caution. A single test result may not yieldclinically useful information. Several studies over a peri-od of months may be needed.
Another concern is the potential for false positive as
well as false negative results. A false positive resultmeans the test shows an abnormal value when cancer isnot present. A false negative means the test reveals a nor-mal value when cancer actually is present.
Normal results
The absolute numbers which are considered normal
vary from one laboratory to another. Any results reportedshould come with information regarding the testing facil-"
"ity’s normal range.
Abnormal results
A single abnormal CEA value may be significant,
but must be regarded cautiously. In general, very highCEA levels indicate more serious cancer, with a poorerchance for cure. But some benign diseases and certaincancer treatments may produce an elevated CEA test.Cigarette smoking will also cause the CEA level to be
abnormally high.

"Purpose
The left ventricle is the main pump for distributing
blood through the body. A cardiac blood pool scan isused to determine how efficiently the left ventricle isworking. The scan can detect aneurysms of the left ven-tricle, motion abnormalities caused by damage to theheart wall, cardiac shunts between the left and right ven-tricle, and coronary occlusive artery disease.
Precautions
Pregnant women are the only patients who should
not participate in a cardiac blood pool scan. However, theaccuracy of the results may be affected if the patientmoves during imaging, has had other recent nuclearscans, or has an irregular heartbeat.

"Description
A cardiac blood pool scan is sometimes called
equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography or gated(synchronized) cardiac blood pool imaging. A multi-
ple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan is a variation of
this test.
To perform a cardiac blood pool scan, the patient
lies under a special gamma scintillation camera thatdetects radiation. A protein tagged with a radioactivemarker (usually technetium-99m) is injected into thepatient’s forearm.
The camera is synchronized with an electrocardio-
gram (ECG) to take a picture at specific times in thecycle of heart contraction and relaxation. When datafrom many sequential pictures is processed by a comput-er, a doctor can analyze whether the left ventricle is func-tioning normally.
The patient needs to remain silent and motionless
during the test. Sometimes the patient is asked to exer-
cise, then another set of pictures is taken for comparison.
This test normally takes about 30 minutes.
Preparation"
"This test normally takes about 30 minutes.
Preparation
No changes in diet or medication are necessary. An
ECG will probably be done before the test.
Aftercare
The patient may resume normal activities immedi-
ately.
Risks
Cardiac blood pool scans are a safe and effective
way of measuring left ventricle function. The only risk isto the fetus of a pregnant woman.
Normal results
A computer is used to process the information from
the test, then the results are analyzed by a doctor. A nor-mally functioning left ventricle will contract symmetri-cally, show even distribution of the radioactively taggedprotein, and eject about 55–65% of volume of blood itholds on each contraction.
Abnormal results
Patients with damage to the ventricle or heart wall
will show an uneven distribution of the radiopharmaceu-tical. The volume of blood ejected in each contractionwill be less than 55%.KEY TERMS

"Cardiac catheterization
Definition
Cardiac catheterization (also called heart catheteri-
zation) is a diagnostic procedure which does a compre-hensive examination of how the heart and its blood ves-sels function. One or more catheters is inserted through aperipheral blood vessel in the arm (antecubital artery orvein) or leg (femoral artery or vein) with x-ray guidance.This procedure gathers information such as adequacy ofblood supply through the coronary arteries, blood pres-sures, blood flow throughout chambers of the heart, col-lection of blood samples, and x rays of the heart’s ventri-cles or arteries.
A test that can be performed on either side of the
heart, cardiac catheterization checks for different func-tions in both the left and right sides. When testing theheart’s right side, tricuspid and pulmonary valve function

collecting blood samples from the right atrium, ventricle,and pulmonary artery. Left-sided heart catheterization isperformed by way of a catheter through an artery whichtests the blood flow of the coronary arteries, function ofthe mitral and aortic valves, and left ventricle.
Purpose
The primary reason for conducting a cardiac
catheterization is to diagnose and manage persons knownor suspected to have heart disease, a frequently fatal con-dition that leads to 1.5 million heart attacks annually inthe United States.
Symptoms and diagnoses that may lead to perform-

Typically performed along with angiography , a tech-
nique of injecting a dye into the vascular system to outlinethe heart and blood vessels, a catheterization can aid in thevisualization of any blockages, narrowing, or abnormalitiesin the coronary arteries. If these signs are visible, the cardi-ologist may assess the patient’s need and readiness forcoronary bypass surgery, or perhaps a less invasiveapproach, such as dilation of a narrowed blood vessel eithersurgically or with the use of a balloon ( angioplasty ).
When looking at the left side of the heart, fluoro-
scopic guidance also allows the following diagnoses tobe assessed:
• enlargement of the left ventricle• ventricular aneurysms (abnormal dilation of a blood
vessel)
• narrowing of the aortic valve• insufficiency of the aortic or mitral valve• the detour of blood from one side of the heart to the"
"other due to septal defects (also known as shunting)
Precautions
Cardiac catheterization is categorized as an “inva-
sive” procedure which involves the heart, its valves, andcoronary arteries, in addition to a large artery in the arm
or leg. Due to the nature of the test, it is important toevaluate for the following conditions before consideringthis procedure:
• A diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, poor kidney func-
tion, or debilitation. Any of these pre-existing condi-tions typically raises the risk of the catheterization pro-cedure and may be reason to cancel the procedure.
• A diagnosis of heart valve disease. If this is detected,
antibiotics may be given before the test to prevent
inflammation of the membrane which lines the heart(endocarditis).

"Description
To understand how a cardiac catheterization is able
to diagnose and manage heart disease, the basic work-ings of the heart muscle must also be understood. Just asthe body relies on a constant supply of blood to aid in itseveryday functions, so does the heart. The heart is madeup of an intricate web of blood vessels (coronary arter-ies) that ensure an adequate supply of blood rich in oxy-gen and nutrients. It is easy to see how an abnormality inany of these arteries can be detrimental to the heart’sfunction. These abnormalities cause the heart’s bloodflow to decrease and result in the condition known ascoronary artery disease or coronary insufficiency.
Catheterization is a valuable tool in detecting and
treating abnormalities of the heart. Through the use offluoroscopic (x ray) guidance, a catheter, which mayresemble a balloon-tipped tube, is strung through theveins or arteries into the heart, so the cardiologist canmonitor a body’s various functions at each moment."
"Generally a test that lasts two to three hours, a
patient should expect the following prior to and duringthe catheterization procedure:
• A mild sedative may be given that will allow the patient
to relax but remain conscious during the test.
• An intravenous needle will be inserted in the arm to
administer medication. Electrodes will be attached tothe chest to enable the painless procedure known as anelectrocardiograph.
• Prior to inserting a catheter into an artery or vein in the
arm or leg, the incision site will be made numb byinjecting a local anesthetic. When the anesthetic isinjected it may feel like a pin-prick followed by a quickstinging sensation. Pressure may also be experienced asthe catheter travels through the blood vessel.
• After the catheter is guided into the coronary-artery
system, a dye (also called a radiocontrast material) isinjected to aid in the identification of any abnormalities"
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 656Cardiac catheterizationGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 656
"of the heart. During this time, the patient may experi-
ence a hot, flushed feeling or a quickly passing nausea.Coughing or breathing deeply aids in any discomfort.
• Medication may be given during the procedure if chest
pain is experienced, and nitroglycerin may also be admin-istered to allow expansion of the heart’s blood vessels.
• When the test is complete, the physician will remove the
catheter and close the skin with several sutures or tape.
Preparation
Prior to the cardiac catheterization procedure, it is
important to relay information to the physician or nurseregarding allergies to shellfish (such as shrimp or scal-
lops) which contain iodine, iodine itself, or the dyes thatare commonly used in other diagnostic tests.
Because this procedure is categorized as a surgery, the"
"Because this procedure is categorized as a surgery, the
patient will be instructed not to eat or drink anything for atleast six hours prior to the test. Just before the test begins,the patient will urinate and change into a hospital gown,then lie flat on a padded table that may also be tilted inorder for the heart to be examined from a variety of angles.
Aftercare
While cardiac catheterization may be performed on
an outpatient basis, a patient may require close monitor-ing following the procedure while remaining in the hos-pital for at least 24 hours. The patient will be instructedto rest in bed for at least eight hours immediately afterthe test. If the catheter was inserted into a vein or arteryin the leg or groin area, the leg will be kept extended forfour to six hours. If a vein or artery in the arm was usedto insert the catheter, the arm will need to remain extend-ed for a minimum of three hours.
The patient should expect a hard ridge to form over"
"The patient should expect a hard ridge to form over
the incision site that diminishes as the site heals. Bluishdiscoloration under the skin at the point of insertionshould also be expected but fades in two weeks. It is alsonot uncommon for the incision site to bleed during thefirst 24 hours following surgery. If this should happen,the patient should apply pressure to the site with a cleantissue or cloth for 10–15 minutes.
Risks
Similar to all surgical procedures, the cardiac
catheterization test does involve some risks. Complica-tions that may occur during the procedure include
• cardiac arrhythmias (an irregular heart beat)
• pericardial tamponade (a condition that causes excess
pressure in the pericardium which affects the heart dueto accumulation of excess fluid)• the rare occurrence of myocardial infarction (heart
attack) or stroke may also develop due to clotting or
plaque rupture of one or more of the coronary or brainarteries.
Before left-side catheterization is performed, the"
"Before left-side catheterization is performed, the
anticoagulant medication heparin may be administered.This drug helps decrease the risk of the development of ablood clot in an artery (thrombosis) and blood clots trav-eling throughout the body (embolization).
The risks of the catheterization procedure increase
in patients over the age of 60, those who have severeheart failure , or persons with serious valvular heart
disease .
Normal results
Normal findings from a cardiac catheterization will
indicate no abnormalities of heart chamber size or con-figuration, wall motion or thickness, the direction ofblood flow, or motion of the valves. Smooth and regularoutlines on the x ray indicate normal coronary arteries.
An essential part of the catheterization is measuring
intracardiac pressures, or the pressure in the heart’schambers and vessels. Pressure readings that are higher

"than normal are significant for a patient’s overall diagno-
sis. The pressure readings that are lower, other than thosewhich are produced as a result of shock , typically are not
significant.
An ejection fraction, or a comparison of how much
blood is ejected from the heart’s left ventricle during itscontraction phase with a measurement of blood remain-ing at the end of the left ventricle’s relaxation phase, isalso determined by performing a catheterization. Thecardiologist will look for a normal ejection fraction read-ing of 60–70%.
Abnormal results
Cardiac catheterization provides valuable still and
motion x-ray pictures of the coronary arteries that help indiagnosing coronary artery disease, poor heart function,disease of the heart valves, and septal defects (a defect inthe septum, the wall that separates two heart chambers).
The most prominent sign of coronary artery disease"
"The most prominent sign of coronary artery disease
is the narrowing or blockage in the coronary arteries,with narrowing that is greater than 70% considered sig-nificant. A clear indication for intervention (by angio-plasty or surgery) is a finding of significant narrowingof the left main coronary artery and/or blockage orsevere narrowing in the high, left anterior descendingcoronary artery.KEY TERMS

Definition
Cardiac rehabilitation is a comprehensive exercise ,
education, and behavioral modification program designedto improve the physical and emotional condition ofpatients with heart disease.
Purpose
Heart attack survivors, bypass and angioplasty
patients, and individuals with angina , congestive heart
failure , and heart transplants are all candidates for a car-
diac rehabilitation program. Cardiac rehabilitation is pre-scribed to control symptoms, improve exercise tolerance,and improve the overall quality of life in these patients.
Precautions
A cardiac rehabilitation program should be imple-
mented and closely monitored by a trained team ofhealthcare professionals.Description
Cardiac rehabilitation is overseen by a specialized"
"Cardiac rehabilitation is overseen by a specialized
team of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare profession-als. Members of the cardiac rehabilitation team mayinclude a dietician or nutritionist, physical therapist,exercise physiologist, psychologist, vocational coun-selor, occupational therapist, and social worker. The pro-gram frequently begins in a hospital setting and contin-ues on an outpatient basis after the patient is dischargedover a period of six to 12 months.
Components of a cardiac rehabilitation program
vary by individual clinical need, and each program willbe carefully constructed for the patient by his or her reha-bilitation team.
• Exercise. Exercise programs typically start out slowly,
with simple range-of-motion arm and leg exercises.Walking and stair climbing soon follow. Blood pressureis carefully monitored before and after exercise ses-

"sions, and patients are taught how to measure their
heart rate and evaluate any possible cardiac symptomsduring each session. Patients with advanced coronarydisease may require continuous ECG monitoringthroughout their exercise sessions. Once dischargedfrom the hospital, the patient works with his cardiacteam to create an individual exercise plan.
• Diet. Cardiac patients will work with a nutritionist or
dietician to develop a low-fat, low-cholesterol dietplan. Patients with high blood pressure may be put on asalt-restricted diet and instructed to limit alcoholintake. Weight loss may also be a goal with obese car-diac patients.
• Counseling. A psychologist or social worker can help
cardiac patients with issues that may be contributing totheir heart condition, such as stress and anxiety . Relax-"
"ation techniques may be taught to patients to help themdeal with these feelings. Cardiac patients frequentlyexperience a period of depression, and group or indi-vidual counseling can be beneficial in overcomingthese feelings. V ocational counselors can assist cardiacpatients in returning to the workforce.
• Education. The patient and family should be fully edu-
cated on the physical limitations of the patient, his rec-ommended diet and exercise plan, his emotional status,and the lifestyle changes required to improve thepatient’s overall health.

depends on a number of variables, including patient fol-low-through, type and degree of heart disease, and theavailability of an adequate support network for thepatient. Patients who successfully complete the programwill ideally reach an age-appropriate level of physicalactivity and be able to return to the workforce and/orother daily activities.

Cardiac tamponade
Definition
Cardiac tamponade occurs when the heart is
squeezed by fluid that collects inside the sac that sur-rounds it.
Description
The heart is surrounded by a sac called the pericardi-
um. When this sac becomes filled with fluid, the liquidpresses on the heart, preventing the lower chambers ofthe heart from properly filling with blood.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 660Cardiac tamponadeGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 660"
"Because the lower chambers (the ventricles) cannot fill
with the correct amount of blood, less than normal amountsof blood reach the lungs and the rest of the body. This con-dition is very serious and can be fatal if not treated.
Causes and symptoms
Fluid can collect inside the pericardium and com-
press the heart when the kidneys do not properly removewaste from the blood, when the pericardium swells fromunknown causes, from infection, or when the pericardiumis damaged by cancer . Blunt or penetrating injury from
trauma to the chest or heart can also result in cardiac tam-ponade when large amounts of blood fill the pericardium.Tamponade can also occur during heart surgery.
When the heart is compressed by the surrounding"
"When the heart is compressed by the surrounding
fluid, three conditions occur: a reduced amount of bloodis pumped to the body by the heart, the lower chambersof the ventricles are filled with a less than normal amountof blood, and higher than normal blood pressures occurinside the heart, caused by the pressure of the fluid push-ing in on the heart from the outside.
When tamponade occurs because of trauma, the
sound of the heart beats can become faint, and the bloodpressure in the arteries decreases, while the blood pres-sure in the veins increases.
In cases of tamponade caused by more slowly devel-
oping diseases, shortness of breath , a feeling of tight-
ness in the chest, increased blood pressure in the largeveins in the neck (the jugular veins), weight gain, andfluid retention by the body can occur.
Diagnosis

"Diagnosis
When cardiac tamponade is suspected, accurate diag-
nosis can be life-saving. The most accurate way to identi-fy this condition is by using a test called an echocardio-gram. This test uses sound waves to create an image ofthe heart and its surrounding sac, making it easy to visual-ize any fluid that has collected inside the sac.
Treatment
If the abnormal fluid buildup in the pericardial sac is
caused by cancer or kidney disease, drugs used to treatthese conditions can help lessen the amount of fluid col-lecting inside the sac. Drugs that help maintain normalblood pressure throughout the body can also help thiscondition; however, these drugs are only a temporarytreatment. The fluid within the pericardium must bedrained out to reduce the pressure on the heart andrestore proper heart pumping.
The fluid inside the pericardium is drained by insert-
ing a needle through the chest and into the sac itself. ThisKEY TERMS

"Pericardiocentesis —A procedure used to drain
fluid out of the sac surrounding the heart. This isdone by inserting a needle through the chest andinto the sac.
allows the fluid to flow out of the sac, relieving the
abnormal pressure on the heart. This procedure is calledpericardiocentesis . In severe cases, a tube (catheter) can
be inserted into the sac or a section of the sac can be sur-gically cut away to allow for more drainage.
Prognosis
This condition is life-threatening. However, drug
treatments can be helpful, and surgical treatments cansuccessfully drain the trapped fluid, though it may reac-cumulate. Some risk of death exists with surgical
drainage of the accumulated fluid.

Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR)
Definition
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a procedure
to support and maintain breathing and circulation for a

"person who has stopped breathing (respiratory arrest)
and/or whose heart has stopped (cardiac arrest).
Purpose
CPR is performed to restore and maintain breathing
and circulation and to provide oxygen and blood flow tothe heart, brain, and other vital organs. CPR should beperformed if a person is unconscious and not breathing.Respiratory and cardiac arrest can be caused by allergicreactions, an ineffective heartbeat, asphyxiation, breath-ing passages that are blocked, choking , drowning, drug
reactions or overdoses, electric shock, exposure to cold,severe shock, or trauma. CPR can be performed bytrained bystanders or healthcare professionals on infants,children, and adults. It should always be performed bythe person on the scene who is most experienced in CPR.
Precautions
CPR should never be performed on a healthy person
because it can cause serious injury to a beating heart byinterfering with normal heartbeats.
Description
CPR is part of the emergency cardiac care system"
"Description
CPR is part of the emergency cardiac care system
designed to save lives. Many deaths can be prevented byprompt recognition of the problem and notification of theemergency medical system (EMS), followed by earlyCPR, defibrillation (which delivers a brief electric
shock to the heart in attempt to get the heart to beat nor-mally), and advanced cardiac life support measures.
CPR must be performed within four to six minutes
after cessation of breathing so as to prevent brain damageor death . It is a two-part procedure that involves rescue"
"breathing and external chest compressions. To provideoxygen to a person’s lungs, the rescuer administers mouth-to-mouth breaths, then helps circulate blood through theheart to vital organs by external chest compressions.Mouth-to-mouth breathing and external chest compressionshould be performed together, but if the rescuer is notstrong enough to do both, the external chest compressionsshould be done. This is more effective than no resuscita-tion attempt, as is CPR that is performed “poorly.”
When performed by a bystander, CPR is designed to
support and maintain breathing and circulation untilemergency medical personnel arrive and take over. Whenperformed by healthcare personnel, it is used in conjunc-tion with other basic and advanced life support measures.
According to the American Heart Association, early
CPR and defibrillation combined with early advancedemergency care can increase survival rates for peoplewith a type of abnormal heart beat called ventricular"
"fibrillation by as much as 40%. CPR by bystanders may
prolong life during deadly ventricular fibrillation, givingemergency medical service personnel time to arrive.
However, many CPR attempts are not ultimately
successful in restoring a person to a good quality of life.Often, there is brain damage even if the heart starts beat-ing again. CPR is therefore not generally recommendedfor the chronically or terminally ill or frail elderly. Forthese people, it represents a traumatic and not a peacefulend of life.
Each year, CPR helps save thousands of lives in the"
"Each year, CPR helps save thousands of lives in the
United States. More than five million Americans annual-ly receive training in CPR through American Heart Asso-ciation and American Red Cross courses. In addition tocourses taught by instructors, the American Heart Asso-ciation also has an interactive video called Learning Sys-tem, which is available at more than 500 healthcare insti-tutions. Both organizations teach CPR the same way, butuse different terms. These organizations recommend thatfamily members or other people who live with peoplewho are at risk for respiratory or cardiac arrest be trainedin CPR. A hand-held device called a CPR Prompt isavailable to walk people trained in CPR through the pro-cedure, using American Heart Association guidelines.CPR has been practiced for more than 40 years.

"ple, with a few modifications for infants and children toaccount for their smaller size.
PERFORMING CPR ON AN ADULT. The first step is to
call the emergency medical system for help by telephon-ing 911; then to begin CPR, following these steps:
• The rescuer opens a person’s airway by placing the
head face up, with the forehead tilted back and the chinlifted. The rescuer checks again for breathing (three tofive seconds), then begins rescue breathing (mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration), pinching the nostrils shutwhile holding the chin in the other hand. The rescuer’smouth is placed against the unconscious person’smouth with the lips making a tight seal, then gentlyexhales for about one to one and a half seconds. Therescuer breaks away for a moment and then repeats.The person’s head is repositioned after each mouth-to-mouth breath.

"• After two breaths, the rescuer checks the unconscious
person’s pulse by moving the hand that was under theperson’s chin to the artery in the neck (carotid artery).If the unconscious person has a heartbeat, the rescuercontinues rescue breathing until help arrives or the per-

"son begins breathing without assistance. If the uncon-
scious person is breathing, the rescuer turns the persononto his or her side.
• If there is no heartbeat, the rescuer performs chest com-
pressions. The rescuer kneels next to the unconsciousperson, placing the heel of one hand in the spot on thelower chest where the two halves of the rib cage cometogether. The rescuer puts one hand on top of the otheron the person’s chest and interlocks the fingers. Thearms are straightened, the rescuer’s shoulders are posi-tioned directly above the hands on the unconscious per-son’s chest. The hands are pressed down, using only thepalms, so that the person’s breastbone sinks in about1.5–2 inches. The rescuer releases pressure withoutremoving the hands, then repeats about 15 times per10–15 second intervals.
• The rescuer tilts the unconscious person’s head and"
"• The rescuer tilts the unconscious person’s head and
returns to rescue breathing for one or two quick breaths.Then breathing and chest compressions are alternatedfor one minute before checking for a pulse. If the res-cuer finds signs of a heartbeat and breathing, CPR isstopped. If the unconscious person is breathing but hasno pulse, the chest compressions are continued. If theunconscious person has a pulse but is not breathing,rescue breathing is continued.
• For children over the age of eight, the rescuer performs
CPR exactly as for an adult.
PERFORMING CPR ON AN INFANT OR CHILD UNDER
THE AGE OF EIGHT. The procedures outlined above are
followed with these differences:
• The rescuer administers CPR for one minute, then calls
for help.
• The rescuer makes a seal around the child’s mouth or
infant’s nose and mouth to give gentle breaths. The res-cuer delivers 20 rescue breaths per minute, taking 1.5–2seconds for each breath.

"• Chest compressions are given with only one hand for a
child and with two or three fingers for an infant. Thebreastbone is depressed only 1–1.5 in (2.5–3.8 cm) fora child and 0.5–1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) for an infant, and therescuer gives at least 100 chest compressions perminute.
New developments in CPR
Some new ways of performing CPR have been tried.
Active compression-decompression resuscitation, ab-dominal compression done in between chest compres-sions, and chest compression using a pneumatic vesthave all been tested but none are currently recommendedfor routine use.The active compression-decompression device was"
"developed to improve blood flow from the heart, but clini-cal studies have found no significant difference in survivalbetween standard and active compression-decompressionCPR. Interposed abdominal counterpulsation, whichrequires two or more rescuers, one compressing the chestand the other compressing the abdomen, was developed toimprove pressure and therefore blood flow. It has beenshown in a small study to improve survival but more datais needed. A pneumatic vest, which circles the chest of anunconscious person and compresses it, increases pressurewithin the chest during external chest compression. Thevest has been shown to improve survival in a preliminarystudy but more data is necessary for a full assessment.

"Preparation
If a person suddenly becomes unconscious, a rescuer
should call out for help from other bystanders, and thendetermine if the unconscious person is responsive bygently shaking the shoulder and shouting a question.Upon receiving no answer, the rescuer should call theemergency medical system.

"Aftercare
Emergency medical care is always necessary after
successful CPR. Once a person’s breathing and heartbeathave been restored, the rescuer should make the personcomfortable and stay there until emergency medical per-sonnel arrive. The rescuer can continue to reassure theperson that help is coming and talk positively until pro-fessionals arrive and take over.
Risks
CPR can cause injury to a person’s ribs, liver, lungs,
and heart. However, these risks must be accepted if CPRis necessary to save the person’s life.
Normal results
In many cases, successful CPR results in restoration
of consciousness and life. Barring other injuries, arevived person usually returns to normal functions withina few hours of being revived.

These include injuries incurred during CPR and lack
of success with CPR. Possible sites for injuries include aperson’s ribs, liver, lungs, and heart. Partially successfulCPR may result in brain damage. Unsuccessful CPRresults in death.

Cardioversion
Definition
Cardioversion refers to the process of restoring the
heart’s normal rhythm by applying a controlled electricshock to the exterior of the chest.
Purpose
When the heart beats too fast, blood no longer circu-
lates effectively in the body. Cardioversion is used tostop this abnormal beating so that the heart can beginnormal rhythm and pump more efficiently.
Precautions
Not all unusual heart rhythms (called arrhythmias )"
"Precautions

"dioversion. Healthcare providers may also try to correct
the heart rhythm with medication or recommend a lifestylechange before trying cardioversion. However, ventricular
tachycardia lasting more than 30 seconds and ventricu-
lar fibrillation require immediate cardioversion.
Description
Elective cardioversion is usually scheduled ahead of
time. After arriving at the hospital, an intravenous (IV)catheter will be placed in the arm and oxygen will begiven through a face mask. A short-acting general anes-thetic will be administered through the vein. During thetwo or three minutes of anesthesia, the doctor will applytwo paddles to the exterior of the chest and administerthe electric shock. It may be necessary to give the shocktwo or three times to obtain normal rhythm.
Preparation
Medication to thin the blood is usually given for at
least three weeks before elective cardioversion. Foodintake should be stopped eight hours before the procedure.

"Aftercare
Medical personnel will monitor the heart rhythm for
a few hours, after which the patient is usually sent home.It is advisable to arrange for transportation home,because drowsiness may last several hours. The doctormay prescribe anti-arrhythmic medication to prevent theabnormal rhythm from returning.

"Carotid sinus massage
Definition
Carotid sinus massage involves rubbing the large
part of the arterial wall at the point where the commoncarotid artery, located in the neck, divides into its twomain branches.
Purpose
Sinus, in this case, means an area in a blood vessel
that is bigger than the rest of the vessel. This is a normaldilation of the vessel. Located in the neck just below theangle of the jaw, the carotid sinus sits above the pointwhere the carotid artery divides into its two main branch-es. Rubbing the carotid sinus stimulates an area in theartery wall that contains nerve endings. These nervesrespond to changes in blood pressure and are capable ofslowing the heart rate. The response to this simple proce-dure often slows a rapid heart rate (for example, atrial

diagnostic information to the physician.
Description
The patient will be asked to lie down, with the neck
fully extended and the head turned away from the sidebeing massaged. While watching an electrocardiogrammonitor, the doctor will gently touch the carotid sinus. Ifthere is no change in the heart rate on the monitor, thepressure is applied more firmly with a gentle rotatingmotion. After massaging one side of the neck, the mas-sage will be repeated on the other side. Both sides of theneck are never massaged at the same time.
Preparation
No special preparation is needed for carotid sinus
massage.
Aftercare
No aftercare is required.
Risks

Carpal tunnel syndrome
Definition
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a disorder caused by
compression at the wrist of the median nerve supplyingthe hand, causing numbness and tingling .
Description
The carpal tunnel is an area in the wrist where the
bones and ligaments create a small passageway for themedian nerve. The median nerve is responsible for bothsensation and movement in the hand, in particular thethumb and first three fingers. When the median nerve iscompressed, an individual’s hand will feel as if it has“gone to sleep.”
Women between the ages of 30 and 60 have the
highest rates of carpal tunnel syndrome. Research hasdemonstrated that carpal tunnel syndrome is a very sig-nificant cause of missed work days due to pain . In 1995,
about $270 million was spent on sick days taken for painfrom repetitive motion injuries.

"Causes and symptoms
Compression of the median nerve in the wrist can
occur during a number of different conditions, particular-ly those conditions which lead to changes in fluid accu-mulation throughout the body. Because the area of thewrist through which the median nerve passes is very nar-row, any swelling in the area will lead to pressure on themedian nerve. This pressure will ultimately interferewith the nerve’s ability to function normally. Pregnancy ,
obesity , arthritis, certain thyroid conditions, diabetes,
and certain pituitary abnormalities all predispose tocarpal tunnel syndrome. Other conditions which increasethe risk for carpal tunnel syndrome include some forms

"of arthritis and various injuries to the arm and wrist
(including fractures , sprains, and dislocations). Further-
more, activities which cause an individual to repeatedlybend the wrist inward toward the forearm can predisposeto carpal tunnel syndrome. Certain jobs which requirerepeated strong wrist motions carry a relatively high riskof carpal tunnel syndrome. Injuries of this type arereferred to as “repetitive motion” injuries, and are morefrequent among secretaries doing a lot of typing, peopleworking at computer keyboards or cash registers, factoryworkers, and some musicians.
Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numb-"
"Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numb-
ness, burning, tingling, and a prickly pin-like sensationover the palm surface of the hand, and into the thumb,forefinger, middle finger, and half of the ring finger.Some individuals notice a shooting pain which goes fromthe wrist up the arm, or down into the hand and fingers.With continued median nerve compression, an individualmay begin to experience muscle weakness, making it dif-ficult to open jars and hold objects with the affected
hand. Eventually, the muscles of the hand served by themedian nerve may begin to grow noticeably smaller(atrophy), especially the fleshy part of the thumb.Untreated, carpal tunnel syndrome may eventually resultin permanent weakness, loss of sensation, or even paral-
ysisof the thumb and fingers of the affected hand.

"Diagnosis
The diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is made in
part by checking to see whether the patient’s symptomscan be brought on by holding his or her hand in positionwith wrist bent for about a minute. Wrist x rays are oftentaken to rule out the possibility of a tumor causing pres-sure on the median nerve. A physician examining a patientsuspected of having carpal tunnel syndrome will perform avariety of simple tests to measure muscle strength and sen-sation in the affected hand and arm. Further testing mightinclude electromyographic or nerve conduction velocitytesting to determine the exact severity of nerve damage.These tests involve stimulating the median nerve withelectricity and measuring the resulting speed and strengthof the muscle response, as well as recording speed ofnerve transmission across the carpel tunnel.
Treatment

"Treatment
Carpal tunnel syndrome is initially treated with
splints, which support the wrist and prevent it from flex-ing inward into the position which exacerbates mediannerve compression. Some people get significant relief bywearing such splints to sleep at night, while others willneed to wear the splints all day, especially if they are per-forming jobs which stress the wrist. Ibuprofen or other
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be pre-
scribed to decrease pain and swelling. When carpal tun-nel syndrome is more advanced, injection of steroids intothe wrist to decrease inflammation may be necessary.

"The most severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome
may require surgery to decrease the compression of themedian nerve and restore its normal function. Such arepair involves cutting that ligament which crosses thewrist, thus allowing the median nerve more room anddecreasing compression. This surgery is done almostexclusively on an outpatient basis and is often performedwithout the patient having to be made unconscious. Care-ful injection of numbing medicines (local anesthesia) ornerve blocks (the injection of anesthetics directly into thenerve) create sufficient numbness to allow the surgery tobe performed painlessly, without the risks associated withgeneral anesthesia. Recovery from this type of surgery isusually quick and without complications.

"Prognosis
Without treatment, continued pressure on the medi-
an nerve puts an individual at risk for permanent disabili-ty in the affected hand. Most people are able to controlthe symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome with splintingand anti-inflammatory agents. For those who go on torequire surgery, about 95% will have complete cessationof symptoms.
Prevention
Prevention is generally aimed at becoming aware of
the repetitive motions which one must make which couldput the wrist into a bent position. People who must worklong hours at a computer keyboard, for example, may needto take advantage of recent advances in “ergonomics,”which try to position the keyboard and computer compo-nents in a way that increases efficiency and decreasesstress. Early use of a splint may also be helpful for peoplewhose jobs increase the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.

"caused by the Bartonella henselae bacterium, which is
found in cats around the world and is transmitted fromcat to cat by fleas. Researchers have discovered that largenumbers of North American cats carry antibodies for thedisease (meaning that the cats have been infected at somepoint in their lives). Some parts of North America havemuch higher rates of cat infection than others, however.Bartonella henselae is uncommon or absent in cold cli-
mates, which fleas have difficulty tolerating, but preva-lent in warm, humid places such as Memphis, Tennessee,where antibodies were found in 71% of the cats tested.The bacterium, which remains in a cat’s bloodstream forseveral months after infection, seems to be harmless tomost cats, and normally an infected cat will not displayany symptoms. Kittens (cats less than one year old) aremore likely than adult cats to be carrying the infection.

"Bartonella henselae can infect people who are

One studyestimated that for every 100,000 Americans there areonly 2.5 cases of cat-scratch disease each year (2.5/100,000). It is also unusual for more than one familymember to become ill; a Florida investigation discoveredmultiple cases in only 3.5% of the families studied. Chil-dren and teenagers appear to be the most likely victimsof cat-scratch disease, although the possibility exists that

"the disease may be more common among adults than pre-
viously thought.
Causes and symptoms
The first sign of cat-scratch disease may be a small
blister at the site of a scratch or bite three to 10 days afterinjury. The blister (which sometimes contains pus) oftenlooks like an insect bite and is usually found on the hands,arms, or head. Within two weeks of the blister’s appear-ance, lymph nodes near the site of injury become swollen.Often the infected person develops a fever or experiencesfatigue or headaches. The symptoms usually disappear
within a month, although the lymph nodes may remainswollen for several months. Hepatitis, pneumonia , and
other dangerous complications can arise, but the likelihoodof cat-scratch disease posing a serious threat to health isvery small. AIDS patients and other immunocompromised
people face the greatest risk of dangerous complications.

Certain common-sense precautions can be taken to
guard against the disease. Scratches and bites should bewashed immediately with soap and water, and it is nevera good idea to rub one’s eyes after handling a cat withoutfirst washing one’s hands. Children should be told not toplay with stray cats or make cats angry. Immunocompro-mised people should avoid owning kittens, which aremore likely than adult cats to be infectious. Because cat-scratch disease is usually not a life-threatening illnessand people tend to form strong emotional bonds withtheir cats, doctors do not recommend getting rid of a catsuspected of carrying the disease.

Cataract surgery
Definition
Cataract surgery is a procedure performed to remove
a cloudy lens from the eye; usually an intraocular lens isimplanted at the same time.
Purpose
The purpose of cataract surgery is to restore clear
vision. It is indicated when cloudy vision due tocataracts has progressed to such an extent that it inter-
feres with normal daily activities.
Precautions
Cataract surgery is not performed on both eyes at
once. To avoid risking blindness in both eyes in theevent of infection or other catastrophe, the first eye isallowed to heal before the cataract is removed from thesecond eye.
The presence of cataracts can mask additional eye"
"The presence of cataracts can mask additional eye
problems, such as retinal damage, that neither doctorsnor patients are aware of prior to surgery. Since suchconditions will continue to impair sight after cataractremoval if they are not identified and treated, the eventu-al outcome of cataract surgery will depend on the out-come of other problems.
In 1997 and 1998, evidence that cataract surgery can
contribute to the progression of age-related macular
degeneration (ARMD) was published. ARMD is the
degeneration of the central part of the retina. According-ly, ARMD patients with cataracts must weigh the risks ofthe loss of central vision, within four or five years,against short-term improvement. When an ARMDpatient chooses cataract surgery, the surgeon shouldshield the retina against bright light to protect it frompossible light-induced damage during surgery and installan intraocular lens capable of absorbing ultraviolet andblue light, which seem to do the most damage.KEY TERMS"
"Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) —
Degeneration of the macula (the central part of theretina where the rods and cones are most dense)that leads to loss of central vision in people over 60.
Cataract —Progressive opacity or clouding of an
eye lens, which obstructs the passage of light tothe retina.
Cornea —Clear outer covering of the front of the eye.
Intraocular lens —Lens made of silicone or plastic
placed within the eye; can be corrective.

which contains light receptors, the rods and cones.

"Description
There are two types of cataract surgery: intracapsular
and extracapsular. Intracapsular surgery is the removal ofboth the lens and the thin capsule that surround them.This type of surgery was common before 1980, but hassince been displaced by extracapsular surgery. Removalof the capsule requires a large incision and doesn’t allowcomfortable intraocular lens implantation. Thus, peoplewho undergo intracapsular cataract surgery have longrecovery periods and have to wear very thick glasses.
Extracapsular cataract surgery is the removal of
the lens where the capsule is left in place. Each year inthe United States, over a million cataracts are removedthis way.
There are two methods for extracapsular cataract"
"There are two methods for extracapsular cataract
surgery. The usual technique is phacoemulsification. Atiny incision (about 0.12 in or 3 mm long) is made nextto the cornea (the eye’s outer covering), and an ultrasonicprobe is used to break the cataract into minute pieces,which are then removed by suction. When the lens is toohard to be emulsified ultrasonically, the surgeon will usea different extracapsular technique requiring a largerincision. An incision about 0.37 in (9 mm) long is made,and the whole lens (without its capsule) is removedthrough the incision. Both kinds of extracapsular extrac-tion leave the back of the capsule intact, so a silicone orplastic intraocular lens can be stably implanted in aboutthe same location as the original lens.
The surgery takes about 30–60 minutes per eye.

"retina (the innermost layer of the eye, containing the light
receptors) is intact and also to measure eye curvature sothat a lens with the proper correction can be implanted.The patient will also have a pre-operative physical exam-
ination . In addition, patients start a course of antibiotic
eye drops or ointment the day before surgery.
Aftercare
Proper post-operative care is especially important after
cataract surgery. Patients will need someone to drive themhome after the surgery and should not bend over or do any-thing strenuous for about two weeks. They should refrainfrom rubbing the eye, should wear glasses to protect theireye, and should wear a shield while sleeping so the eyewon’t be rubbed or bumped accidentally. The patient willusually continue their antibiotic for two to three weeks andwill also take anti-inflammatory medication for about thesame length of time. If the patient experiences inflamma-tion, redness, or pain, they should seek immediate medical"
"treatment to avoid serious complications.
Risks
Cataract surgery itself is quite safe; over 90% of the
time, there are no complications. Possible complicationsinclude intraocular infection (endophthalmitis), central
retinal inflammation (macular edema ), post-operative
glaucoma ,retinal detachment , bleeding under the reti-

Normal results
Ordinarily, patients experience improved visual acu-
ity and improved perception of the vividness of colors,leading to increased abilities in many activities, includingreading, needlework, driving, golf, and tennis, for exam-ple. In addition, sometimes implanted corrective lenseseliminate the need for eyeglasses or contact lenses.

Cataracts
Definition
A cataract is a cloudiness or opacity in the normally
transparent crystalline lens of the eye. This cloudinesscan cause a decrease in vision and may lead to eventualblindness.
Description
The human eye has several parts. The outer layer of"
"the eyeball consists of a transparent dome-shaped corneaand an opaque, white sclera. The cornea and sclera helpprotect the eye. The next layer includes the iris, pupil, andciliary body. The iris is the colored part of the eye and thepupil is the small dark round hole in the middle of the iris.The pupil and iris allow light into the eye. The ciliary bodycontains muscles that help in the eye’s focusing ability.The lens lies behind the pupil and iris. It is covered by acellophane-like capsule. The lens is normally transparent,elliptical in shape, and somewhat elastic. This elasticityallows the lens to focus on both near and far objects. Thelens is attached to the ciliary body by fibers (zonules ofZinn). Muscles in the ciliary body act on the zonules,which then change the shape of the lens. This process iscalled accommodation—the lens focuses images to helpmake vision clear. As people age, the lens hardens andchanges shape less easily. As a result, the accommodationprocess becomes more"
"the lens hardens andchanges shape less easily. As a result, the accommodationprocess becomes more difficult, making it harder to seethings up close. This generally occurs around the age of 40and continues until about age 65. The condition is calledpresbyopia . It is a normal condition of aging , generally"
"resulting in the need for reading glasses.
The lens is made up of approximately 35% protein
and 65% water. As people age, degenerative changes inthe lens’ proteins occur. Changes in the proteins, watercontent, enzymes, and other chemicals are some of thereasons for the formation of a cataract.
The major areas of the lens are the nucleus, the cor-
tex, and the capsule. The nucleus is in the center of thelens, the cortex surrounds the nucleus, and the capsule isthe outer layer. Opacities can occur in any area of thelens. Cataracts, then, can be classified according to loca-tion (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapular cataracts).The density and location of the cataract determines theamount of vision affected. If the cataract forms in the areaof the lens directly behind the pupil, vision may be signif-icantly impaired. A cataract that occurs on the outer edgesor side of the lens will create less of a visual problem.

"Cataracts in the elderly are so common that they are
thought to be a normal part of the aging process.Between the ages of 52 and 64, there is a 50% chance ofhaving a cataract, while at least 70% of those 70 andolder are affected. Cataracts associated with aging (senileor age-related cataracts) most often occur in both eyes,with each cataract progressing at a different rate. Initial-ly, cataracts may not affect vision. If the cataract remainssmall or at the periphery of the lens, the visual changesmay be minor.
Cataracts that occur in people other than the elderly
are much less common. Congenital cataracts occur veryrarely in newborns. Genetic defects or an infection ordisease in the mother during pregnancy are among the"
"causes of congenital cataracts. Traumatic cataracts maydevelop after a foreign body or trauma injures the lens oreye. Systemic illnesses, such as diabetes, may result incataracts. Cataracts can also occur secondary to other eyediseases—for example, an inflammation of the innerlayer of the eye ( uveitis ) or glaucoma . Such cataracts are
called complicated cataracts. Toxic cataracts result fromchemical toxicity, such as steroid use. Cataracts can alsoresult from exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays.
Causes and symptoms
Recent studies have been conducted to try to deter-
mine whether diet or the use of vitamins might have an"
"mine whether diet or the use of vitamins might have an
effect on the formation of cataracts in older people. Theresults have been mixed, with some studies finding thatthere is a connection and other studies finding none.Much interest has been focused on the use of antioxidantsupplements as a protection against cataracts. Antioxidantvitamins such as vitamins A, C, E and beta-carotene helpthe body clean-up oxygen-free radicals. Some vitaminsare marketed specifically for the eyes. Patients shouldspeak to their doctors about the use of such vitamins.
Smoking and alcohol intake have been implicated in
cataract formation. Some studies have determined that adiet high in fat will increase the likelihood of cataractformation, while an increase in foods rich in antioxidantswill reduce the incidence. More research is needed todetermine if diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, or vita-mins have any connection to the formation of cataracts."

"There are several common symptoms of cataracts:
• gradual, painless onset of blurry, filmy, or fuzzy vision
• poor central vision• frequent changes in eyeglass prescription• changes in color vision• increased glare from lights, especially oncoming head-
lights when driving at night
• “second sight” improvement in near vision (no longer
needing reading glasses), but a decrease in distancevision
• poor vision in sunlight• presence of a milky whiteness in the pupil as the
cataract progresses.
Diagnosis
Both ophthalmologists and optometrists may detect
and monitor cataract growth and prescribe prescriptionlenses for visual deficits. However, only an ophthalmolo-gist can perform cataract extraction.
Cataracts are easily diagnosed from the reporting of"
"Cataracts are easily diagnosed from the reporting of
symptoms, a visual acuity exam using an eye chart, andby examination of the eye itself. Shining a penlight intothe pupil may reveal opacities or a color change of thelens even before visual symptoms have developed. Aninstrument called a slit lamp is basically a large micro-scope. This lets the doctor examine the front of the eyeand the lens. The slit lamp helps the doctor determine thelocation of the cataract.
Some other diagnostic tests may be used to deter-
mine if cataracts are present or how well the patient maypotentially see after surgery. These include a glare test,potential vision test, and contrast sensitivity test.Treatment

"For cataracts that cause no symptoms or only minor
visual changes, no treatment may be necessary. Continuedmonitoring and assessment of the cataract is needed by anophthalmologist or optometrist at scheduled office visits.Increased strength in prescription eyeglasses or contactlenses may be helpful. This may be all that is required ifthe cataract does not reduce the patient’s quality of life.
Cataract surgery—the only option for patients whose"
"cataracts interfere with vision to the extent of affectingtheir daily lives—is the most frequently performed surgeryin the United States. It generally improves vision in over90% of patients. Some people have heard that a cataractshould be “ripe” before being removed. A “ripe” or maturecataract is when the lens is completely opaque. Mostcataracts are removed before they reach that stage. Some-times cataracts need to be removed so that the doctor canexamine the back of the eye more carefully. This is impor-tant in patients with diseases that may affect the eye. Ifcataracts are present in both eyes, only one eye at a timeshould be operated on. Healing occurs in the first eyebefore the second cataract is removed, sometimes as earlyas the following week. A final eyeglass prescription is usu-ally given about four to six weeks after surgery. Patientswill still need reading glasses. The overall health of thepatient needs to be considered in making the decision tooperate. However, age alone"
"health of thepatient needs to be considered in making the decision tooperate. However, age alone need not preclude effectivesurgical treatment of cataracts. People in their 90s canhave successful return of vision after cataract surgery ."
"Surgery to remove cataracts is generally an outpa-
tient procedure. A local anesthetic is used and the proce-dure lasts about an hour. Removal of the cloudy lens canbe done by several different procedures. The three typesof cataract surgery available are:
• Extracapsular cataract extraction. This type of cataract
extraction is the most common. The lens and the frontportion of the capsule are removed. The back part of thecapsule remains, providing strength to the eye.
• Intracapsular cataract extraction. The lens and the
entire capsule are removed. This method carries anincreased risk for detachment of the retina and swellingafter surgery. It is rarely used.
• Phacoemulsification. This type of extracapsular extrac-
tion needs a very small incision, resulting in faster heal-ing. Ultrasonic vibration is applied to the lens to breakit up into very small pieces which are then aspirated outof the eye with suction by the ophthalmologist.

"method is used, an IOL may be clipped onto the iris.
Contact lenses and cataract glasses (aphakic lenses) areprescribed if an IOL was not inserted. A folding IOL isused when phacoemulsification is performed to accom-modate the small incision.
Antibiotic drops to prevent infection and steroids to
reduce inflammation are prescribed after surgery. An eyeshield or glasses during the day will protect the eye frominjury while it heals. During the night, an eye shield isworn. The patient returns to the doctor the day aftersurgery for assessment, with several follow-up visits overthe next two months to monitor the healing process.
Prognosis
The success rate of cataract extraction is very high,"
"Prognosis
The success rate of cataract extraction is very high,
with a good prognosis. A visual acuity of 20/40 or bettermay be achieved. If an extracapsular cataract extractionwas performed, a secondary cataract may develop in theremaining back portion of the capsule. This can occur oneto two years after surgery. YAG capsulotomy is most oftenused for this type of cataract. YAG stands for yttrium alu-minum garnet, the name of the laser used for this proce-dure. This is a painless outpatient procedure and requiresno incision. The laser beam makes a small opening in theremaining back part of the capsule, allowing light through.
In a very small percentage (3–5%) of surgical cataract
extractions, complications occur. Infections, swelling ofthe cornea ( edema ), bleeding, retinal detachment , and"
"the onset of glaucoma have been reported. Some problemsmay occur one to two days, or even several weeks, aftersurgery. Any haziness, redness, decrease in vision, nausea,or pain should be reported to the surgeon immediately.
Prevention
Preventive measures emphasize protecting the eyes
from UV radiation by wearing glasses with a special coatingto protect against UV rays. Dark lenses alone are not suffi-cient. The lenses must protect against UV light (specifically,UV-A and UV-B). Antioxidants may also provide some pro-tection by reducing free radicals that can damage lens pro-teins. A healthy diet rich in sources of antioxidants, includ-ing citrus fruits, sweet potatoes, carrots, green leafy vegeta-bles, and/or vitamin supplements may be helpful. When tak-ing certain medications, such as steroids, more frequent eyeexams may be necessary. Patients should speak to their doc-tors to see if medications may affect their eyes.

him/her motionless. Catatonic excitement, or excessivemovement, is associated with violent behavior directedtoward oneself or others.
Features of catatonia may also be seen in Neuroleptic
Malignant Syndrome (NMS) which is an uncommon (butpotentially lethal) reaction to some medications used totreat major mental illnesses. NMS is considered a medicalemergency since 25% of untreated cases result in death .
Catatonia can also be present in individuals sufferingfrom a number of other physical and emotional conditionssuch as drug intoxication, depression, and schizophrenia .
It is most commonly associated with mood disorders .

"Description
In catatonic stupor, motor activity may be reduced to
zero. Individuals avoid bathing and grooming, make littleor no eye contact with others, may be mute and rigid, andinitiate no social behaviors. In catatonic excitement theindividual is extremely hyperactive although the activityseems to have no purpose. Violence toward him/herselfor others may also be seen.
NMS is observed as a dangerous side effect associat-
ed with certain neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs such ashaloperidol (Haldol). It comes on suddenly and is char-acterized by stiffening of the muscles, fever , confusion
and heavy sweating.
Catatonia can also be categorized as intrinsic or
extrinsic. If the condition has an identifiable cause, it isdesignated as extrinsic. If no cause can be determinedfollowing physical examination , laboratory testing, and
history taking, the illness is considered to be intrinsic.

Repetitive odd movements ofthe fingers or hands, as well as imitating the speech ormovements of others also may indicate that catatonia is pre-sent. There are no laboratory or other tests that can be usedto positively diagnose this condition, but medical and neuro-logical tests are necessary to rule out underlying lesions ordisorders that may be causing the symptoms observed.

do not respond to medication. If these approaches areunsuccessful, treatment will be redirected to attempts tocontrol the signs and symptoms of the illness.
Prognosis
Catatonia usually responds quickly to medication
interventions.
Prevention
There is currently no known way to prevent catatonia
because the cause has not yet been identified. Researchefforts continue to explore possible origins. Avoidingexcessive use of neuroleptic drugs can help minimize therisk of developing catatonic-like symptoms.

"Catecholamines tests
Definition
Catecholamines is a collective term for the hormones
epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Manufac-tured chiefly by the chromaffin cells of the adrenalglands, these hormones are involved in readying the bodyfor the “fight-or-flight” response (also known as the alarmreaction). When these hormones are released, the heartbeats stronger and faster, blood pressure rises, more bloodflows to the brain and muscles, the liver releases stores ofenergy as a sugar the body can readily use (glucose), therate of breathing increases and airways widen, and diges-tive activity slows. These reactions direct more oxygenand fuel to the organs most active in responding tostress—mainly the brain, heart, and skeletal muscles.

"Purpose
Pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the chromaffin
cells of the adrenal gland) and tumors of the nervous sys-tem (neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and gan-glioneuromas) that affect hormone production can causeexcessive levels of different catecholamines to be secret-ed. This results in constant or intermittent high bloodpressure ( hypertension ). Episodes of high blood pres-
sure may be accompanied by symptoms such asheadache , sweating, palpitations , and anxiety . The cat-
echolamines test can be ordered, then, to determine ifhigh blood pressure and other symptoms are related toimproper hormone secretion and to identify the type oftumor causing elevated catecholamine levels.
Description

"Description
The catecholamines test can be performed on either
blood or urine. If performed on blood, the test mayrequire one or two samples, depending on the physician’srequest. The first blood sample will be drawn after thepatient has been lying down in a warm, comfortableenvironment for at least 30 minutes. If a second sample isneeded, the patient will be asked to stand for 10 minutesbefore the blood is drawn. Instead of a venipuncture,which can be stressful for the patient, possibly increasingcatecholamine levels in the blood, a plastic or rubbertube-like device called a catheter may be used to collectthe blood samples. The catheter would be inserted in avein 24 hours in advance, eliminating the need for needlepunctures at the time of the test.
It may take up to a week for a lab to complete testing
of the samples. Because blood levels of catecholaminescommonly go up and down in response to such factors astemperature, stress , postural change, diet, smoking ,obe-"
"sity, and many drugs, abnormally high blood test results
should be confirmed with a 24-hour urine test. In addition,catecholamine secretion from a tumor may not be steady,but may occur periodically during the day, and potentiallycould be missed when blood testing is used. The urine testprovides the laboratory with a specimen that reflects cate-cholamine production over an entire 24-hour period. Ifurine is tested, the patient or a healthcare worker must col-lect all the urine passed over the 24-hour period.

"Preparation
It is important that the patient refrain from using cer-
tain medications, especially cold or allergy remedies, fortwo weeks before the test. Certain foods—includingbananas, avocados, cheese, coffee, tea, cocoa, beer,licorice, citrus fruit, vanilla, and Chianti—must be avoid-ed for 48 hours prior to testing. However, people shouldbe sure to get adequate amounts of vitamin C before thetest, because this vitamin is necessary for catecholamineformation. The patient should be fasting (nothing to eat
or drink) for 10 to 24 hours before the blood test andshould not smoke for 24 hours beforehand. Some labora-tories may call for additional restrictions. As much aspossible, the patient should try to avoid excessive physi-

"cal exercise and emotional stress before the test, because
either may alter test results by causing increased secre-tion of epinephrine and norepinephrine.
Patients collecting their own 24-hour urine samples
will be given a container with special instructions. Theurine samples must be refrigerated.
Risks
Risks for the blood test are minimal, but may
include slight bleeding from the venipuncture site, faint-
ingor feeling lightheaded after blood is drawn, or blood
accumulating under the puncture site (hematoma). Thereare no risks for the urine test.

ing to methodology of testing, and differ between bloodand urine samples. If testing is done by the method calledHigh Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), typi-cal values for blood and urine follow.KEY TERMS

Catheter ablation
Definition
Catheter ablation of an irregular heartbeat involves
having a tube (a catheter) inserted into the heart through
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 678Catheter ablationGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 678"
"which electrical energy is sent to either reset the heart-
beat or stop the heart from beating so a mechanical pace-maker can be put in place.
Purpose
Irregular heartbeats can occur in healthy people
without causing any dangerous symptoms or requiringmedical attention. Slight changes in the normal patternsof heartbeats often reset themselves without notice.
But when the heartbeat is greatly disrupted—either
because of traumatic injury, disease, hypertension ,
surgery, or reduced blood flow to the heart caused byblockages in the blood vessels that nourish the heart—the condition must be recognized and treated immediate-ly. Otherwise, it can be fatal.
Various drugs can be used to control and help reset
these abnormal heart rhythms ( arrhythmias ). The tech-nique of catheter ablation (meaning tube-guided removal)
is used to interrupt the abnormal contractions in the heart,allowing normal heart beating to resume. Atrial fibrilla-
tion and flutter and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome"
"tion and flutter and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
are two of the most common disorders treated withcatheter ablation.
Precautions
The improper correction of abnormal heartbeats can
cause additional arrhythmias and can be fatal. Abnormali-ties in different areas of the heart cause different types ofirregular heartbeats; the type of arrhythmia must be clear-ly defined before this procedure can be properly done.

This heat is absorbed by the heart tissue, causing asmall localized burn and destroying the tissue in contactwith the catheter tip; in this way, small regions of hearttissue are burned in a controlled manner. This controlleddestruction of small sections of heart muscle actuallykills the nerve cells causing the irregular heartbeat, stop-ping the nerve signals that are passing through this sec-tion of the heart. This usually causes the irregular heart-beat to be reset into a normal heartbeat.

"Preparation
People can undergo this procedure by having gener-
al anesthesia or by taking medicines to make themrelaxed and sleepy (sedatives) along with painkillers.Once the type of irregular heartbeat is identified andthese medicines are given, the catheter is insertedthrough a blood vessel and into the heart. Importantly,correct placement of the catheter is visualized by using aspecialized type of x-ray machine called a fluoroscope.
Aftercare
Being sure the patient is comfortable during and
after this procedure is very important. However, becauseeach person may have a different arrhythmia and possi-bly other medical problems as well, each patient’s needsmust be evaluated individually.KEY TERMS

"Pacemaker —An electrical device that has elec-
trodes attached to the heart to electrically stimu-late the heart to beat normally. Pacemakers can beinternal (placed under the skin) or external, withthe electrodes placed on the skin or threadedthrough a tube placed into the heart.Risks
Overall, fewer than 5% of people having this proce-
dure experience complications. The most common com-plications are usually related to blood vessel injury whenthe catheter is inserted and to different heart-relatedproblems due to the moving of the catheter within theheart. However, in general, this technique is safe and cancontrol many different heart arrhythmias.
Normal results
Depending upon the type of irregular heartbeat
being treated, either the normal heartbeat resumes aftertreatment or the ability of the heart to beat on its own islost, requiring the insertion of a pacemaker to stimulatethe heart to beat regularly.

"Abnormal results
Additional irregular heartbeats can occur as a result
of this procedure, as can damage to the blood vessels thatfeed the heart. Because this procedure requires the use ofthe x-ray machine called a fluoroscope, there is exposureto x-ray radiation, but it’s doubtful that this is harmful inadult patients. The risk versus benefit is considered withpediatric patients.

Celiac disease
Definition
Celiac disease is a disease of the digestive system
that damages the small intestine and interferes with theabsorption of nutrients from food.
Description
Celiac disease occurs when the body reacts abnor-"
"Description
Celiac disease occurs when the body reacts abnor-
mally to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, barley, andpossibly oats. When someone with celiac disease eatsfoods containing gluten, that person’s immune systemcauses an inflammatory response in the small intestine,which damages the tissues and results in impaired abilityto absorb nutrients from foods. The inflammation andmalabsorption create wide-ranging problems in manysystems of the body. Since the body’s own immune sys-tem causes the damage, celiac disease is classified as an“autoimmune” disorder. Celiac disease may also be calledsprue, nontropical sprue, gluten sensitive enteropathy,celiac sprue, and adult celiac disease.
Celiac disease may be discovered at any age, from"
"Celiac disease may be discovered at any age, from
infancy through adulthood. The disorder is more com-monly found among white Europeans or in people ofEuropean descent. It is very unusual to find celiac dis-ease in African or Asian people. The exact incidence ofthe disease is uncertain. Estimates vary from one in5000, to as many as one in every 300 individuals withthis background. The prevalence of celiac disease seemsto be different from one European country to another,and between Europe and the United States. This may bedue to differences in diet and/or unrecognized disease. Arecent study of random blood samples tested for celiacdisease in the US showed one in 250 testing positive. It isclearly underdiagnosed, probably due to the symptomsbeing attributed to another problem, or lack of knowl-edge about celiac disease by physicians and laboratories.Because of the known genetic component, relatives ofpatients with celiac disease are considered at higher riskfor the disorder."
"Because celiac disease has a hereditary influence,
close relatives (especially first degree relatives, such aschildren, siblings, and parents) have a higher risk ofbeing affected with the condition. The chance that a firstdegree relative of someone with celiac disease will havethe disease is about 10%.
As more is learned about celiac disease, it becomes
evident that it has many variations which may not pro-duce typical symptoms. It may even be clinically “silent,”where no obvious problems related to the disease areapparent.
Causes and symptoms
Celiac disease can run in families and has a genetic"
"basis, although the pattern of inheritance is complicated.The type of inheritance pattern that celiac disease fol-lows is called multifactorial (caused by many factors,both genetic and environmental). Researchers think thatseveral factors must exist in order for the disease tooccur. The patient must have a genetic predisposition todevelop the disorder. Then, something in their environ-ment acts as a stimulus, or “trigger,” to their immune sys-tem, causing the disease to become active for the firsttime. For conditions with multifactorial inheritance, peo-ple without the genetic predisposition are less likely todevelop the condition with exposure to the same triggers.Or, they may require more exposure to the stimulusbefore developing the disease than someone with agenetic predisposition. Some of the things which mayprovoke a reaction include surgery, especially gastroin-testinal surgery; a change to a low fat diet, which has anincreased number of wheat-based foods; pregnancy ;"
"childbirth ; severe emotional stress ; or a viral infection.
This combination of genetic susceptibility and an outsideagent leads to celiac disease.
Each person with celiac disease is affected different-
ly. When food containing gluten reaches the small intes-tine, the immune system begins to attack a substancecalled gliadin, which is found in the gluten. The resultinginflammation causes damage to the delicate finger-likestructures in the intestine, called villi, where food absorp-tion actually takes place. The patient may experience anumber of symptoms related to the inflammation and thechemicals it releases, and/or the lack of ability to absorbnutrients from food, which can cause malnutrition .
The most commonly recognized symptoms of celiac
disease relate to the improper absorption of food in thegastrointestinal system. Many patients with gastrointesti-nal symptoms will have diarrhea and fatty, greasy,"
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 681Celiac diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 681
"unusually foul-smelling stools. The patient may com-
plain of excessive gas (flatulence), distended abdomen,weight loss, and generalized weakness. Not all peoplehave digestive system complications; some people onlyhave irritability or depression. Irritability is one of themost common symptoms in children with celiac disease.
Not all patients have these problems. Unrecognized
and therefore untreated celiac disease may cause or con-tribute to a variety of other conditions. The decreasedability to digest, absorb, and utilize food properly (mal-absorption) may cause anemia (low red blood count )
from iron deficiency or easy bruising from a lack of vita-min K. Poor mineral absorption may result in osteoporo-
sis, or “brittle bones,” which may lead to bone fractures .
Vitamin D levels may be insufficient and bring about a“softening” of bones (osteomalacia), which producespain and bony deformities, such as flattening or bending."
"Defects in the tooth enamel, characteristic of celiac dis-ease, may be recognized by dentists. Celiac disease maybe discovered during medical tests performed to investi-gate failure to thrive in infants, or lack of proper growth
in children and adolescents. People with celiac diseasemay also experience lactose intolerance because they
don’t produce enough of the enzyme lactase, whichbreaks down the sugar in milk into a form the body canabsorb. Other symptoms can include muscle cramps,fatigue , delayed growth, tingling or numbness in the legs
(from nerve damage), pale sores in the mouth (calledaphthus ulcers), tooth discoloration, or missed menstrualperiods (due to severe weight loss).
A distinctive, painful skin rash, called dermatitis
herpetiformis, may be the first sign of celiac disease.Approximately 10% of patients with celiac disease havethis rash, but it is estimated that 85% or more of patientswith the rash have the disease.
Many disorders are associated with celiac disease,"
"Many disorders are associated with celiac disease,
though the nature of the connection is unclear. One typeof epilepsy is linked to celiac disease. Once their celiacdisease is successfully treated, a significant number ofthese patients have fewer or no seizures. Patients withalopecia areata, a condition where hair loss occurs in
sharply defined areas, have been shown to have a higherrisk of celiac disease than the general population. Thereappears to be a higher percentage of celiac diseaseamong people with Down syndrome , but the link

"between the conditions is unknown.
Several conditions attributed to a disorder of the
immune system have been associated with celiac disease.People with insulin dependent diabetes (type I) have amuch higher incidence of celiac disease. One source esti-mates that as many as one in 20 insulin-dependent dia-betics may have celiac disease. Patients with other condi-tions where celiac disease may be more commonly foundinclude those with juvenile chronic arthritis, some thy-
roid diseases, and IgA deficiency.
There is an increased risk of intestinal lymphoma, a
type of cancer , in individuals with celiac disease. Suc-
cessful treatment of the celiac disease seems to decreasethe chance of developing lymphoma.
Diagnosis
Because of the variety of ways celiac disease can
manifest itself, it is often not discovered promptly. Itssymptoms are similar to many other conditions includingirritible bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease ,ulcerative
colitis , diverticulosis, intestinal infections, chronic"
"colitis , diverticulosis, intestinal infections, chronic
fatigue syndrome , and depression. The condition may
persist without diagnosis for so long that the patientaccepts a general feeling of illness as normal. This leadsto further delay in identifying and treating the disorder. Itis not unusual for the disease to be identified in thecourse of medical investigations for seemingly unrelatedproblems. For example, celiac disease has been discov-ered during testing to find the cause of infertility .
If celiac disease is suspected, a blood test can be"
"ordered. This test looks for the antibodies to gluten (calledantigliadin, anti-endomysium, and antireticulin) that theimmune system produces in celiac disease. Antibodies arechemicals produced by the immune system in response tosubstances that the body perceives to be threatening. Someexperts advocate not just evaluating patients with symp-toms, but using these blood studies as a screening test forhigh-risk individuals, such as those with relatives (espe-cially first degree relatives) known to have the disorder. Anabnormal result points towards celiac disease, but furthertests are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Because celiacdisease affects the ability of the body to absorb nutrientsfrom food, several tests may be ordered to look for nutri-tional deficiencies. For example, doctors may order a testof iron levels in the blood because low levels of iron (ane-mia) may accompany celiac disease. Doctors may alsoorder a test for fat in the stool, since celiac disease pre-vents the body"
"disease. Doctors may alsoorder a test for fat in the stool, since celiac disease pre-vents the body from absorbing fat from food."
"If these tests above are suspicious for celiac disease,
the next step is a biopsy (removal of a tiny piece of tissuesurgically) of the small intestine. This is usually done by agastroenterologist, a physician who specializes in diagnos-ing and treating bowel disorders. It is generally performedin the office, or in a hospital’s outpatient department. Thepatient remains awake, but is sedated. A narrow tube,called an endoscope, is passed through the mouth, downthrough the stomach, and into the small intestine. A smallsample of tissue is taken and sent to the laboratory foranalysis. If it shows a pattern of tissue damage characteris-tic of celiac disease, the diagnosis is established.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 682Celiac diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 682"
"The patient is then placed on a gluten-free diet
(GFD). The physician will periodically recheck the levelof antibody in the patient’s blood. After several months,the small intestine is biopsied again. If the diagnosis ofceliac disease was correct (and the patient followed therigorous diet), healing of the intestine will be apparent.Most experts agree that it is necessary to follow thesesteps in order to be sure of an accurate diagnosis.
Treatment
The only treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free
diet. This may be easy for the doctor to prescribe, but dif-ficult for the patient to follow. For most people, adheringto this diet will stop symptoms and prevent damage to theintestines. Damaged villi can be functional again in threeto six months. This diet must be followed for life. Forpeople whose symptoms are cured by the gluten-free diet,this is further evidence that their diagnosis is correct.
Gluten is present in any product that contains wheat,"
"Gluten is present in any product that contains wheat,
rye, barley, or oats. It helps make bread rise, and givesmany foods a smooth, pleasing texture. In addition to themany obvious places gluten can be found in a normaldiet, such as breads, cereals, and pasta, there are manyhidden sources of gluten. These include ingredientsadded to foods to improve texture or enhance flavor andproducts used in food packaging. Gluten may even bepresent on surfaces used for food preparation or cooking.
Fresh foods that have not been artificially processed,
such as fruits, vegetables, and meats, are permitted aspart of a GFD. Gluten-free foods can be found in healthfood stores and in some supermarkets. Mail-order foodcompanies often have a selection of gluten-free products.Help in dietary planning is available from dieticians(healthcare professionals specializing in food and nutri-
tion) or from support groups for individuals with celiac"
"tion) or from support groups for individuals with celiac
disease. There are many cookbooks on the market specif-ically for those on a GFD.
Treating celiac disease with a GFD is almost always
completely effective. Gastrointestinal complaints andother symptoms are alleviated. Secondary complications,such as anemia and osteoporosis, resolve in almost allpatients. People who have experienced lactose intoler-ance related to their celiac disease usually see thosesymptoms subside, as well. Although there is no risk andmuch potential benefit to this treatment, it is clear thatavoiding all foods containing gluten can be difficult.
Experts emphasize the need for lifelong adherence to
the GFD to avoid the long-term complications of this dis-order. They point out that although the disease may havesymptom-free periods if the diet is not followed, silentdamage continues to occur. Celiac disease cannot be “out-grown” or cured, according to medical authorities.KEY TERMS"

Prognosis
Patients with celiac disease must adhere to a strict
GFD throughout their lifetime. Once the diet has beenfollowed for several years, individuals with celiac dis-ease have similar mortality rates as the general popula-tion. However, about 10% of people with celiac diseasedevelop a cancer involving the gastrointestinal tract (bothcarcinoma and lymphoma).

"There are a small number of patients who develop a
refractory type of celiac disease, where the GFD nolonger seems effective. Once the diet has been thorough-ly assessed to ensure no hidden sources of gluten arecausing the problem, medications may be prescribed.Steroids or immunosuppressant drugs are often used to
try to control the disease. It is unclear whether theseefforts meet with much success.
Prevention
There is no way to prevent celiac disease. However,
the key to decreasing its impact on overall health is earlydiagnosis and strict adherence to the prescribed gluten-free diet.

Cellulitis
Definition
Cellulitis is a spreading bacterial infection just
below the skin surface. It is most commonly caused byStreptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus .
Description
The word “cellulitis” actually means “inflammation"
"Description
The word “cellulitis” actually means “inflammation
of the cells.” Specifically, cellulitis refers to an infectionof the tissue just below the skin surface. In humans, theskin and the tissues under the skin are the most commonlocations for microbial infection. Skin is the first defenseagainst invading bacteria and other microbes. An infec-tion can occur when this normally strong barrier is dam-aged due to surgery, injury, or a burn. Even something assmall as a scratch or an insect bite allows bacteria to enterthe skin, which may lead to an infection. Usually, theimmune system kills any invading bacteria, but some-times the bacteria are able to grow and cause an infection.
Once past the skin surface, the warmth, moisture, and
nutrients allow bacteria to grow rapidly. Disease-causingbacteria release proteins called enzymes which cause tis-sue damage. The body’s reaction to damage is inflamma-tion which is characterized by pain , redness, heat, and"
"swelling. This red, painful region grows bigger as theinfection and resulting tissue damage spread. An untreat-ed infection may spread to the lymphatic system ( acute
lymphangitis ), the lymph nodes ( lymphadenitis ), the
bloodstream ( bacteremia ), or into deeper tissues. Celluli-
tis most often occurs on the face, neck, and legs.Orbital cellulitis
A very serious infection, called orbital cellulitis,
occurs when bacteria enter and infect the tissues sur-rounding the eye. In 50–70% of all cases of orbital cel-lulitis, the infection spreads to the eye(s) from the sinus-es or the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat). Twen-ty-five percent of orbital infections occur after surgery onthe face. Other sources of orbital infection include adirect infection from an eye injury, from a dental orthroat infection, and through the bloodstream.
Infection of the tissues surrounding the eye causes"
"Infection of the tissues surrounding the eye causes
redness, swollen eyelids, severe pain, and causes the eyeto bulge out. This serious infection can lead to a tempo-rary loss of vision, blindness, brain abscesses, inflamma-tion of the brain and spinal tissues ( meningitis ), and
other complications. Before the discovery of antibiotics ,
orbital cellulitis caused blindness in 20% of patients anddeath in 17% of patients. Antibiotic treatment has signif-
icantly reduced the incidence of blindness and death.
Causes and symptoms
Although other kinds of bacteria can cause cellulitis,
it is most often caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (the
bacteria which causes strep throat ) and Staphylococcus
aureus . Streptococcus pyogenes is the so-called “flesh-"
"aureus . Streptococcus pyogenes is the so-called “flesh-
eating bacteria” and, in rare cases, can cause a danger-ous, deep skin infection called necrotizing fasciitis.Orbital cellulitis may be caused by bacteria which cannotgrow in the presence of oxygen (anaerobic bacteria). Inchildren, Haemophilus influenzae type B frequently
causes orbital cellulitis following a sinus infection.
Streptococcus pyogenes can be picked up from a
person who has strep throat or an infected sore. Othercellulitis-causing bacteria can be acquired from directcontact with infected sores. Persons who are at a higherrisk for cellulitis are those who have a severe underlyingdisease (such as cancer , diabetes, and kidney disease),
are taking steroid medications, have a reduced immunesystem (because of AIDS , organ transplant, etc.), have"
"been burned, have insect bites, have reduced blood circu-lation to limbs, or have had a leg vein removed for coro-nary bypass surgery. In addition, chicken pox, human oranimal bite wounds , skin wounds, and recent surgery
can put a person at a higher risk for cellulitis.
The characteristic symptoms of cellulitis are red-
ness, warmth, pain, and swelling. The infected areaappears as a red patch that gets larger rapidly within thefirst 24 hours. A thick red line which progresses towardsthe heart may appear indicating an infection of the lymphvessels (lymphangitis). Other symptoms which mayoccur include fever , chills, tiredness, muscle aches, and a
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 684CellulitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 684"
"general ill feeling. Some people also experience nausea,
vomiting, stiff joints, and hair loss at the infection site.
The characteristic symptoms of orbital cellulitis are
eye pain, redness, swelling, warmth, and tenderness. Theeye may bulge out and it may be difficult or impossibleto move. Temporary loss of vision, pus drainage from theeye, chills, fever, headaches, vomiting, and a general illfeeling may occur.
Diagnosis
Cellulitis may be diagnosed and treated by a family
doctor, an infectious disease specialist, a doctor who spe-cializes in skin diseases (dermatologist), or in the case oforbital cellulitis, an eye doctor (ophthalmologist). Thediagnosis of cellulitis is based mainly on the patient’ssymptoms. The patient’s recent medical history is alsoused in the diagnosis.

"Laboratory tests may be done to determine which
kind of bacteria is causing the infection but these testsare not always successful. If the skin injury is visible, asterile cotton swab is used to pick up a sample from thewound. If there is no obvious skin injury, a needle maybe used to inject a small amount of sterile salt solutioninto the infected skin, and then the solution is withdrawn.The salt solution should pick up some of the bacteriacausing the infection. A blood sample may be taken fromthe patient’s arm to see if bacteria have entered thebloodstream. Also, a blood test may be done to count thenumber of white blood cells in the blood. High numbersof white blood cells suggest that the body is trying tofight a bacterial infection.
For orbital cellulitis, the doctor may often perform a
special x-ray scan called computed tomography scan"
"special x-ray scan called computed tomography scan
(CT). This scan enables the doctor to see the patient’shead in cross-section to determine exactly where theinfection is and see if any damage has occurred. A CTscan takes about 20 minutes.
Treatment
Antibiotic treatment is the only way to battle this
potentially life-threatening infection. Mild to moderatecellulitis can be treated with the following antibioticstaken every four to eight hours by mouth:
• penicillins (Bicillin, Wycillin, Pen Vee, V-Cillin)• erythromycin (E-Mycin, Ery-Tab)
• cephalexin (Biocef, Keflex)
• cloxacillin (Tegopen)

ized for mild or moderate cellulitis. General treatmentmeasures include elevation of the infected area, rest, andapplication of warm, moist compresses to the infectedarea. The doctor will want to see the patient again tomake sure that the antibiotic treatment is effective instopping the infection.
Persons at high risk for severe cellulitis will proba-
bly be hospitalized for treatment and monitoring. Antibi-otics may be given intravenously to patients with severecellulitis. Complications such as deep infection, or boneor joint infections, might require surgical drainage and alonger course of antibiotic treatment. Extensive tissuedestruction may require plastic surgery to repair. In casesof orbital cellulitis caused by a sinus infection, surgerymay be required to drain the sinuses.

Over 90% of all cellulitis cases are cured after seven to

tis (brain and spinal cord infection), tissue death (necrosis),and/or lymphangitis (infection of the lymph vessels).Severe cellulitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes can
lead to destructive and life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis.

Description
Origins
The theory behind cell therapy has been in existence
for several hundred years. The first recorded discussion ofthe concept of cell therapy can be traced to PhillippusAureolus Paracelsus (1493–1541), a German-Swiss physi-cian and alchemist who wrote in his Der grossen Wun-
dartzney (“Great Surgery Book”) in 1536 that “the heart
heals the heart, lung heals the lung, spleen heals the spleen;like cures like.” Paracelsus and many of his contemporariesagreed that the best way to treat an illness was to use livingtissue to restore the ailing. In 1667, at a laboratory in thepalace of Louis XIV , Jean-Baptiste Denis (1640–1704)attempted to transfuse blood from a calf into a mentally illpatient—and since blood transfusion is, in effect, a form"
"of cell therapy, this could be the first documented case ofthis procedure. However, the first recorded attempt at non-blood cellular therapy occurred in 1912 when Germanphysicians attempted to treat children with hypothy-
roidism , or an underactive thyroid, with thyroid cells.
In 1931, Dr. Paul Niehans (1882–1971), a Swiss
physician, became known as “the father of cell therapy”quite by chance. After a surgical accident by a colleague,Niehans attempted to transplant a patient’s severely dam-aged parathyroid glands with those of a steer. When thepatient began to rapidly deteriorate before the transplantcould take place, Niehans decided to dice the steer’sparathyroid gland into fine pieces, mix the pieces in asaline solution, and inject them into the dying patient.Immediately, the patient began to improve and, in fact,lived for another 30 years.
Cell therapy is, in effect, a type of organ transplant"
"Cell therapy is, in effect, a type of organ transplant
which has also been referred to as “live cell therapy,”“xenotransplant therapy,” “cellular suspensions,” “glan-dular therapy,” or “fresh cell therapy.” The procedureinvolves the injection of either whole fetal xenogenic(animal) cells (e.g., from sheep, cows, pigs, and sharks)or cell extracts from human tissue. The latter is known asautologous cell therapy if the cells are extracted from andtransplanted back into the same patient. Several differenttypes of cells can be administered simultaneously.
Just as Paracelsus’ theory of “like cures like,” the
types of cells that are administered correspond in some

"way with the organ or tissue in the patient that is failing.
No one knows exactly how cell therapy works, but pro-ponents claim that the injected cells travel to the similarorgan from which they were taken to revitalize and stim-ulate that organ’s function and regenerate its cellularstructure. In other words, the cells are not species specif-ic, but only organ specific. Supporters of cellular treat-ment believe that embryonic and fetal animal tissue con-tain active therapeutic agents distinct from vitamins ,
minerals , hormones, or enzymes.
Swedish researchers have successfully transplanted
human fetal stem cells into human recipients, and theprocedure is being investigated further as a possibletreatment for repairing brain cells in Parkinson’spatients. However, because the cells used in these appli-cations must be harvested from aborted human fetuses,there is an ethical debate over their use.

Paul Niehans was born and raised in Switzerland.
His father, a doctor, was dismayed when he entered theseminary, but Niehans quickly grew dissatisfied with reli-gious life and took up medicine after all. He first studiedat Bern, then completed an internship in Zurich.Niehans enlisted in the Swiss Army in 1912. When
war erupted in the Balkans, Niehans set up a hospital inBelgrade, Yugoslavia. The war provided him the opportu-nity to treat numerous patients, gaining a firsthand knowl-edge of the body and its workings.
Since 1913, Niehans had been intrigued with Alexis

therapy. That year, he treated a patient suffering fromtetany whose parathyroid had been erroneously removedby another physician. Too weak for a glandular transplant,the patient was given injections of the parathyroid glandsof an ox, and she soon recovered. Niehans made moreinjections, even experimenting on himself, and reportedhe could cure illnesses through injections of live cellsextracted from healthy animal organs. He believedadding new tissue stimulated rejuvenation and recovery.
Niehans treated Pope Pious XII with his injections

depressants
Definition
Central nervous system (CNS) depressants are drugs
that can be used to slow down brain activity.
Purpose
CNS depressants may be prescribed by a physician
to treat anxiety, muscle tension, pain, insomnia, acutestress reactions, panic attacks, and seizure disorders. Inhigher doses, some CNS depressants may be used asgeneral anesthetics.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 688Central nervous system depressantsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 688"
"Description
Throughout history, humans have sought relief from
anxiety and insomnia by using substances that depressbrain activity and induce a drowsy or calming effect. CNSdepressants include a wide range of drugs such as alcohol,narcotics, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal), ben-zodiazepines (Ativan, Halcion, Librium, Valium, Xanax),chloral hydrate, and methaqualone (Quaaludes), as well asnewer CNS depressants developed in the 1990s, such asBuspirone (Buspar) and Zolpidem (Ambien), which arethought to have the fewest sideeffects. Most CNS depres-sants activate a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobu-tyric acid (GABA), which helps decrease brain activity.Street names for CNS depressants include Reds, Yellows,Blues, Ludes, Barbs, and Downers.
Precautions
Most CNS depressants have the potential to be physi-"
"cally and psychologically addictive. Alcohol is the mostwidely abused depressant. The body tends to develop tol-erance for CNS depressants, and larger doses are neededto achieve the same effects. Withdrawal from some CNSdepressants can be uncomfortable; for example, with-drawal from a depressant treating insomnia or anxiety cancause rebound insomnia or anxiety as the brain’s activitybounces back after being suppressed. In some cases with-drawal can result in life-threatening seizures. Generally,depressant withdrawal should be undertaken under aphysician’s supervision. Many physicians will reduce thedepressant dosage gradually, to give the body time toadjust. Certain CNS depressants such as barbiturates areeasy to overdose on, since there is a relatively small dif-ference between the optimal dose and an overdose. Asmall miscalculation can lead to coma, slowed breathing,and death. CNS depressants should be administered toelderly individuals with care, as these individuals have areduced"
"should be administered toelderly individuals with care, as these individuals have areduced ability to metabolize CNS depressants."
"Side Effects
Especially when taken in excess, CNS depressants can
cause confusion and dizziness, and impair judgment, mem-ory, intellectual performance, and motor coordination.
Interactions
CNS depressants should be used with other medica-
tions, such as antidepressant medications, only under aphysician’s supervision. Certain herbal remedies, such asValerian and Kava, may dangerously exacerbate theeffects of certain CNS depressants. Also, ingesting a com-bination of CNS depressants, such Valium and alcohol,for example, is not advised. When mixed together, CNSKEY TERMS

"Description
In general, the CNS is well defended against infec-
tion. The spine and brain are sheathed in tough, protec-tive membranes. The outermost membrane, the duramater, and the next layer, the arachnoid, entirely encasethe brain and spinal cord. However, these defenses arenot absolute. In rare cases, bacteria gain access to areaswithin the CNS.

"Bacterial infection of the CNS can result in abscess-
es and empyemas (accumulations of pus). Abscesseshave fixed boundaries, but empyemas lack definableshape and size. CNS infections are classified accordingto the location where they occur. For example, a spinalepidural abscess is located above the dura mater, and a
cranial subdural empyema occurs between the dura
mater and the arachnoid.
As pus and other material from an infection accumu-
late, pressure is exerted on the brain or spinal cord. Thispressure can damage the nervous system tissue, possiblypermanently. Without treatment, a CNS infection is fatal.
Causes and symptoms
Typically, bacterial invasion results from the spread
of a nearby infection; for example, a chronic sinus ormiddle ear infection can extend beyond its initial site.Bacteria may also be conveyed to the CNS from distantsites of infection by the bloodstream. In rare cases, headtrauma or surgical procedures may introduce bacteriaKEY TERMS"
"Abscess —A pus-filled area with definite borders.
Arachnoid —One of the membranes that sheathes
the spinal cord and brain; the arachnoid is the sec-ond-layer membrane.
Cerebrospinal fluid —Fluid that is normally found
in the spinal cord and brain. Abnormal levels ofcertain molecules in this fluid can indicate thepresence of infection or damage to the central ner-vous system.

cannot always be identified.
Specific symptoms of a CNS infection hinge on its
exact location, but may include severe headache or back
pain , weakness, sensory loss, and a fever . An individual
may report a stiff neck, nausea or vomiting, and tirednessor disorientation. There is a potential for seizures, paral-

CT scans or MRI scans of the brain and spinecan provide definitive diagnosis, with an MRI scan beingthe most sensitive. A lumbar puncture and analysis of thecerebrospinal fluid can help diagnose an epiduralabscess; however, the procedure can be dangerous incases of subdural empyema.
Treatment
A two-pronged approach is taken to treat CNS infec-
tions. First, antibiotic therapy against an array of potentialinfectious bacteria is begun. The second stage involvessurgery to drain the infected site. Although some CNSinfections have been resolved with antibiotics alone, the"
"more aggressive approach is often preferred. Surgery allowsimmediate relief of pressure on the brain or spinal cord, aswell as an opportunity to collect infectious material for bac-terial identification. Once the bacterial species is identified,drug therapy can be altered to a more specific antibiotic.However, surgery may not be an option in some cases, suchas when there are numerous sites of infection or when infec-tion is located in an inaccessible area of the brain.
Prognosis
The fatality rate associated with CNS infections
ranges from 10% to as high as 40%. Some survivorsexperience permanent CNS damage, resulting in partialparalysis, speech problems, or seizures. Rapid diagnosisand treatment are essential for a good prognosis. Withprompt medical attention, an individual may recovercompletely.

Central nervous system
stimulants
Definition
Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants are medi-
cines that speed up physical and mental processes.
Purpose
Central nervous system stimulants are used to treat
conditions characterized by lack of adrenergic stimula-tion, including narcolepsy and neonatal apnea. Addition-"
"ally, methylphenidate (Ritalin) and dextroamphetaminesulfate (Dexedrine) are used for their paradoxical effectin attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ).
The anerexiants, benzphetamine (Didrex), diethyl-
propion (Tenuate), phendimetrazine (Bontril, Plegine),phentermine (Fastin, Ionamine), and sibutramine(Meridia) are CNS stimulants used for appetite reductionin severe obesity . Although these drugs are structurally
similar to amphetamine, they cause less sensation ofstimulation, and are less suited for use in conditionscharacterized by lack of adrenergic stimulation.
Phenylpropanolamine and ephedrine have been used
both as diet aids and as vasoconstrictors.
Description
The majority of CNS stimulants are chemically sim-
ilar to the neurohormone norepinephrine, and simulatethe traditional “fight or flight” syndrome associated withsympathetic nervous system arousal. Caffeine is more"
"closely related to the xanthines, such as theophylline. Asmall number of additional members of the CNS stimu-lant class do not fall into specific chemical groups.
Precautions
Amphetamines have a high potential for abuse. They
should be used in weight reduction programs only whenalternative therapies have been ineffective. Administra-tion for prolonged periods ma y lead to drug dependence.
These drugs are classified as schedule II under federaldrug control regulations.
The amphetamines and their cogeners are con-
traindicated in advanced arteriosclerosis, symptomaticcardiovascular disease, and moderate to severe hyper-
tension and hyperthyroidism . They should not be used
to treat patients with hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy tothe sympathomimetic amines, or with glaucoma , a histo-
ry of agitated states, a history of drug abuse, or duringthe 14 days following administration of monoamine oxi-dase (MAO) inhibitors.
Methylphenidate may lower the seizure threshold."
"Methylphenidate may lower the seizure threshold.
Benzphetamine is category X during pregnancy .
Diethylpropion is category B. Other anorexiants have notbeen rated; however their use during pregnancy does notappear to be advisable. Safety for use of anorexiants hasnot been evaluated.
Amphetamines are all category C during pregnancy.
Breastfeeding while receiving amphetamines is not rec-ommended because the infant may experience withdraw-al symptoms.
There have been reports that when used in children,
methylphenidate and amphetamines may retard growth.Although these reports have been questioned, it may besuggested that the drugs not be administered outside ofschool hours (because most children have behavior prob-lems in school), in order to permit full stature to beattained.
The most common adverse effects of CNS stimulants
are associated with their primary action. Typical respons-es include overstimulation, dizziness , restlessness, and"
"similar reactions. Rarely, hematologic reactions, includ-ing leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and bone marrowdepression have been reported. Lowering of the seizurethreshold has been noted with most drugs in this class.
Withdrawal syndrome
Abrupt discontinuation following prolonged high
dosage results in extreme fatigue , mental depression and
changes on the sleep EEG. This response is most evidentwith amphetamines, but may be observed with all CNSstimulants taken over a prolonged period of time.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy
Definition
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is also known
as congophilic angiopathy or cerebrovascular amyloido-
sis. It is a disease of small blood vessels in the brain in"
"sis. It is a disease of small blood vessels in the brain in
which deposits of amyloid protein in the vessel wallsmay lead to stroke , brain hemorrhage, or dementia .
Amyloid protein resembles a starch and is deposited intissues during the course of certain chronic diseases.
Description
CAA may affect patients over age 45, but is most com-
mon in patients over age 65, and becomes more commonwith increasing age. Men and women are equally affected.In some cases, CAA is sporadic but it may also be inheritedas an autosomal dominant condition (a form of inheritancein which only one copy of a gene coding for a disease needbe present for that disease to be expressed; if either parenthas the disease, a child has a 50% chance of inheriting thedisease). CAA is responsible for 5–20% of brain hemor-rhages and up to 30% of lobar hemorrhages localized to onelobe of the brain. CAA may be found during an autopsy in"
"over one-third of persons over age 60, even though theymay not have had brain hemorrhage, stroke, or other mani-festations of the disease during life. In Alzheimer’s disease ,
CAA is more common than in the general population, andmay occur in more than 80% of patients over age 60.
Causes and symptoms
The cause of amyloid deposits in blood vessels in the
brain in sporadic CAA is not known. In hereditary CAA,

"genetic defects, typically on chromosome 21, allow accu-
mulation of amyloid, a protein made up of units calledbeta-pleated sheet fibrils. The fibrils tend to clump togeth-er, so that the amyloid cannot be dissolved and builds upin the brain blood vessel walls. One form of amyloid fibrilsubunit proteins is the amyloid beta protein.
Different theories have been suggested for the
source of amyloid beta protein in the brain. The systemictheory suggests that amyloid beta protein in the bloodstream is deposited in blood vessels in the brain, causingweakness in the blood vessel wall and breakdown in theblood-brain barrier. Normally, the blood-brain barrierkeeps proteins and other large molecules from escapingfrom the blood vessel to the brain tissue. When there isbreakdown of the blood-brain barrier, amyloid beta pro-tein leaks through the blood vessel wall, and is depositedin the brain substance, where it forms an abnormal struc-ture called a neuritic plaque."
"A second, more likely theory is that amyloid fibrils
that form amyloid beta protein are produced by perivas-cular microglia, or support cells in contact with the brainblood vessel wall. The third theory is that the brain tissuegives rise to amyloid beta protein. Both the nerve cellsand the glia are known to produce amyloid precursorprotein, which increases with aging and with cell stress .
Bleeding into the brain may occur as tiny blood ves-
sels carrying amyloid deposits become heavier and morebrittle, and are therefore more likely to burst with minortrauma or with fluctuating blood pressure. Aneurysms, orballooning of the blood vessel wall, may develop, andmay also rupture as the stretched wall becomes thinnerand is under more pressure. Amyloid deposits maydestroy smooth muscle cells or cause inflammation in theblood vessel wall. This may also cause the blood vesselto break more easily.
The most common form of CAA is the sporadic"
"The most common form of CAA is the sporadic
form associated with aging. This type of CAA usuallycauses lobar hemorrhage, which may recur in differentlobes of the brain. The frontal lobe (behind the forehead)and parietal lobe (behind the frontal lobe) are most oftenaffected; the temporal lobe (near the temple) and occipi-tal lobe (at the back of the brain) are affected less often;and the cerebellum (under the occipital lobe) is rarelyaffected. Approximately 10–50% of hemorrhages in spo-radic CAA involve more than one lobe.
Symptoms of lobar hemorrhage in CAA include
sudden onset of headache , neurologic symptoms such as
weakness, sensory loss, visual changes, or speech prob-lems, depending on which lobe is involved; anddecreased level of consciousness (a patient who is diffi-cult to arouse), nausea, and vomiting. Sporadic CAAmay be associated with symptoms unrelated to lobarKEY TERMS

Diagnosis
As in most neurologic diseases, diagnosis is made
most often from the patient’s history, with careful inquiryinto family history and the patient’s onset and pattern ofsymptoms, as well as neurologic examination. Braincomputed tomography scan (CT) or magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) may identify lobar hemorrhage,
stroke, or petechial hemorrhages, and are important inexcluding arteriovenous malformation, brain tumor ,o r
other causes of hemorrhage. Angiography (x-ray study
of the interior of blood vessels and the heart) is not help-ful in diagnosis of CAA, but may be needed to excludeaneurysm. Brain biopsy (surgical removal of a small"
"piece of brain tissue) may show characteristic amyloiddeposits, but is rarely performed, as the risk may not bejustifiable in the absence of effective treatment for CAA.If diagnosis is uncertain, biopsy may be needed to ruleout conditions which are potentially treatable. Definitediagnosis requires microscopic examination of brain tis-sue, either at biopsy, at autopsy, or at surgery when brainhemorrhage is drained. Lumbar puncture to examinecerebrospinal fluid proteins may show characteristicabnormalities, but is not part of the routine exam. Infamilial forms, genetic analysis may be helpful.

"CAA with hemorrhage must be distinguished from
other types of brain hemorrhage. In CAA, hemorrhagetypically occurs in the lobar region, often ruptures into thesubarachnoid space between the brain and its coverings,and occurs at night. In hemorrhage related to high bloodpressure, hemorrhage is usually deeper within the brain,ruptures into the ventricles or cavities deep inside thebrain, and occurs during daytime activities. Other causesof brain hemorrhage are arteriovenous malformations ,
trauma, aneurysms, bleeding into a brain tumor, vasculi-
tis(inflammation of blood vessels), or bleeding disorders.

"Treatment
Although there is no effective treatment for the under-
lying disease process of CAA, measures can be taken toprevent brain hemorrhage in patients diagnosed with CAA.High blood pressure should be treated aggressively, andeven normal blood pressure can be lowered as much as tol-erated without side effects from medications. Blood thin-ners such as Coumadin, antiplatelet agents such as aspirin ,
or medications designed to dissolve blood clots may causehemorrhage in patients with CAA, and should be avoided ifpossible. If these medications are required for other condi-tions, such as heart disease, the potential benefits must becarefully weighed against the increased risks.
Seizures, or recurrent neurologic symptoms thought"
"Seizures, or recurrent neurologic symptoms thought
to be seizures, should be treated with anti-epilepticdrugs, although Depakote (sodium valproate) should beavoided because of its antiplatelet effect. Anti-epilepticdrugs are sometimes given to patients with large lobarhemorrhage in an attempt to prevent seizures, althoughthe benefit of this is unclear.
Once brain hemorrhage has occurred, the patient
should be admitted to a hospital (ICU) for neurologicmonitoring and control of increased pressure within thebrain, blood pressure control, and supportive medical
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 696Cerebral amyloid angiopathyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 696"
"care. Antiplatelet agents and blood thinners should be dis-
continued and their effects reversed, if possible. Surgerymay be needed to remove brain hemorrhage, althoughbleeding during surgery may be difficult to control.
CAA may be rarely associated with cerebral vasculitis,
or inflammation of the blood vessel walls. In these casestreatment with steroids or immune system suppressantsmay be helpful. Without tissue examination, vasculitis can-not be diagnosed reliably, and probably coexists with CAAtoo rarely to justify steroid treatment in most cases.
Prognosis
Since CAA is associated with progressive blood ves-
sel degeneration, and since there is no effective treat-ment, most patients have a poor prognosis. Aggressiveneurosurgical management allows increased survival fol-lowing lobar hemorrhage, but as of 1998, 20–90% ofpatients die from the first hemorrhage or its complica-tions, which include progression of hemorrhage, brainedema (swelling) with herniation (downward pressure"
"on vital brain structures), seizures, and infections such aspneumonia . Many survivors have persistent neurologic
deficits related to the brain lobe affected by hemorrhage,and are at risk for additional hemorrhages, seizures, anddementia. Prognosis is worse in patients who are older,or who have larger hemorrhages or recurrent hemor-rhages within a short time.

Cerebral aneurysm
Definition
A cerebral aneurysm occurs at a weak point in the
wall of a blood vessel (artery) that supplies blood to thebrain. Because of the flaw, the artery wall bulges outwardand fills with blood. This bulge is called an aneurysm. Ananeurysm can rupture, spilling blood into the surround-ing body tissue. A ruptured cerebral aneurysm can causepermanent brain damage, disability, or death .
Description
A cerebral aneurysm can occur anywhere in the brain."
"Description
A cerebral aneurysm can occur anywhere in the brain.
Aneurysms can have several shapes. The saccularaneurysm, once called a berry aneurysm, resembles a pieceof fruit dangling from a branch. Saccular aneurysms areusually found at a branch in the blood vessel where theyballoon out by a thin neck. Saccular cerebral aneurysmsmost often occur at the branch points of large arteries at thebase of the brain. Aneurysms may also take the form of abulge in one wall of the artery—a lateral aneurysm—or awidening of the entire artery—a fusiform aneurysm.
The greatest danger of aneurysms is rupture.
Approximately 50–75% of stricken people survive ananeurysmal rupture. A ruptured aneurysm spills bloodinto the brain or into the fluid-filled area that surroundsthe brain tissue. Bleeding into this area, called the sub-arachnoid space, is referred to as subarachnoid hemor-
rhage (SAH). About 25,000 people suffer a SAH each"
"rhage (SAH). About 25,000 people suffer a SAH each
year. It is estimated that people with unrupturedaneurysm have an annual 1–2% risk of hemorrhage.Under age 40, more men experience SAH. After age 40,more women than men are affected.
Most people who have suffered a SAH from a rup-
tured aneurysm did not know that the aneurysm evenexisted. Based on autopsy studies, medical researchers
estimate that 1–5% of the population has some type ofcerebral aneurysm. Aneurysms rarely occur in the veryyoung or the very old; about 60% of aneurysms are diag-nosed in people between ages 40 and 65.
Some aneurysms may have a genetic link and run in"
"Some aneurysms may have a genetic link and run in
families. The genetic link has not been completelyproven and a pattern of inheritance has not been deter-mined. Some studies seem to show that first-degree rela-tives of people who suffered aneurysmal SAH are morelikely to have aneurysms themselves. These studiesreported that such immediate family members were fourtimes more likely to have aneurysms than the generalpopulation. Other studies do not confirm these findings.Better evidence links aneurysms to certain rare diseasesof the connective tissue. These diseases include Marfan
syndrome ,pseudoxanthoma elasticum ,Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome , and fibromuscular dysplasia. Polycystic kid-
ney disease is also associated with cerebral aneurysms.
These diseases are also associated with an increased
risk of aneurysmal rupture. Certain other conditions raise
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 697Cerebral aneurysmGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 697"
"the risk of rupture, too. Most aneurysms that rupture are
a half-inch or larger in diameter. Size is not the only fac-tor, however, because smaller aneurysms also rupture.Cigarette smoking , excessive alcohol consumption, and
recreational drug use (for example, use of cocaine ) have
been linked with an increased risk. The role, if any, ofhigh blood pressure has not been determined. Some stud-ies have implicated high blood pressure in aneurysm for-mation and rupture, but people with normal blood pres-sure also experience aneurysms and SAHs. High bloodpressure may be a risk factor but not the most importantone. Pregnancy , labor, and delivery also seem to
increase the possibility that an aneurysm might rupture,but not all doctors agree. Physical exertion and use oforal contraceptives are not suspected causes for aneurys-mal rupture.

infection, hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ), or"
"infection, hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ), or
abnormal rapid cell growth (neoplastic disease), but mostseem to arise from a congenital, or developmental,defect. These congenital aneurysms occur more frequent-ly in women. Whatever the cause may be, the inner wall
of the blood vessel is abnormally thin and the pressure ofthe blood flow causes an aneurysm to form.
Most aneurysms go unnoticed until they rupture.
However, 10–15% of unruptured cerebral aneurysms arefound because of their size or their location. Commonwarning signs include symptoms that affect only one eye,such as an enlarged pupil, a drooping eyelid, or pain
above or behind the eye. Other symptoms are a localizedheadache , unsteady gait, a temporary problem with

Symptoms of such an aneurysm develop gradually. Thesymptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, neck pain,black-outs, ringing in the ears, dizziness , or seeing spots.
Eighty to ninety percent of aneurysms are not diag-
nosed until after they have ruptured. Rupture is notalways a sudden event. Nearly 50% of patients who haveaneurysmal SAHs also experience “the warning leakphenomenon.” Persons with warning leak symptomshave sudden, atypical headaches that occur days orweeks before the actual rupture. These headaches are

dizziness may accompany sentinel headaches. Unfortu-nately, these symptoms can be confused with tensionheadaches or migraines, and treatment can be delayeduntil rupture occurs.
When an aneurysm ruptures, most victims experi-
ence a sudden, extremely severe headache. Thisheadache is typically described as the worst headache ofthe victim’s life. Nausea and vomiting commonly
accompany the headache. The person may experience ashort loss of consciousness or prolonged coma . Other
common signs of a SAH include a stiff neck, fever , and a

of hemorrhage.
If the CT scan is negative for a hemorrhage or pro-
vides an unclear diagnosis, the doctor will order a cere-
brospinal fluid (CSF) analysis , also called a lumbar
puncture. In this procedure, a small amount of cere-brospinal fluid is removed from the lower back andexamined for traces of blood and blood-breakdown prod-ucts. If this test is positive, cerebral angiography is used"
"to map the brain’s blood vessels and the damaged area.The angiography is done to pinpoint the aneurysm’slocation. About 15% of people who experience SAHhave more than one aneurysm. For this reason, angiogra-phy should include both the common carotid artery thatfeeds the front of the brain and the vertebral artery thatfeeds the base of the brain. Occasionally, the angiogra-phy fails to find the aneurysm and must be repeated. Ifseizures occur, electroencephalography (EEG) may be
used to measure the electrical activity of the brain.
Treatment
Unruptured aneurysm
If an aneurysm has not ruptured and is not causing
any symptoms, it may be left untreated. Because there isa 1–2% chance of rupture per year, the cumulative riskover a number of years may justify surgical treatment.

"However, if the aneurysm is small or in a place that
would be difficult to reach, or if the person who has theaneurysm is in poor health, the surgical treatment may bea greater risk than the aneurysm. Risk of rupture is high-er for people who have more than one aneurysm. Unrup-tured aneurysm would probably be treated with a surgi-cal procedure called the clip ligation, as described below.
Ruptured aneurysm

"Ruptured aneurysm
The primary treatment for a ruptured aneurysm
involves stabilizing the victim’s condition, treating theimmediate symptoms, and promptly assessing furthertreatment options, especially surgical procedures. Thepatient may require mechanical ventilation, oxygen, andfluids. Medications may be given to prevent major sec-ondary complications such as seizures, rebleeding, andvasospasm (narrowing of the affected blood vessel).Vasospasm decreases blood flow to the brain and causesthe death of nerve cells. A drug such as nimodipine(Nimotop) may help prevent vasospasm by relaxing thesmooth muscle tissue of the arteries. Even with treat-ment, however, vasospasm may cause stroke or death.
To prevent further hemorrhage from the aneurysm, it"
"To prevent further hemorrhage from the aneurysm, it
must be removed from circulation. In general, surgicalprocedures should be performed as soon as possible toprevent rebleeding. The chances that aneurysm willrebleed are greatest in the first 24 hours, and vasospasmusually does not occur until 72 hours or more after rup-ture. If the patient is in poor condition or if there isvasospasm or other complication, surgical proceduresmay be delayed. The preferred surgical method is a clipligation in which a clip is placed around the base of theaneurysm to block it off from circulation. Surgical coat-ing, wrapping, or trapping of the aneurysm may also beperformed. These procedures do not completely removethe aneurysm from circulation, however, and there issome risk that it may rebleed in the future. Newer tech-niques that look promising include balloon embolization,a procedure that blocks the aneurysm with an inflatablemembrane introduced by means of a catheter insertedthrough the artery."
"Prognosis
An unruptured aneurysm may not cause any symp-
toms over an entire lifetime. Surgical clip ligation willensure that it won’t rupture, but it may be better to leavethe aneurysm alone in some cases. Familial cerebralaneurysms may rupture earlier than those without agenetic link.
The outlook is not as good for a person who suffers a
ruptured aneurysm. Fifteen to twenty-five percent ofpeople who experience a ruptured aneurysm do not sur-vive. An additional 25–50% die as a result of complica-"
"tions associated with the hemorrhage. Of the survivors,15–50% suffer permanent brain damage and disability.These conditions are caused by the death of nerve cells.Nerve cells can be destroyed by the hemorrhage itself orby complications from the hemorrhage, such asvasospasm or hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus, a dilata-tion (expansion) of the fluid-filled cavity surrounding thebrain, occurs in about 15% of cases. Immediate medicaltreatment is vital to prevent further complications andbrain damage in those who survive the initial rupture.Patients who survive SAH and aneurysm clipping areunlikely to die from events related to SAH.
Prevention
There are no known methods to prevent an aneurysm
from forming. If an aneurysm is discovered before it rup-tures, it may be surgically removed. CT or MRI angiogra-phy may be recommended for relatives of patients withfamilial cerebral aneurysms.

"Cerebral palsy
Definition
Cerebral palsy (CP) is the term used for a group of
nonprogressive disorders of movement and posturecaused by abnormal development of, or damage to,motor control centers of the brain. CP is caused by eventsbefore, during, or after birth. The abnormalities of mus-cle control that define CP are often accompanied byother neurological and physical abnormalities.
Description
V oluntary movement (walking, grasping, chewing,
etc.) is primarily accomplished using muscles that areattached to bones, known as the skeletal muscles. Controlof the skeletal muscles originates in the cerebral cortex,the largest portion of the brain. Palsy means paralysis ,"
"but may also be used to describe uncontrolled musclemovement. Therefore, cerebral palsy encompasses anydisorder of abnormal movement and paralysis caused byabnormal function of the cerebral cortex. In truth, howev-er, CP does not include conditions due to progressive dis-ease or degeneration of the brain. For this reason, CP isalso referred to as static (nonprogressive) encephalopathy(disease of the brain). Also excluded from CP are any dis-orders of muscle control that arise in the muscles them-selves and/or in the peripheral nervous system (nervesoutside the brain and spinal cord).
CP is not a specific diagnosis, but is more accurately
considered a description—a description of a broad butdefined group of neurological and physical problems.
The symptoms of CP and their severity are quite"
"The symptoms of CP and their severity are quite
variable. Those with CP may have only minor difficultywith fine motor skills, such as grasping and manipulatingitems with their hands. A severe form of CP couldinvolve significant muscle problems in all four limbs,mental retardation , seizures, and difficulties with
vision, speech, and hearing.
Muscles that receive defective messages from the"
"vision, speech, and hearing.
Muscles that receive defective messages from the
brain may be constantly contracted and tight (spastic),exhibit involuntary writhing movements (athetosis), orhave difficulty with voluntary movement (dyskinesia).There can also be a lack of balance and coordination withunsteady movements (ataxia). A combination of any ofthese problems may also occur. Spastic CP and mixedCP constitute the majority of cases. Effects on the mus-cles can range from mild weakness or partial paralysis(paresis), to complete loss of voluntary control of a mus-cle or group of muscles (plegia). CP is also designated bythe number of limbs affected. For instance, affected mus-cles in one limb is monoplegia, both arms or both legs isdiplegia, both limbs on one side of the body is hemiple-gia, and in all four limbs is quadriplegia. Muscles of thetrunk, neck, and head may be affected as well.

"CP can be caused by a number of different mecha-
nisms at various times—from several weeks after concep-tion, through birth, to early childhood. For many years, itwas accepted that most cases of CP were due to braininjuries received during a traumatic birth, known as birthasphyxia. However, extensive research in the 1980sshowed that only 5–10% of CP can be attributed to birthtrauma. Other possible causes include abnormal develop-ment of the brain, prenatal factors that directly or indirectlydamage neurons in the developing brain, premature birth,and brain injuries that occur in the first few years of life.
Advances in the medical care of premature infants in
the last 20 years have dramatically increased the rate ofsurvival of these fragile newborns. However, as gesta-tional age at delivery and birth weight of a babydecrease, the risk for CP dramatically increases. A termpregnancy is delivered at 37–41 weeks gestation. The"
"risk for CP in a preterm infant (32–37 weeks) isincreased about five-fold over the risk for an infant bornat term. Survivors of extremely preterm births (less than28 weeks) face as much as a 50-fold increase in risk.About 50% of all cases of CP now being diagnosed are inchildren who were born prematurely.
Two factors are involved in the risk for CP associat-
ed with prematurity . First, premature babies are at high-
er risk for various CP-associated medical complications,such as intracerebral hemorrhage, infection, and difficul-ty in breathing, to name a few. Second, the onset of pre-
mature labor may be induced, in part, by complications
that have already caused neurologic damage in the fetus.A combination of both factors almost certainly plays arole in some cases of CP. The tendency toward prematuredelivery runs in families, but the genetic mechanisms arefar from clear.
An increase in multiple pregnancies in recent years,"
"An increase in multiple pregnancies in recent years,
especially in the United States, is blamed on theincreased use of fertility drugs. As the number of fetusesin a pregnancy increases, the risks for abnormal develop-ment and premature delivery also increase. Childrenfrom twin pregnancies have four times the risk of devel-oping CP as children from singleton pregnancies, owingto the fact that more twin pregnancies are delivered pre-maturely. The risk for CP in a child of triplets is up to 18times greater. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests thata baby from a pregnancy in which its twin died beforebirth is at increased risk for CP.
Approximately 500,000 children and adults in the
United States have CP, and it is newly diagnosed in about6,000 infants and young children each year. The inci-

"dence of CP has not changed much in the last 20–30
years. Ironically, advances in medicine have decreasedthe incidence from some causes, Rh disease for example,but increased it from others, notably, prematurity andmultiple pregnancies. No particular ethnic groups seemto be at higher risk for CP. However, people of disadvan-taged background are at higher risk due to poorer accessto proper prenatal care and advanced medical services.
Causes and symptoms
As noted, CP has many causes, making a discussion
of the genetics of CP complicated. A number of heredi-tary/genetic syndromes have signs and symptoms similarto CP, but usually also have problems not typical of CP.Put another way, some hereditary conditions “mimic”CP. Isolated CP, meaning CP that is not a part of someother syndrome or disorder, is usually not inherited.

"It might be possible to group the causes of CP into
those that are genetic and those that are non-genetic, butmost would fall somewhere in between. Grouping causesinto those that occur during pregnancy (prenatal), thosethat happen around the time of birth (perinatal), and thosethat occur after birth (postnatal), is preferable. CP relatedto premature birth and multiple pregnancies (twins,triplets, etc., not “many pregnancies”) is somewhat differ-ent and considered separately.

"Prenatal causes
Although much has been learned about human
embryology in the last couple of decades, a great dealremains unknown. Studying prenatal human develop-ment is difficult because the embryo and fetus develop ina closed environment—the mother’s womb. However,the relatively recent development of a number of prenataltests has opened a window on the process. Add to thatmore accurate and complete evaluations of newborns,especially those with problems, and a clearer picture ofwhat can go wrong before birth is possible.
The complicated process of brain development before"
"The complicated process of brain development before
birth is susceptible to many chance errors that can result inabnormalities of varying degrees. Some of these errorswill result in structural anomalies of the brain, while oth-ers may cause undetectable, but significant, abnormalitiesin how the cerebral cortex is “wired.” An abnormality instructure or wiring is sometimes hereditary, but is mostoften due to chance, or a cause unknown at this time.Whether and how much genetics played a role in a particu-lar brain abnormality depends to some degree on the typeof anomaly and the form of CP it causes.
Several maternal-fetal infections are known to
increase the risk for CP, including rubella (Germanmeasles , now rare in the United States), cytomegalovirus
(CMV), and toxoplasmosis . Each of these infections is"
"(CMV), and toxoplasmosis . Each of these infections is
considered a risk to the fetus only if the mother contractsit for the first time during that pregnancy. Even in thosecases, though, most babies will be born normal. Mostwomen are immune to all three infections by the timethey reach childbearing age, but a woman’s immune sta-tus can be determined using the so-called TORCH (forToxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes)test before or during pregnancy.
Just as a stroke can cause neurologic damage in an
adult, so too can this type of event occur in the fetus. Aburst blood vessel in the brain followed by uncontrolledbleeding (coagulopathy), known as intracerebral hemor-rhage, could cause a fetal stroke, or a cerebral blood ves-sel could be obstructed by a clot ( embolism ). Infants who"
"later develop CP, along with their mothers, are more like-ly than other mother-infant pairs to test positive for fac-tors that put them at increased risk for bleeding episodesor blood clots. Some coagulation disorders are strictly
hereditary, but most have a more complicated basis.
A teratogen is any substance to which a woman is
exposed that has the potential to harm the embryo orfetus. Links between a drug or other chemical exposureduring pregnancy and a risk for CP are difficult to prove.However, any substance that might affect fetal braindevelopment, directly or indirectly, could increase therisk for CP. Furthermore, any substance that increases therisk for premature delivery and low birth weight, such asalcohol, tobacco, or cocaine , among others, might indi-
rectly increase the risk for CP.

"rectly increase the risk for CP.
The fetus receives all nutrients and oxygen from
blood that circulates through the placenta. Therefore,anything that interferes with normal placental functionmight adversely affect development of the fetus, includ-ing the brain, or might increase the risk for prematuredelivery. Structural abnormalities of the placenta, prema-ture detachment of the placenta from the uterine wall(abruption), and placental infections (chorioamnionitis)are thought to pose some risk for CP.
Certain conditions in the mother during pregnancy
might pose a risk to fetal development leading to CP.Women with autoimmune anti-thyroid or anti-phospho-lipid (APA) antibodies are at slightly increased risk forCP in their children. A potentially important clue uncov-ered recently points toward high levels of cytokines inthe maternal and fetal circulation as a possible risk forCP. Cytokines are proteins associated with inflammation,such as from infection or autoimmune disorders , and"
"they may be toxic to neurons in the fetal brain. Moreresearch is needed to determine the exact relationship, ifany, between high levels of cytokines in pregnancy and

"CP. A woman has some risk of developing the same com-
plications in more than one pregnancy, slightly increas-ing the risk for more than one child with CP.
Serious physical trauma to the mother during preg-
nancy could result in direct trauma to the fetus as well, orinjuries to the mother could compromise the availabilityof nutrients and oxygen to the developing fetal brain.
Perinatal causes
Birth asphyxia significant enough to result in CP is
now uncommon in developed countries. Tight nuchalcord (umbilical cord around the baby’s neck) and pro-lapsed cord (cord delivered before the baby) are possiblecauses of birth asphyxia, as are bleeding and other com-plications associated with placental abruption and pla-

"centa previa (placenta lying over the cervix).
Infection in the mother is sometimes not passed to
the fetus through the placenta, but is transmitted to thebaby during delivery. Any such infection that results inserious illness in the newborn has the potential to pro-duce some neurological damage.

The remaining 15% of CP is due to neurologic
injury sustained after birth. CP that has a postnatal causeKEY TERMS

newborn is now rare in developed countries due to rou-tine screening of maternal blood type and treatment ofpregnancies at risk.

Rh blood typeposes a risk for recurrence of Rh disease if treatment isnot provided.
Serious infections that affect the brain directly, such
as meningitis and encephalitis , may cause irreversible

"CP is nonprogressive. However, the symptoms of CPoften change over time. Most of the symptoms of CPrelate in some way to the aberrant control of muscles. Toreview, CP is categorized first by the type of move-ment/postural disturbance(s) present, then by a descrip-tion of which limbs are affected, and finally by the sever-ity of motor impairment. For example, spastic diplegiarefers to continuously tight muscles that have no volun-tary control in both legs, while athetoid quadraparesisdescribes uncontrolled writhing movements and muscleweakness in all four limbs. These three-part descriptionsare helpful in providing a general picture, but cannot givea complete description of any one person with CP. Inaddition, the various “forms” of CP do not occur withequal frequency—spastic diplegia is seen in more indi-viduals than is athetoid quadraparesis. CP can also beloosely categorized as mild, moderate, or severe, butthese are very subjective terms with no firm boundariesbetween them."
"A muscle that is tensed and contracted is hypertonic,
while excessively loose muscles are hypotonic. Spastic,hypertonic muscles can cause serious orthopedic prob-lems, including scoliosis (spine curvature), hip disloca-
tion, or contractures . A contracture is shortening of a
muscle, aided sometimes by a weak-opposing force froma neighboring muscle. Contractures may become perma-nent, or “fixed,” without some sort of intervention. Fixedcontractures may cause postural abnormalities in theaffected limbs. Clenched fists and contracted feet (equi-nus or equinovarus) are common in people with CP.Spasticity in the thighs causes them to turn in and crossat the knees, resulting in an unusual method of walkingknown as a “scissors gait.” Any of the joints in the limbsmay be stiff (immobilized) due to spasticity of theattached muscles.

"Athetosis and dyskinesia often occur with spasticity,
but do not often occur alone. The same is true of ataxia.It is important to remember that “mild CP” or “severeCP” refers not only to the number of symptoms present,but also to the level of involvement of any particularclass of symptoms.
Mechanisms that can cause CP are not always
restricted to motor-control areas of the brain. Other neu-rologically based symptoms may include:

"• abnormal sensation and perception
These problems may have a greater impact on a
child’s life than the physical impairments of CP, althoughnot all children with CP are affected by other problems.Many infants and children with CP have growth impair-ment. About one-third of individuals with CP have moder-ate-to-severe mental retardation, one-third have mild men-tal retardation, and one-third have normal intelligence.
Diagnosis
The signs of CP are not usually noticeable at birth.
Children normally progress through a predictable set ofdevelopmental milestones through the first 18 months oflife. Children with CP, however, tend to develop theseskills more slowly because of their motor impairments,and delays in reaching milestones are usually the firstsymptoms of CP. Babies with more severe cases of CPare usually diagnosed earlier than others.
Selected developmental milestones, and the ages for"
"Selected developmental milestones, and the ages for
normally acquiring them, are given below. If a child doesnot acquire the skill by the age shown in parentheses,there is some cause for concern.
• sits well unsupported—six months (eight–10 months)
• babbles—six months (eight months)• crawls—nine months (12 months)
• finger feeds, holds bottle—nine months (12 months)
• walks alone—12 months (15–18 months)
• uses one or two words other than dada/mama—12
months (15 months)
• walks up and down steps—24 months (24–36 months)• turns pages in books; removes shoes and socks—24
months (30 months)
Children do not consistently favor one hand over the
other before 12–18 months, and doing so may be a signthat the child has difficulty using the other hand. Thissame preference for one side of the body may show up asasymmetric crawling or, later on, favoring one leg whileclimbing stairs.

tinued loss of previously acquired milestones indicatesthat CP is not the cause of the problem.
No one test is diagnostic for CP, but certain factors
increase suspicion. The Apgar score measures a baby’scondition immediately after birth. Babies that have lowApgar scores are at increased risk for CP. Presence ofabnormal muscle tone or movements may indicate CP, asmay the persistence of infantile reflexes. Imaging of thebrain using ultrasound, x rays, MRI, and/or CT scans mayreveal a structural anomaly. Some brain lesions associatedwith CP include scarring, cysts, expansion of the cerebralventricles ( hydrocephalus ), periventricular leukomalacia"
"(an abnormality of the area surrounding the ventricles),areas of dead tissue (necrosis), and evidence of an intra-cerebral hemorrhage or blood clot. Blood and urine bio-chemical tests, as well as genetic tests, may be used to ruleout other possible causes, including muscle and peripheralnerve diseases, mitochondrial and metabolic diseases, andother inherited disorders. Evaluations by a pediatric devel-opmental specialist and a geneticist may be of benefit.

"Treatment
Cerebral palsy cannot be cured, but many of the dis-
abilities it causes can be managed through planning andtimely care. Treatment for a child with CP depends on theseverity, nature, and location of the primary muscular symp-toms, as well as any associated problems that might be pre-sent. Optimal care of a child with mild CP may involve reg-ular interaction with only a physical therapist and occupa-tional therapist, whereas care for a more severely affectedchild may include visits to multiple medical specialiststhroughout life. With proper treatment and an effective plan,most people with CP can lead productive, happy lives.
Therapy
Spasticity, muscle weakness, coordination, ataxia,"
"Therapy
Spasticity, muscle weakness, coordination, ataxia,
and scoliosis are all significant impairments that affect theposture and mobility of a person with CP. Physical andoccupational therapists work with the patient, and the fam-ily, to maximize the ability to move affected limbs, devel-op normal motor patterns, and maintain posture. “Assistivetechnology,” things such as wheelchairs, walkers, shoeinserts, crutches, and braces, are often required. A speechtherapist, and high-tech aids such as computer-controlledcommunication devices, can make a tremendous differ-ence in the life of those who have speech impairments.
Medications
Before fixed contractures develop, muscle-relaxant
drugs such as diazepam (Valium), dantrolene (Dantri-um), and baclofen (Lioresal) may be prescribed. Botu-"
"linum toxin (Botox), a newer and highly effective treat-ment, is injected directly into the affected muscles. Alco-hol or phenol injections into the nerve controlling themuscle are another option. Multiple medications areavailable to control seizures, and athetosis can be treatedusing medications such as trihexyphenidyl HCl (Artane)and benztropine (Cogentin).

"Surgery
Fixed contractures are usually treated with either
serial casting or surgery. The most commonly used surgi-cal procedures are tenotomy, tendon transfer, and dorsalrhizotomy. In tenotomy, tendons of the affected muscleare cut and the limb is cast in a more normal positionwhile the tendon regrows. Alternatively, tendon transferinvolves cutting and reattaching a tendon at a differentpoint on the bone to enhance the length and function ofthe muscle. A neurosurgeon performing dorsal rhizotomycarefully cuts selected nerve roots in the spinal cord toprevent them from stimulating the spastic muscles. Neu-rosurgical techniques in the brain such as implanting tinyelectrodes directly into the cerebellum, or cutting a por-tion of the hypothalamus, have very specific uses andhave had mixed results.

Althoughknowledgeable and caring medical professionals areindispensable for developing a care plan, a potentiallymore important source of information and advice isother parents who have dealt with the same set of diffi-culties. Support groups for parents of children with CPcan be significant sources of both practical advice andemotional support. Many cities have support groupsthat can be located through the United Cerebral PalsyAssociation, and most large medical centers have spe-cial multidisciplinary clinics for children with develop-mental disorders.

"The cause of most cases of CP remains unknown,
but it has become clear in recent years that birth difficul-ties are not to blame in most cases. Rather, developmen-tal problems before birth, usually unknown and generallyundiagnosable, are responsible for most cases. The rateof survival for preterm infants has leveled off in recentyears, and methods to improve the long-term health ofthese at-risk babies are now being sought. Currentresearch is also focusing on the possible benefits of rec-ognizing and treating coagulopathies and inflammatorydisorders in the prenatal and perinatal periods. The use ofmagnesium sulfate in pregnant women with preeclamp-sia or threatened preterm delivery may reduce the risk ofCP in very preterm infants. Finally, the risk of CP can bedecreased through good maternal nutrition , avoidance
of drugs and alcohol during pregnancy, and prevention orprompt treatment of infections.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
analysis
Definition
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is a laboratory
test to examine a sample of the fluid surrounding thebrain and spinal cord. This fluid is a clear, watery liquidthat protects the central nervous system from injury andcushions it from the surrounding bone structure. It con-tains a variety of substances, particularly glucose (sugar),protein, and white blood cells from the immune system.The fluid is withdrawn through a needle in a procedurecalled a lumbar puncture.
Purpose"
"Purpose
The purpose of a CSF analysis is to diagnose med-
ical disorders that affect the central nervous system.Some of these conditions include:
• viral and bacterial infections, such as meningitis and
encephalitis
• tumors or cancers of the nervous system• syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease• bleeding (hemorrhaging) around the brain and spinal
cord
• multiple sclerosis, a disease that affects the myelin
coating of the nerve fibers of the brain and spinal cord
• Guillain-Barré syndrome, an inflammation of the nerves.

"Precautions
In some circumstances, a lumbar puncture to with-
draw a small amount of CSF for analysis may lead toserious complications. Lumbar puncture should be per-formed only with extreme caution, and only if the bene-fits are thought to outweigh the risks, in certain condi-tions. For example, in people who have blood clotting(coagulation) or bleeding disorders, lumbar puncturecan cause bleeding that can compress the spinal cord. Ifthere is a large brain tumor or other mass, removal of
CSF can cause the brain to droop down within the skullcavity (herniate), compressing the brain stem and othervital structures, and leading to irreversible brain damageor death . These problems are easily avoided by check-
ing blood coagulation through a blood test and by doinga computed tomography scan (CT) or magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) scan before attempting the lum-"
"nance imaging (MRI) scan before attempting the lum-
bar puncture. In addition, a lumbar puncture procedureshould never be performed at the site of a localized skininfection on the lower back because the infection maybe introduced into the CSF and may spread to the brainor spinal cord.Description
The procedure to remove cerebrospinal fluid is
called a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, because the areaof the spinal column used to obtain the sample is in thelumbar spine, or lower section of the back. In rareinstances, such as a spinal fluid blockage in the middle ofthe back, a doctor may perform a spinal tap in the neck.The lower lumbar spine (usually between the vertebraeknown as L4–5) is preferable because the spinal cordstops near L2, and a needle introduced below this levelwill miss the spinal cord and encounter only nerve roots,which are easily pushed aside.

"A lumbar puncture takes about 30 minutes. Patients
can undergo the test in a doctor’s office, laboratory, oroutpatient hospital setting. Sometimes it requires aninpatient hospital stay. If the patient has spinal arthritis,is extremely uncooperative, or obese, it may be necessaryto introduce the spinal needle using x-ray guidance.
In order to get an accurate sample of cerebrospinal
fluid, it is critical that a patient is in the proper position.The spine must be curved to allow as much space as possi-

During a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, a procedure in which cerebrospinal fluid is aspirated, the physician inserts a hollow,"
thin needle in the space between two vertebrae of the lower back and slowly advances it toward the spine.The cerebrospinalfluid pressure is then measured and the fluid is withdrawn for laboratory analysis.

"ble between the lower vertebrae, or bones of the back, for
the doctor to insert a lumbar puncture needle between thevertebrae and withdraw a small amount of fluid. The mostcommon position is for the patient to lie on his or her sidewith the back at the edge of the exam table, head and chinbent down, knees drawn up to the chest, and arms claspedaround the knees. (Small infants and people who are obesemay need to curve their spines in a sitting position.) Peo-ple should talk to their doctor if they have any questionsabout their position because it is important to be comfort-able and to remain still during the entire procedure.

Patients can go about their normal activities before a

"Risks
For most people, the most common side effect after
the removal of CSF is a headache. This occurs in10–30% of adult patients and in up to 40% of children. Itis caused by a decreased CSF pressure related to a smallleak of CSF through the puncture site. These headachesusually are a dull pain, although some people report athrobbing sensation. A stiff neck and nausea may accom-pany the headache. Lumbar puncture headaches typicallybegin within two days after the procedure and persistfrom a few days to several weeks or months.
Since an upright position worsens the pain, patients
with a lumbar puncture headache can control the pain bylying in a flat position and taking a prescription or non-prescription pain relief medication, preferably one con-taining caffeine . In rare cases, the puncture site leak is

Normal CSF is clear and colorless. It may be cloudy
in infections; straw- or yellow-colored if there is excessprotein, as may occur with cancer or inflammation;
blood-tinged if there was recent bleeding; or yellow tobrown (xanthochromic) if caused by an older instance ofbleeding.

• leukocytes (white blood cells) total less than 5 per mL
• lymphocytes: 60–70%
• monocytes: 30–50%
• neutrophils: none
Normally, there are no red blood cells in the CSF

Cerumen impaction
Definition
Cerumen impaction is a condition in which earwax
has become tightly packed in the external ear canal to thepoint that the canal is blocked.

"Description
Cerumen impaction develops when earwax accumu-
lates in the inner part of the ear canal and blocks theeardrum. It affects between 2–6% of the general popula-tion in the United States. Impaction does not happenunder normal circumstances because cerumen is pro-duced by glands in the outer part of the ear canal; it is notproduced in the inner part. The cerumen traps sand ordust particles before they reach the ear drum. It also pro-tects the outer part of the ear canal because it repelswater. The slow movement of the outer layer of skin ofthe ear canal carries cerumen toward the outer opening ofthe ear. As the older cerumen reaches the opening of theear, it dries out and falls away.

"Causes and symptoms
Causes
Cerumen is most likely to become impacted when it
is pushed against the eardrum by cotton-tipped applica-tors, hair pins, or other objects that people put in theirears; and when it is trapped against the eardrum by ahearing aid. Less common causes of cerumen impactioninclude overproduction of earwax by the glands in theear canal, or an abnormally shaped ear canal.
Symptoms
The most important symptom of cerumen impaction
is partial loss of hearing. Other symptoms are itching ,
tinnitus (noise or ringing in the ears), a sensation of full-
ness in the ear, and pain .
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 709Cerumen impactionGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 709"
"Diagnosis
The diagnosis of impacted cerumen is usually made
by examining the ear canal and eardrum with an oto-scope, an instrument with a light attached that allows thedoctor to look into the canal.
Treatment
Irrigation is the most common method of removing
impacted cerumen. It involves washing out the ear canalwith water from a commercial irrigator or a syringe witha catheter attached. Although some doctors use WaterPiks to remove cerumen, most do not recommend thembecause the stream of water is too forceful and may dam-age the eardrum. The doctor may add a small amount ofalcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other antiseptic. Thewater must be close to body temperature; if it is too coldor too warm, the patient may feel dizzy or nauseated.After the ear has been irrigated, the doctor will applyantibiotic ear drops to protect the ear from infection.
Irrigation should not be used to remove cerumen if"
"Irrigation should not be used to remove cerumen if
the patient’s eardrum is ruptured or missing; if the patienthas a history of chronic otitis media (inflammation of
the middle ear) or a myringotomy (cutting the eardrum toallow fluid to escape from the middle ear); or if thepatient has hearing in only one ear.
If irrigation cannot be used or fails to remove the
cerumen, the patient is referred to an ear, nose, and throat(ENT) specialist. The specialist can remove the wax witha vacuum device or a curette, which is a small scoop-shaped surgical instrument.
Some doctors prescribe special ear drops, such as
Cerumenex, to soften the wax. The most common sideeffect of Cerumenex is an allergic skin reaction. Over-
the-counter wax removal products include Debrox orMurine Ear Drops. A 3% solution of hydrogen peroxidemay also be used. These products are less likely to irri-tate the skin of the ear.

"Prognosis
In most cases, impacted cerumen is successfully
removed by irrigation with no lasting side effects. Irriga-tion can, however, lead to infection of the outer or themiddle ear if the patient has a damaged or absent eardrum. Patients who try to remove earwax themselveswith hair pins or similar objects run the risk of perforat-ing the ear drum or damaging the fragile skin coveringthe ear canal, causing bleeding and the risk of infection.
Prevention
The best method of cleaning the external ear is to
wipe the outer opening with a damp washcloth folded overthe index finger, without going into the ear canal itself.Two techniques have been recommended to prevent ceru-men from reaccumulating in the ear. The patient may placetwo or three drops of mineral oil into each ear once aweek, allow it to remain for two or three minutes, andrinse it out with warm water; or place two drops of Dome-boro otic solution in each ear once a week after showering."
"Patients who wear hearing aids should have their ears
examined periodically for signs of cerumen accumulation.

"In the United States, cervical cancer is the fifth most
common cancer among women aged 35–54, and the thirdmost common cancer of the female reproductive tract. Insome developing countries, it is the most common typeof cancer. It generally begins as an abnormality in thecells on the outside of the cervix. The cervix is the lowerpart or neck of the uterus (womb). It connects the bodyof the uterus to the vagina (birth canal).

"Approximately 90% of cervical cancers are squamous
cell carcinomas. This type of cancer originates in the thin,flat, squamous cells on the surface of the ectocervix, thepart of the cervix that is next to the vagina. (Squamouscells are the thin, flat cells of the surfaces of the skin andcervix and linings of various organs.) Another 10% of cer-vical cancers are of the adenocarcinoma type. This canceroriginates in the mucus-producing cells of the inner orendocervix, near the body of the uterus. Occasionally, thecancer may have characteristics of both types and is calledadenosquamous carcinoma or mixed carcinoma.

"The initial changes that may occur in some cervical
cells are not cancerous. However, these precancerouscells form a lesion called dysplasia or a squamousintraepithelial lesion (SIL), since it occurs within theepithelial or outer layer of cells. These abnormal cellscan also be described as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia(CIN). Moderate to severe dysplasia may be called carci-noma in situ or non-invasive cervical cancer.
Dysplasia is a common condition and the abnormal
cells often disappear without treatment. However, theseprecancerous cells can become cancerous. This may takeyears, although it can happen in less than a year. Eventu-ally, the abnormal cells start to grow uncontrollably intothe deeper layers of the cervix, becoming an invasive cer-vical cancer.

"Although cervical cancer used to be one of the most
common causes of cancer death among American
women, in the past 40 years there has been a 75% decreasein mortality. This is primarily due to routine screeningwith Pap tests (Pap smear), to identify precancerous andearly-invasive stages of cervical cancer. With treatment,these conditions have a cure rate of nearly 100%.
Worldwide, there are more than 400,000 new cases
of cervical cancer diagnosed each year. The AmericanCancer Society (ACS) estimates that there will be 12,900new cases of invasive cervical cancer diagnosed in theUnited States in 2001. More than one million womenwill be diagnosed with a precancerous lesion or non-invasive cancer of the cervix.
Older women are at the highest risk for cervical can-

Rates for carcinoma in situ peak between the ages of 20and 30. In the United States, the incidence of invasivecervical cancer increases rapidly with age for AfricanAmerican women over the age of 25. The incidence risesmore slowly for Caucasian women. However, womenover age 65 account for more than 25% of all cases ofinvasive cervical cancer.
The incidence of cervical cancer is highest among
poor women and among women in developing countries.In the United States, the death rates from cervical cancerare higher among Hispanic, Native American, andAfrican American women than among Caucasianwomen. These groups of women are much less likely toreceive regular Pap tests. Therefore, their cervical can-cers usually are diagnosed at a much later stage, after thecancer has spread to other parts of the body.

"Causes and symptoms
Human papilloma virus
Infection with the common human papilloma virus
(HPV) is a cause of approximately 90% of all cervicalcancers. There are more than 80 types of HPV. About 30of these types can be transmitted sexually, includingthose that cause genital warts (papillomas). About half
of the sexually transmitted HPVs are associated with cer-vical cancer. These “high-risk” HPVs produce a proteinthat can cause cervical epithelial cells to grow uncontrol-lably. The virus makes a second protein that interfereswith tumor suppressors that are produced by the humanimmune system. The HPV-16 strain is thought to be acause of about 50% of cervical cancers.
More than six million women in the United States
have persistent HPV infections, for which there is nocure. Nevertheless, most women with HPV do not devel-op cervical cancer.

"Symptoms of invasive cervical cancer
Most women do not have symptoms of cervical can-
cer until it has become invasive. At that point, the symp-toms may include:
• unusual vaginal discharge
• light vaginal bleeding or spots of blood outside of nor-
mal menstruation
•pain or vaginal bleeding with sexual intercourse
• post-menopausal vaginal bleeding
Once the cancer has invaded the tissue surrounding
the cervix, a woman may experience pain in the pelvicregion and heavy bleeding from the vagina.Diagnosis
The Pap test
Most often, cervical cancer is first detected with a
Pap test that is performed as part of a regular pelvic
examination. The vagina is spread with a metal or plasticinstrument called a speculum. A swab is used to removemucus and cells from the cervix. This sample is sent to alaboratory for microscopic examination.
The Pap test is a screening tool rather than a diag-"
"The Pap test is a screening tool rather than a diag-
nostic tool. It is very efficient at detecting cervicalabnormalities. The Bethesda System commonly is usedto report Pap test results. A negative test means that noabnormalities are present in the cervical tissue. A posi-tive Pap test describes abnormal cervical cells as low-grade or high-grade SIL, depending on the extent ofdysplasia. About 5–10% of Pap tests show at least mildabnormalities. However, a number of factors other thancervical cancer can cause abnormalities, includinginflammation from bacteria or yeast infections. A fewmonths after the infection is treated, the Pap test isrepeated.
Biopsy

"Biopsy
Following an abnormal Pap test, a colposcopy is
usually performed. The physician uses a magnifyingscope to view the surface of the cervix. The cervix maybe coated with an iodine solution that causes normal cellsto turn brown and abnormal cells to turn white or yellow.This is called a Schiller test. If any abnormal areas areobserved, a colposcopic biopsy may be performed. Abiopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue for micro-scopic examination by a pathologist.
Other types of cervical biopsies may be performed."
"Other types of cervical biopsies may be performed.
An endocervical curettage is a biopsy in which a narrowinstrument called a curette is used to scrape tissue frominside the opening of the cervix. A cone biopsy, orconization, is used to remove a cone-shaped piece of tis-sue from the cervix. In a cold knife cone biopsy, a surgi-cal scalpel or laser is used to remove the tissue. A loopelectrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is a conebiopsy using a wire that is heated by an electrical cur-rent. Cone biopsies can be used to determine whetherabnormal cells have invaded below the surface of thecervix. They also can be used to treat many precancersand very early cancers. Biopsies may be performed witha local or general anesthetic. They may cause crampingand bleeding.
Diagnosing the stage
Following a diagnosis of cervical cancer, various
procedures may be used to stage the disease (determine
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 712Cervical cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 712"
"how far the cancer has spread). For example, additional
pelvic exams may be performed under anesthesia.
There are several procedures for determining if cer-
vical cancer has invaded the urinary tract. With cys-
toscopy , a lighted tube with a lens is inserted through the
urethra (the urine tube from the bladder to the exterior)and into the bladder to examine these organs for cancer-ous cells. Tissue samples may be removed for micro-scopic examination by a pathologist. Intravenous urog-
raphy (intravenous pyelogram or IVP) is an x ray of the
urinary system, following the injection of special dye.The kidneys remove the dye from the bloodstream andthe dye passes into the ureters (the tubes from the kid-neys to the bladder) and bladder. IVP can detect ablocked ureter, caused by the spread of cancer to thepelvic lymph nodes (small glands that are part of theimmune system).
A procedure called proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is"
"A procedure called proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is
similar to cystoscopy. It is used to determine whether thecancer has spread to the rectum or lower large intestine.
Computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans, ultra-
sound, or other imaging techniques may be used to deter-mine the spread of cancer to various parts of the body.With a CT scan, an x-ray beam rotates around the body,taking images from various angles. It is used to deter-mine if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. Mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses a magnetic
field to image the body, sometimes is used for evaluatingthe spread of cervical cancer. Chest x rays may be usedto detect cervical cancer that has spread to the lungs.
Treatment
Following a diagnosis of cervical cancer, the physi-
cian takes a medical history and performs a completephysical examination . This includes an evaluation of"
"symptoms and risk factors for cervical cancer. The lymphnodes are examined for evidence that the cancer hasspread from the cervix. The choice of treatment dependson the clinical stage of the disease.
The FIGO system of staging
The International Federation of Gynecologists and
Obstetricians (FIGO) system usually is used to stage cer-vical cancer:
• Stage 0: Carcinoma in situ; non-invasive cancer that is
confined to the layer of cells lining the cervix
• Stage I: Cancer that has spread into the connective tis-
sue of the cervix but is confined to the uterus
• Stage IA: Very small cancerous area that is visible only
with a microscope• Stage IA1: Invasion area is less than 3 mm (0.13 in)
deep and 7 mm (0.33 in) wide
• Stage IA2: Invasion area is 3–5 mm (0.13–0.2 in) deep
and less than 7 mm (0.33 in) wide
• Stage IB: Cancer can be seen without a microscope or is
deeper than 5 mm (0.2 in) or wider than 7 mm (0.33 in)
• Stage IB1: Cancer is no larger than 4 cm (1.6 in)"
"• Stage IB1: Cancer is no larger than 4 cm (1.6 in)
• Stage IB2: Stage IB cancer is larger than 4 cm (1.6 in)
• Stage II: Cancer has spread from the cervix but is con-
fined to the pelvic region
• Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to the upper region of the
vagina, but not to the lower one-third of the vagina
• Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to the parametrial tissue
adjacent to the cervix
• Stage III: Cancer has spread to the lower one-third of
the vagina or to the wall of the pelvis and may beblocking the ureters
• Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the lower vagina but
not to the pelvic wall
• Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the pelvic wall and/or
is blocking the flow of urine through the ureters to thebladder
• Stage IV: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body• Stage IV A: Cancer has spread to the bladder or rectum• Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to distant organs such as
the lungs
• Recurrent: Following treatment, cancer has returned to
the cervix or some other part of the body"
"• Recurrent: Following treatment, cancer has returned to
the cervix or some other part of the body
In addition to the stage of the cancer, factors such as
a woman’s age, general health, and preferences mayinfluence the choice of treatment. The exact location ofthe cancer within the cervix and the type of cervical can-cer also are important considerations.
Treatment of precancer and carcinoma in situ
Most low-grade SILs that are detected with Pap tests
revert to normal without treatment. Most high-gradeSILs require treatment. Treatments to remove precancer-ous cells include:
• cold knife cone biopsy
• LEEP
• cryosurgery (freezing the cells with a metal probe)• cauterization or diathermy (burning off the cells)• laser surgery (burning off the cells with a laser beam)
These methods also may be used to treat cancer that
is confined to the surface of the cervix (stage 0) and other
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 713Cervical cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 713"
"early-stage cervical cancers in women who may want to
become pregnant. They may be used in conjunction withother treatments. These procedures may cause bleedingor cramping. All of these treatments require close follow-up to detect any recurrence of the cancer.
Surgery
A simple hysterectomy is used to treat some stages
0 and IA cervical cancers. Usually only the uterus isremoved, although occasionally the fallopian tubes andovaries are removed as well. The tissues adjoining theuterus, including the vagina, remain intact. The uterusmay be removed either through the abdomen or thevagina.
In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus and adjoining
tissues, including the ovaries, the upper region (1 in) ofthe vagina near the cervix, and the pelvic lymph nodes,are all removed. A radical hysterectomy usually involvesabdominal surgery. However, it can be performed vagi-nally, in combination with a laparoscopic pelvic lymphnode dissection. With laparoscopy , a tube is inserted"
"through a very small surgical incision for the removal ofthe lymph nodes. These operations are used to treatstages IA2, IB, and IIA cervical cancers, particularly inyoung women. Following a hysterectomy, the tissue isexamined to see if the cancer has spread and requiresadditional radiation treatment. Women who have hadhysterectomies cannot become pregnant, but complica-tions from a hysterectomy are rare.
If cervical cancer recurs following treatment, a
pelvic exenteration (extensive surgery) may be per-formed. This includes a radical hysterectomy, with theadditional removal of the bladder, rectum, part of thecolon, and/or all of the vagina. Such operations requirethe creation of new openings for the urine and feces. Anew vagina may be created surgically. Often the clitorisand other outer genitals are left intact.
Recovery from a pelvic exenteration may take six"
"Recovery from a pelvic exenteration may take six
months to two years. This treatment is successful with40–50% of recurrent cervical cancers that are confined tothe pelvis. If the recurrent cancer has spread to otherorgans, radiation or chemotherapy may be used to alle-
viate some of the symptoms.
Radiation
Radiation therapy , which involves the use of high-
dosage x rays or other high-energy waves to kill cancercells, often is used for treating stages IB, IIA, and IIBcervical cancers, or in combination with surgery. Withexternal-beam radiation therapy, the rays are focused onthe pelvic area from a source outside the body. Withimplant or internal radiation therapy, a pellet of radioac-tive material is placed internally, near the tumor. Alterna-
tively, thin needles may be used to insert the radioactivematerial directly into the tumor.
Radiation therapy to the pelvic region can have
many side effects:
• skin reaction in the area of treatment• fatigue
• upset stomach and loose bowels"
"• skin reaction in the area of treatment• fatigue
• upset stomach and loose bowels
• vaginal stenosis (narrowing of the vagina due to build-
up of scar tissue) leading to painful sexual intercourse
• premature menopause in young women
• problems with urination
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy, the use of one or more drugs to kill
cancer cells, is used to treat disease that has spreadbeyond the cervix. Most often it is used followingsurgery or radiation treatment. Stages IIB, III, IV , andrecurrent cervical cancers usually are treated with acombination of external and internal radiation andchemotherapy. The common drugs used for cervicalcancer are cisplatin, ifosfamide, and fluorouracil. Thesemay be injected or taken by mouth. The National CancerInstitute recommends that chemotherapy with cisplatinbe considered for all women receiving radiation therapyfor cervical cancer.

• bleeding or anemia (low red blood cell count)
With the exception of menopause and infertility,
most of the side effects are temporary.

cers combined is about 70%. The death rate from cervicalcancer continues to decline by about 2% each year.Women over age 65 account for 40–50% of all deathsfrom cervical cancer.
Prevention
Viral infections
Most cervical cancers are preventable. More than
90% of women with cervical cancer are infected withHPV . HPV infection is the single most important riskfactor. This is particularly true for young women becausethe cells lining the cervix do not fully mature until age18. These immature cells are more susceptible to cancer-causing agents and viruses.

"Since HPV is a sexually-transmitted infection, sexu-
al behaviors can put women at risk for HPV infectionand cervical cancer. These behaviors include:
• sexual intercourse at age 16 or younger
• partners who began having intercourse at a young age
• multiple sexual partners
• sexual partners who have had multiple partners (“high-
risk males”)
• a partner who has had a previous sexual partner with
cervical cancer
HPV infection may not produce any symptoms, so
sexual partners may not know that they are infected.However, Pap tests can detect the infection. Condoms donot necessarily prevent HPV infection.
Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(AIDS ) is a risk factor for cervical cancer. Women who"
"test positive for HIV may have impaired immune sys-tems that cannot correct precancerous conditions. Fur-thermore, sexual behavior that puts women at risk forHIV infection, also puts them at risk for HPV infection.There is some evidence suggesting that another sexuallytransmitted virus, the genital herpes virus, also may be
involved in cervical cancer.
Smoking
Smoking may double the risk of cervical cancer.
Chemicals produced by tobacco smoke can damage theDNA of cervical cells. The risk increases with the numberof years a woman smokes and the amount she smokes.
Diet and drugs
Diets that are low in fruits and vegetables increase
the risk of cervical cancer. Women also have an increasedrisk of cervical cancer if their mothers took the drugdiethylstilbestrol (DES) while they were pregnant. Thisdrug was given to women between 1940 and 1971 to pre-vent miscarriages. Some statistical studies have suggest-ed that the long-term use of oral contraceptives may"
"slightly increase the risk of cervical cancer.
Pap tests
Most cases of cervical cancers are preventable,
since they start with easily detectable precancerouschanges. Therefore, the best prevention for cervical can-cer is a regular Pap test. When precancerous changes aredetected, appropriate treatment can prevent the develop-ment of invasive cancer. The ACS recommends thatwomen have annual Pap tests beginning when they firststart having sex or at age 18. Women who are pastmenopause or some women with hysterectomies contin-
ue to require Pap tests.
The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early
Detection Program provides free or low-cost Pap testsand treatment for women without health insurance, forolder women, and for members of racial and ethnicminorities. The program is administered through individ-ual states, under the direction of the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention.

"Special concerns
If a woman is diagnosed with very early-stage (IA)
cervical cancer while pregnant, the physician usually willrecommend a hysterectomy after the baby is born. Forlater-stage cancers, the pregnancy is terminated or the
baby is removed by cesarean section as soon as it can
survive outside the womb. This is followed by a hysterec-tomy and/or radiation treatment. For the most advancedstages of cervical cancer, treatment is initiated despitethe pregnancy.
Many women with cervical cancer have hysterec-
tomies, which are major surgeries. Although normalactivities, including sexual intercourse, can be resumedin four-eight weeks, a woman may have emotional prob-lems following a hysterectomy. A strong support systemcan help with these difficulties.

Cervical conization
Definition
Cervical conization is both a diagnostic and treat-
ment tool used to detect and treat abnormalities of thecervix. It is also known as a cone biopsy or cold knifecone biopsy.
Purpose
Cervical conization is performed if the results of a
cervical biopsy have found a precancerous condition in thecervix. The cervix is the small cylindrical organ at thelower part of the uterus, which separates the uterus fromthe vagina. Cervical conization also may be performed ifthere is an abnormal cervical smear test ( PAP test ). A
biopsy is a diagnostic test in which tissue or cells areremoved from the body and examined under a microscope,primarily to look for cancer or other abnormalities.
Precautions
As with any operation that is performed under gen-
eral anesthesia, the patient must not eat or drink anythingfor six to eight hours before surgery.
Description

"Description
The patient lies on the table with her legs raised in
stirrups, similar to the position when having a PAP test.KEY TERMS
Biopsy —The removal of a small piece of living tis-
sue for examination under a microscope.
PAP test —The short term for Papanicolaou test,
this procedure tests a smear of cellular materialscraped from the cervix and examined under amicroscope to detect abnormal cells.
The patient is given general anesthesia, and the vagina is
held open with an instrument called a speculum. Using ascalpel or laser the doctor removes a cone-shaped pieceof the cervix containing the area with abnormal cells.The resulting crater is repaired by stitching flaps of tissueover the wound. Alternatively, the wound may be leftopen, and heat or freezing is used to stop bleeding.
Once the tissue has been removed, it is examined"
"Once the tissue has been removed, it is examined
under a microscope for signs of cancer. If cancer is pre-sent, other tests will be needed. Surgery will be per-formed to remove the cervix and uterus ( hysterectomy )
and other treatments may be used as well. If the abnor-mal cells are precancerous, a laser can be used todestroy them.
Cold knife cone biopsy used to be the preferred
treatment for removing abnormal cells in the cervix.Now, most cone biopsies are performed using laser
surgery . Cold knife cone biopsy is generally used only
for special situations. For example, if a biopsy did notremove all the abnormal cells, the cold knife cone proce-dure allows the physician to remove what’s left.
Aftercare
An overnight stay in the hospital may be required.
After the test, the patient may feel some cramps or dis-comfort for about a week. Women should not have sex,use tampons, or douche until after seeing their physicianfor a follow up appointment (a week or more after theprocedure).
Risks"
"Risks
Because cone biopsies carry risks such as bleeding
and problems with subsequent pregnancies, they havebeen replaced with newer technologies except in a fewcircumstances.
About one in 10 women experience bleeding from
the vagina about two weeks after the biopsy. There isalso a slight risk of infection or perforation of the uterus.In a few women, the cervical canal becomes narrowed or

"completely blocked, which can later interfere with the
movement of sperm. This can impair a woman’s fertility.
If too much muscle tissue has been removed, the
procedure can lead to an incompetent cervix , which can
be a problem with subsequent pregnancies. An incompe-tent cervix cannot seal properly to maintain apregnancy . If untreated, the condition increases the odds
of miscarriage or premature labor .
Cervical conization also may temporarily alter cer-
vical cells, which can make a Pap smear test hard tointerpret accurately for three or four months.
Normal results
This procedure is only performed if an abnormality
is known or suspected.
Abnormal results
The presence of precancerous or cancerous cells in
the cervix.

Cervical disk disease
Definition
Cervical disk disease refers to a gradual deteriora-
tion of the spongy disks in the top part of the spine.
Description
The spine is made up of 33 bones called vertebrae
separated by spongy rings of elastic material. Theserings, known as disks, are often compared to shock"
"absorbers because they help to cushion the vertebrae.Just as importantly, they also make it possible to turn thehead and neck. Over time, these disks slowly becomeflattened and less elastic due to everyday wear and tear.When this process occurs in the disks of the neck, it isreferred to as cervical disk disease. Other general termsfor this process include degenerative disk disease andintervertebral disk disease.
Cervical disk disease affects everyone to some
degree, often without causing any bothersome symp-toms. However, this condition can also lead to specificproblems related to nerve functioning. For example, theouter edge of a disk may tear, allowing the gelatinousmaterial inside to bulge outward ( herniated disk ). This"
"can put pressure on nerves that exit the spine. Two adja-cent vertebrae may rub together (sometimes resulting inbone spurs) that can also pinch these nerves. In othercases, the inner part of the ring may push on the spinalcord itself, which passes through the disk. Any of thesesituations can cause pain and limit movement. While
symptoms primarily affect the neck, they can also occurin other parts of the body.
Causes and symptoms
Cervical disk disease is a gradual process that occurs
with aging , though poor posture, repeated lifting, and
tobacco use can hasten its course. Symptoms includepain when moving the neck and limited neck movement.The condition can also affect the hand, shoulder, and armresulting in pain, numbness/tingling, and weakness. Ifthe spinal cord itself is affected, these symptoms mayoccur in the legs. Loss of bowel or bladder control mayalso occur.

"Diagnosis
Cervical disk disease is typically diagnosed by an
orthopedist or a neurologist. After taking a medical his-tory and conducting a physical examination , the doctor
will recommend an imaging procedure to gather moreinformation about the nature of the problem. This mayinclude a CT scan, an MRI, or myelography . In addi-
tion, an electromyogram (EMG) may be used to evalu-ate the functioning of nerves in the arms, hands, or legs.Cervical disk disease is typically covered by medicalinsurance.
Treatment
Treatment usually involves physical therapy, several
weeks of drug therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflam-
matory drugs (NSAIDs), and limited use of a cervical
collar (to reduce neck movement). Neck traction and
heat treatments may also be recommended. In some

"cases, steroids or anesthetic drugs may be injected into
the spinal canal to help alleviate symptoms. Aside fromthese measures, maintaining good posture and placing apillow under the neck and head during sleep can be help-ful. Treatment may last anywhere from several weeks tothree months or more. Neck surgery is not usuallyadvised unless other therapies have failed.
Alternative treatment
Acupuncture , therapeutic massage, and yoga are
believed by some practitioners of alternative medicine tohave generalized pain-relieving effects. However, anytherapy that involves manipulating the neck is not recom-mended and should be approved by the primary doctorbeforehand.
Prognosis
In most people symptoms go away within three
months if not sooner. A smaller number may requiresurgery to correct the problem.
Prevention
While some degree of disk degeneration is inevitable,
people can reduce their risk by practicing good posture(during sitting, standing, and lifting), performing neck-KEY TERMS"

Cervical spondylosis
Definition
Cervical spondylosis refers to common age-related
changes in the area of the spine at the back of the neck.With age, the vertebrae (the component bones of thespine) gradually form bone spurs, and their shock-absorbing disks slowly shrink. These changes can alterthe alignment and stability of the spine. They may gounnoticed, or they may produce problems related to pres-sure on the spine and associated nerves and blood ves-sels. This pressure can cause weakness, numbness, andpain in various areas of the body. In severe cases, walk-

"Description
As it runs from the brain down the back, the spinal
cord is protected by ringlike bones, called vertebrae,stacked one upon the other. The vertebrae are not indirect contact with one another, however. The interven-ing spaces are filled with structures called disks. Thedisks are made up of a tough, fibrous outer tissue with aninner core of elastic or gel-like tissue.
One of the most important functions of disks is pro-
tecting the vertebrae and the nerves and blood vesselsbetween the vertebrae. The disks also lend flexibility to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 719Cervical spondylosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 719"
"the spinal cord, facilitating movements such as turning
the head or bending the neck. As people age, disks gradu-ally become tougher and more unyielding. Disks alsoshrink with age, which reduces the amount of paddingbetween the vertebrae.
As the amount of padding shrinks, the spine loses
stability. The vertebrae react by constructing osteo-phytes, commonly known as bone spurs. There are sevenvertebrae in the neck; development of osteophytes onthese bones is sometimes called cervical osteoarthritis .
Osteophytes may help to stabilize the degenerating back-bone and help protect the spinal cord.
By age 50, 25–50% of people develop cervical spondy-
losis; by 75 years of age, it is seen in at least 70% of people.Although shrunken vertebral disks, osteophyte growth, andother changes in their cervical spine may exist, many ofthese people never develop significant problems.

"However, about 50% of people over age 50 experience
neck pain and stiffness due to cervical spondylosis. Ofthese people, 25–40% have at least one episode of cervicalradiculopathy, a condition that arises when osteophytescompress nerves between the vertebrae. Another potentialproblem occurs if osteophytes, degenerating disks, or shift-ing vertebrae narrow the spinal canal. This pressure com-presses the spinal cord and its blood vessels, causing cervi-cal spondylitic myelopathy, a disorder in which large seg-ments of the spinal cord are damaged. This disorder affectsfewer than 5% of people with cervical spondylosis. Symp-toms of both cervical spondylitic myelopathy and cervicalradiculopathy may be present in some people.

"Causes and symptoms
As people age, shrinkage of the vertebral disks
prompts the vertebrae to form osteophytes to stabilize theback bone. However, the position and alignment of thedisks and vertebrae may shift despite the osteophytes.Symptoms may arise from problems with one or moredisks or vertebrae.
Osteophyte formation and other changes do not nec-
essarily lead to symptoms, but after age 50, half of thepopulation experiences occasional neck pain and stiff-ness. As disks degenerate, the cervical spine becomesless stable, and the neck is more vulnerable to injuries,including muscle and ligament strains. Contact betweenthe edges of the vertebrae can also cause pain. In somepeople, this pain may be referred—that is, perceived asoccurring in the head, shoulders, or chest, rather than theneck. Other symptoms may include vertigo (a type ofdizziness ) or ringing in the ears.
The neck pain and stiffness can be intermittent, as"
"The neck pain and stiffness can be intermittent, as
can symptoms of radiculopathy. Radiculopathy refers tocompression on the base, or root, of nerves that leadaway from the spinal cord. Normally, these nerves fit
comfortably through spaces between the vertebrae.These spaces are called intervertebral foramina. As theosteophytes form, they can impinge on this area andgradually make the fit between the vertebrae too snug.
The poor fit increases the chances that a minor inci-
dent, such as overdoing normal activities, may placeexcess pressure on the nerve root, sometimes referred toas a pinched nerve. Pressure may also accumulate as adirect consequence of osteophyte formation. The pres-sure on the nerve root causes severe shooting pain in theneck, arms, shoulder, and/or upper back, depending onwhich nerve roots of the cervical spine are affected. Thepain is often aggravated by movement, but in most cases,symptoms resolve within four-six weeks."
"Cervical spondylosis can cause cervical spondylitic
myelopathy through stenosis- or osteophyte-related pres-sure on the spinal cord. Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of
the spinal canal—the area through the center of the verte-bral column occupied by the spinal cord. Stenosis occursbecause of misaligned vertebrae and out-of-place ordegenerating disks. The problems created by spondylosiscan be exacerbated if a person has a naturally narrowspinal canal. Pressure against the spinal cord can also becreated by osteophytes forming on the inner surface ofvertebrae and pushing against the spinal cord. Stenosis orosteophytes can compress the spinal cord and its bloodvessels, impeding or choking off needed nutrients to thespinal cord cells; in effect, the cells starve to death .

"With the death of these cells, the functions that they
once performed are impaired. These functions mayinclude conveying sensory information to the brain ortransmitting the brain’s commands to voluntary muscles.Pain is usually absent, but a person may experience legnumbness and an inability to make the legs move proper-ly. Other symptoms can include clumsiness and weaknessin the hands, stiffness and weakness in the legs, and spon-taneous twitches in the legs. A person’s ability to walk isaffected, and a wide-legged, shuffling gait is sometimesadopted to compensate for the lack of sensation in thelegs and the accompanying, realistic fear of falling.

Cervical spondylosis is often suspected based on the
symptoms and their history. Careful neurological exami-nation can help determine which nerve roots are involved,based on the location of the pain and numbness, and thepattern of weakness and changes in reflex responses. Toconfirm the suspected diagnosis, and to rule out otherpossibilities, imaging tests are ordered. The first test is anx ray. X rays reveal the presence of osteophytes, stenosis,

ment in the cervical spine—in short, an x ray confirmsthat a person has cervical spondylosis. To demonstratethat the condition is causing the symptoms, more detailsare needed. Other imaging tests, such as magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography myel-
ography , help assess effects of cervical spondylosis on
associated nerve tissue and blood vessels.
An MRI may be preferred, because it is a noninva-
sive procedure and does not require injecting a contrastmedium as does computed tomography myelography.MRIs also have greater sensitivity for detecting diskproblems and spinal cord involvement, and the testallows the physician to create images of a larger areafrom various angles.

tional medical treatment, but it can be a useful adjunct. Itsmain roles are to relieve tension, manage pain, andstrengthen neck and back muscles. Massage is one way torelieve tension, and yoga provides the additional benefit
of strengthening muscles. Chiropractic and acupunc-
ture have been reported to relieve the pain associated"
"ture have been reported to relieve the pain associated
with disk problems, although great care needs to be takento avoid exacerbating them. Practitioners of the Alexan-
der technique or the Feldenkrais method can provide
instruction on correct posture and exercise that may help
prevent further symptoms. Vitamin and mineral supple-mentation along with herbal therapies and homeopathy
can help build and rebalance the weakened structure.
Prognosis
The gradual progression of cervical spondylosis
cannot be stopped; however, it doesn’t always causesymptoms. For the individuals who do experience prob-
lems, conservative treatment is very effective in manag-ing the symptoms. Nearly all people with neck pain,approximately 75% of persons with radiculopathy, andup to 50% of people with myelopathy find relief throughtherapy alone. For the remaining people with radiculopa-thy or myelopathy, surgery may be recommended.Surgery is deemed successful in 70–80% of cases.
Prevention"
"Prevention
Since cervical spondylosis is part of the normal
aging process, not much can be done to prevent it. It may
be possible to ward off some or all of the symptoms byengaging in regular physical exercise and limiting occu-pational or recreational activities that place pressure onthe head, neck, and shoulders. The best exercises for thehealth of the cervical spine are noncontact activities,such as swimming, walking, or yoga. Once symptomshave already developed, the emphasis is on symptommanagement rather than prevention.

Cervicitis
Definition
Cervicitis is an inflammation of the cervix.
Description
Cervicitis is a inflammation of the cervix (the open-
ing into the uterus). This inflammation can be chronicand may or may not have an identified cause.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 722CervicitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 722"
"Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of cervicitis is infection,
either local or as a result of various sexually transmitted
diseases , such as chlamydia or gonorrhea . Cervicitis
can also be caused by birth control devices such as a cer-vical cap or diaphragm, or chemical exposure. Other riskfactors include multiple sexual partners or cervical trau-ma following birth. In postmenopausal women, cervicitisis sometimes related to a lack of estrogen.
Although a woman may not notice any signs of
infection, symptoms of cervicitis include the following:
• persistent unusual vaginal discharge
• abnormal bleeding, either between periods or following
sexual intercourse
• painful sexual intercourse
• vaginal pain
• frequent need to urinate
• burning or itching in the vaginal area
Diagnosis
The standard method of diagnosing cervicitis is
through a pelvic examination or a Pap smear. During thepelvic exam , the physician usually swabs the affected"
"area, and then sends the tissue sample to a laboratory.The laboratory tries to identify the specific organismresponsible for causing the cervicitis. A biopsy to take asample of tissue from the affected area is sometimesrequired in order to rule out cancer . Colposcopy , a pro-
cedure used to look at the cervix under a microscope,may also be used to rule out cancer.
Treatment
The first course of treatment for cervicitis is usually
antibiotics . If these medicines do not cure the cervicitis,
other treatment options include:
• Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP)
• cryotherapyKEY TERMS
Cryotherapy —Freezing the affected tissue.
Electrocoagulation —Using electrical current to
cauterize the affected tissue.

"• laser treatment
Prognosis
Cervicitis will usually be cured when the course of
therapy is complete. Severe cases, however, may last fora few months, even after the therapy is complete. If thecervicitis was caused by a sexually transmitted disease,both partners should be treated with medication.
Prevention
Practicing safe sexual behavior, such as monogamy,
is one way of lowering the prevalence of cervicitis. Inaddition, women who began sexual activity at a later agehave been shown to have a lower incidence of cervicitis.Another recommendation is to use a latex condom con-
sistently during intercourse. If the cervicitis is caused byany sexually transmitted disease, the patient is advised tonotify all sexual partners.

Cesarean section
Definition
A cesarean section is a surgical procedure in which
incisions are made through a woman’s abdomen anduterus to deliver her baby.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 723Cesarean sectionGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 723"
"Purpose
Cesarean sections, also called c-sections, are per-
formed whenever abnormal conditions complicate laborand vaginal delivery, threatening the life or health of themother or the baby. The procedure is performed in theUnited States on nearly one of every four babies deliv-ered—more than 900,000 babies each year. The proce-dure is often used in cases where the mother has had aprevious c-section. Dystocia, or difficult labor, is theother common cause of c-sections.
Difficult labor is commonly caused by one of the
three following conditions: abnormalities in the mother’sbirth canal; abnormalities in the position of the fetus; orabnormalities in the labor, including weak or infrequentcontractions.
Another major factor is fetal distress, a condition"
"Another major factor is fetal distress, a condition
where the fetus is not getting enough oxygen. Fetal braindamage can result from oxygen deprivation. Fetal dis-tress is often related to abnormalities in the position ofthe fetus or abnormalities in the birth canal, causingreduced blood flow through the placenta. Other condi-tions also can make c-section advisable, such as vaginalherpes, hypertension, and diabetes in the mother.Precautions

"There are several ways that obstetricians and other
doctors diagnose conditions that may make a c-sectionnecessary. Ultrasound testing reveals the positions of thebaby and the placenta and may be used to estimate thebaby’s size and gestational age. Fetal heart monitors, inuse since the 1970s, transmit any signals of fetal distress.Oxygen deprivation may be determined by checking theamniotic fluid for meconium (feces)—a lack of oxygencauses an unborn baby to defecate. Oxygen deprivationmay also be determined by testing the pH of a bloodsample taken from the baby’s scalp; a pH of 7.25 or high-er is normal, between 7.2 and 7.25 is suspicious, andbelow 7.2 is a sign of trouble.
When a c-section is being considered because labor
is not progressing, the mother should first be encouragedto walk around to stimulate labor. Labor may also bestimulated with the drug oxytocin.

"of the baby, and the type of breech position the baby is
in. However, a c-section is safer than a vaginal deliverywhen the baby is 8 lb (3.6 kg) or larger, in a breech posi-tion with the feet crossed, or in a breech position with thehead hyperextended.
A woman should receive regular prenatal care and
be able to alert her doctor to the first signs of trouble.Once labor begins, she should be encouraged to movearound and to urinate. The doctor should be conservativein diagnosing dystocia (nonprogressive labor) and fetaldistress, taking a position of “watchful waiting” beforedeciding to operate.

"Description
The most common reason that a cesarean section is
performed (in 35% of all cases, according to the UnitedStates Public Health Service) is that the woman has had aprevious c-section. The “once a cesarean, always a cesare-an” rule originated when the classical uterine incision wasmade vertically; the resulting scar was weak and had a riskof rupturing in subsequent deliveries. Today, the incision isalmost always made horizontally across the lower end ofthe uterus (this is called a “low transverse incision”),resulting in reduced blood loss and a decreased chance ofrupture. This kind of incision allows many women to havea vaginal birth after a cesarean (VBAC).
The second most common reason that a c-section is
performed (in 30% of all cases) is difficult childbirth
due to nonprogressive labor (dystocia). Uterine contrac-KEY TERMS

Classical incision —In a cesarean section, an incision

Dystocia —Failure to progress in labor, either
because the cervix will not dilate (expand) furtheror (after full dilation) the head does not descendthrough the mother’s pelvis.
Low transverse incision —Incision made horizontal-

"In 9% of all cases, c-sections are performed in
response to fetal distress. Fetal distress refers to any situ-ation that threatens the baby, such as the umbilical cordgetting wrapped around the baby’s neck. This mayappear on the fetal heart monitor as an abnormal heartrate or rhythm.
The remaining 14% of c-sections are indicated by
other serious factors. One is prolapse of the umbilicalcord: the cord is pushed into the vagina ahead of the babyand becomes compressed, cutting off blood flow to thebaby. Another is placental abruption : the placenta sepa-
rates from the uterine wall before the baby is born, cut-ting off blood flow to the baby. The risk of this is espe-cially high in multiple births (twins, triplets, or more). Athird factor is placenta previa : the placenta covers the"
"cervix partially or completely, making vaginal deliveryimpossible. In some cases requiring c-section, the baby isin a transverse position, lying horizontally across thepelvis, perhaps with a shoulder in the birth canal.
The mother’s health may make delivery by c-section
the safer choice, especially in cases of maternal diabetes,

"hypertension, genital herpes , Rh blood incompatibility,
and preeclampsia (high blood pressure related to preg-
nancy ).
Preparation
When a c-section becomes necessary, the mother is
prepped for surgery. A catheter is inserted into her blad-der and an intravenous (IV) line is inserted into her arm.Leads for monitoring the mother’s heart rate, rhythm,and blood pressure are attached. In the operating room,the mother is given anesthesia—usually a regional anes-thetic (epidural or spinal), making her numb from belowher breasts to her toes. In some cases, a general anesthet-ic will be administered. Surgical drapes are placed overthe body, except the head; these drapes block the directview of the procedure.
The abdomen is washed with an anti-bacterial solu-"
"The abdomen is washed with an anti-bacterial solu-
tion and a portion of the pubic hair may be shaved. Thefirst incision opens the abdomen. Infrequently, it will bevertical from just below the navel to the top of the pubicbone, or more commonly, it will be a horizontal incisionacross and above the pubic bone (informally called a“bikini cut”).
The second incision opens the uterus. In most cases
a transverse incision is made. This is the favored typebecause it heals well and makes it possible for a womanto attempt a vaginal delivery in the future. The classicalincision is vertical. Because it provides a larger openingthan a low transverse incision, it is used in the most criti-cal situations, such as placenta previa. However, the clas-sical incision causes more bleeding, a greater risk ofabdominal infection, and a weaker scar, so the low trans-verse incision is preferred.
Once the uterus is opened, the amniotic sac is rup-"
"Once the uterus is opened, the amniotic sac is rup-
tured and the baby is delivered. The time from the initialincision to birth is typically five minutes.
Once the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the new-
born is evaluated. The placenta is removed from themother, and her uterus and abdomen are stitched closed(surgical staples may be used instead in closing the outer-most layer of the abdominal incision). From birth throughsuturing may take 30–40 minutes. Thus the entire surgicalprocedure may be performed in less than one hour.
Aftercare
A woman who undergoes a c-section requires both
the care given to any new mother and the care given toany patient recovering from major surgery. She should beoffered pain medication that does not interfere with
breastfeeding. She should be encouraged to get out of bedand walk around eight to 24 hours after surgery to stimu-late circulation (thus avoiding the formation of blood"
"clots) and bowel movement. She should limit climbingstairs to once a day, and avoid lifting anything heavierthan the baby. She should nap as often as the baby sleeps,and arrange for help with the housework, meals, and careof other children. She may resume driving after twoweeks, although some doctors recommend waiting for sixweeks, the typical recovery period from major surgery.
Risks
Because a c-section is a surgical procedure, it carries
more risk to both the mother and the baby. The maternaldeath rate is less than 0.02%, but that is four times the"
"maternal death rate associated with vaginal delivery.However, many women have a c-section for serious med-ical problems. The mother is at risk for increased bleeding(because a c-section may result in twice the blood loss ofa vaginal delivery) from the two incisions, the placentalattachment site, and possible damage to a uterine artery.Complications occur in less than 10% of cases. The moth-er may develop infection of either incision, the urinarytract, or the tissue lining the uterus (endometritis). Lesscommonly, she may receive injury to the surroundingorgans, like the bladder and bowel. When a general anes-thesia is used, she may experience complications from theanesthesia. Very rarely, she may develop a woundhematoma at the site of either incision or other blood clotsleading to pelvic thrombophlebitis (inflammation of the
major vein running from the pelvis into the leg) or a pul-monary embolus (a blood clot lodging in the lung).
Normal results"
"Normal results
The after-effects of a c-section vary, depending on
the woman’s age, physical fitness, and overall health.Following this procedure, a woman commonly experi-ences gas pains, incision pain, and uterine contractions—which are also common in vaginal delivery. Her hospitalstay may be two to four days. Breastfeeding the baby isencouraged, taking care that it is in a position that keepsthe baby from resting on the mother’s incision. As thewoman heals, she may gradually increase appropriateexercises to regain abdominal tone. Full recovery may beseen in four to six weeks.
The prognosis for a successful vaginal birth after a
cesarean (VBAC) may be at least 75%, especially when thec-section involved a low transverse incision in the uterusand there were no complications during or after delivery.

"die from serious infections, hemorrhaging, or other com-
plications. These deaths may be related to the health con-ditions that made the operation necessary, and not simplyto the operation itself.
Undergoing a c-section may also inflict psychologi-
cal distress on the mother, beyond hormonal moodswings and postpartum depression (“baby blues”). The"
"woman may feel disappointment and a sense of failurefor not experiencing a vaginal delivery. She may feel iso-lated if the father or birthing coach is not with her in theoperating room, or if she is treated by an unfamiliar doc-tor rather than by her own doctor or midwife. She mayfeel helpless from a loss of control over labor and deliv-ery with no opportunity to actively participate. To over-come these feelings, the woman must understand whythe c-section was necessary. She must accept that shecouldn’t control the unforeseen events that made the c-section the optimum means of delivery, and recognizethat preserving the health and safety of both her and herchild was more important than her delivering vaginally.Women who undergo a c-section should be encouragedto share their feelings with others. Hospitals can oftenrecommend support groups for such mothers. Womenshould also be encouraged to seek professional help ifnegative emotions persist.

Chagas’ disease
Definition
Chagas’ disease is named after Dr. Carlos Chagas
who first found the organism in the early 1900s. Itinvolves damage to the nerves that control the heart,digestive and other organs, and eventually leads to dam-age to these organs. Worldwide, Chagas’ disease affectsover 15 million persons, and kills 50,000 each year.Researchers believe that the parasite that causes the dis-ease is only found in the Americas.
Description
When a person is infected with Chagas’ disease, the
parasite known as Trypanosoma cruzi first causes a mild,
short-lived period of “acute” illness; then after a longperiod without symptoms, the effects of the infectionbegin to appear. The heart, esophagus, and colon aremost frequently involved. These organs become unableto contract properly, and begin to stretch or dilate."
"Causes and symptoms
T. cruzi is carried by insects or bugs known as redu-
viid or “kissing bugs.” These insects are very common inCentral and South America where they inhabit poorlyconstructed houses and huts. The insects deposit theirwaste material, exposing inhabitants to the parasites. Theparasites then enter the body by way of a cut or via theeyes or mouth. T. cruzi can also be transmitted by blood
transfusion . Eating uncooked, contaminated food or
breastfeeding can also transmit the disease. The reduvi-ids, in turn, become infected with the parasite by bitinginfected animals and humans.
There are three phases related to infection:
• Acute phase lasts about two months, with non-specific
symptoms of low grade fever ,headache ,fatigue , and
enlarged liver or spleen.
• Indeterminate phase lasts 10–20 years, during which
time no symptoms occur, but the parasites are repro-ducing in various organs.
• Chronic phase is the stage when symptoms related to"
"• Chronic phase is the stage when symptoms related to
damage of major organs (heart, esophagus, colon) begin.
In the chronic phase, irregularities of heart rhythm,
heart failure , and blood clots cause weakness, fainting ,
and even sudden death .
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 727Chagas’ diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 727"
"Esophageal symptoms are related to difficulty with
swallowing and chest pain . Because the esophagus does
not empty properly, food regurgitates into the lungs caus-ing cough ,bronchitis , and repeated bouts of pneumo-
nia. Inability to eat, weight loss, and malnutrition
become a significant factor in affecting survival.
Involvement of the large intestine (colon) causes
constipation , distention, and abdominal pain.
Diagnosis
The best way to diagnose acute infection is to identi-
fy the parasites in tissue or blood. Occasionally it is pos-sible to culture the organism from infected tissue, but thisprocess usually requires too much time to be of value. Inthe chronic phase, antibody levels can be measured.Efforts to develop new, more accurate tests are ongoing.
Treatment
In most cases treatment of symptoms is all that is
possible. Present medications can reduce the durationand severity of an acute infection, but are only 50%effective, at best, in eliminating the organisms."
"Cardiac effects are managed with pacemakers and
medications. Esophageal complications require eitherendoscopic or surgical methods to improve esophagealemptying, similar to those used to treat the disorderknown as achalasia . Constipation is treated by increas-
ing fiber and bulk laxatives , or removal of diseased por-
tions of the colon.KEY TERMS
Achalasia —An esophageal disease of unknown
cause, in which the lower sphincter or muscle isunable to relax normally, and leads to the accu-mulation of material within the esophagus.
Endoscopy —Exam using an endoscope (a thin
flexible tube which uses a lens or miniature cam-era to view various areas of the gastrointestinaltract). When the procedure is performed to exam-ine certain organs such as the bile ducts or pan-creas, the organs are not viewed directly, butrather indirectly through the injection of x ray.
Parasite —An organism that lives on or in another
and takes nourishment (food and fluids) from thatorganism."
"and takes nourishment (food and fluids) from thatorganism.
Regurgitation —Flow of material back up the
esophagus and into the throat or lungs.Prognosis
Those patients with gastrointestinal complications
often respond to some form of treatment. Cardiac prob-lems are more difficult to treat, particularly since trans-plant would rekindle infection.
Prevention
Visitors traveling to areas of known infection should
avoid staying in mud, adobe, or similar huts. Mosquitonets and insect repellents are useful in helping to avoidcontact with the bugs. Blood screening is not alwayseffective in many regions where infection is common. Itis necessary to carefully screen people who have emi-grated from Central and South America before they makeblood donations.

Chancroid
Definition
Chancroid is a sexually transmitted disease caused
by a bacterial infection that is characterized by painfulsores on the genitals.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 728ChancroidGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 728"
"Description
Chancroid is an infection of the genitals that is
caused by the bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi . Chan-
croid is a sexually transmitted disease, which means thatit is spread from person to person almost always by sexu-al contact. However, there have been a few cases inwhich healthcare providers have become infectedthrough contact with infected patients.
Common locations for chancroid sores (ulcers) in
men are the shaft or head of the penis, foreskin, thegroove behind the head of the penis, the opening of thepenis, and the scrotum. In women, common locations arethe labia majora (outer lips), labia minora (inner lips),perianal area (area around the anal opening), and innerthighs. It is rare for the ulcer(s) to be on the vaginal wallsor cervix. In about 50% of the patients with chancroid,the infection spreads to either or both of the lymph nodesin the groin.
Chancroid is most commonly found in developing"
"Chancroid is most commonly found in developing
and third world countries. In the United States, the mostcommon cause of genital ulcers is genital herpes , fol-
lowed by syphilis , and then chancroid. As of 1997, there
were fewer than 1,500 cases of chancroid in the UnitedStates per year and it occurred primarily in AfricanAmericans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans.There are occasional localized outbreaks of chancroid inthe United States. In addition, the practice of exchangingsex for drugs has lead to a link between crack cocaine
use and chancroid.
Even though the incidence of chancroid in the United
States decreased in the 1990s, there is an alarming con-nection between chancroid and human immunodeficien-
cyvirus (HIV) infection. HIV causes AIDS (acquired"
"cyvirus (HIV) infection. HIV causes AIDS (acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome) and is easily spread fromperson to person through chancroid ulcers. Uncircum-cised men with chancroid ulcers have a 48% risk ofacquiring HIV from sexual contact. Women with chan-croid ulcers are also at a greater risk of being infectedwith HIV during sexual contact. Genital ulcers seem toact as doorways for HIV to enter and exit.
Causes and symptoms
Haemophilus ducreyi is spread from person to per-
son by vaginal, anal, and oral sexual contact. Uncircum-cised men are about three times more likely than circum-cised men to become infected following exposure toHaemophilus ducreyi . Having unprotected sex, exchang-
ing sex for drugs, and having unprotected sex with aprostitute are other risk factors. Many cases of chancroidin the United States occur in persons who had traveled tocountries where the disease is more common.Chancroid occurs when Haemophilus ducreyi pene-"
"trates the skin through an injury, like a scratch or cut.Once past the skin surface, the warmth, moisture, andnutrients allow bacteria to grow rapidly. The first sign ofchancroid is a small, red papule that occurs within threeto seven days following exposure to the bacteria, but maytake up to one month. Usually within one day, the papulebecomes an ulcer. The chancroid ulcer is painful, bleedseasily, drains a grey or yellowish pus, and has sharplydefined, ragged edges. They can vary in size from aneighth of an inch to two inches in diameter. Men usuallyhave only one ulcer, but women often have four or more.Sometimes “kissing” ulcers occur when one ulcerspreads the bacterial infection to an opposite skin sur-face. For example, kissing ulcers can form on the lips ofthe labia majora. Alternatively, women may not have anyexternal sores but may experience painful urination,intercourse, and/or bowel movements and may have avaginal discharge or rectal bleeding."
"Signs that the infection has spread to the lymph node
appear about one week after the formation of the genitalulcer. Lymph nodes are small organs in the lymphaticsystem that filter waste materials from nearly everyorgan in the body. This lymph node infection is called“lymphadenitis” and the swollen, painful lymph node iscalled a “bubo.” The bubo, which appears as a red, spher-ical lump, may burst through the skin, releasing a thickpus and forming another ulcer.
Diagnosis
Chancroid may be diagnosed and treated by urolo-
gists (urinary tract doctors for men), gynecologists (forwomen), and infectious disease specialists. Part of thediagnosis of chancroid involves ruling out genital herpesand syphilis because genital ulcers are also symptoms ofthese diseases. The appearance of these three diseases

"can be close enough to be confusing. However, the pres-
ence of a pus-filled lump in the groin of a patient with agenital ulcer is highly specific for chancroid.
For a clear-cut diagnosis of chancroid, Haemophilus
ducreyi must be isolated from the ulcer. To do this, a ster-
ile cotton swab is wiped over the ulcer to obtain a pussample. In the laboratory, the sample is put into specialmedia and placed in an incubator. Haemophilus ducreyi
takes from two to five days to grow in the laboratory. Inaddition, the pus may be examined under the microscopeto see which bacteria are in the ulcer. A sample of the pusmay also be tested to see if the herpes virus is present. Ablood sample will probably be taken from the patient’sarm to test for the presence of antibodies to the bacteriathat causes syphilis.
Treatment
The only treatment for chancroid is antibiotics given"
"Treatment
The only treatment for chancroid is antibiotics given
either once or for several days. Antibiotics taken by mouthfor one to two weeks include erythromycin (E-Mycin,Ery-Tab), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (Augmentin),co-trimoxazole (Bactrim, Septra), or ciprofloxacin(Cipro). Antibiotics given in one dose include ceftriaxone(Rocephin), spectinomycin (Trobicin), co-trimoxazole, orofloxacin (Floxin).
The ulcer(s) may be cleaned and soaked to reduce
the swelling. Salt solution dressings may be applied tothe ulcer(s) to reduce the spread of the bacteria and pre-vent additional ulcers. A serious infection of the foreskinmay require circumcision . Pus would be removed from
infected lymph nodes by using a needle and syringe.Very large buboes may require surgical drainage.
Prognosis
Without treatment, chancroid may either go away"
"Prognosis
Without treatment, chancroid may either go away
quickly or patients may experience the painful ulcers formany months. A complete cure is obtained with antibiotictreatment. Severe ulcers may cause permanent scars.Severe scarring of the foreskin may require circumcision.Urethral fistulas (abnormal passageways from the urinetube to the skin) may occur and requires corrective surgery.KEY TERMS
Bubo —A tender, swollen lymph node in the groin
that may follow a chancroid ulcer.
Groin —The region of the body that lies between
the abdomen and the thighs.Prevention
The best prevention for chancroid is to use a con-
dom during sexual intercourse. Chancroid can also be
prevented by abstinence (avoidance of any sexual con-tact) and by being in a monogamous relationship with adisease-free partner. To prevent the spread of chancroid,it is important that all sexual contacts of the patient areidentified and treated.

Charcoal, activated
Definition
Activated charcoal is a fine, black, odorless, and
tasteless powder. It is made from wood or other materialsthat have been exposed to very high temperatures in anairless environment. It is then treated, or activated, toincrease its ability to adsorb by reheating with oxidizinggas or other chemicals to break it into a very fine powder.Activated charcoal is pure carbon specially processed tomake it highly adsorbent of particles and gases in thebody’s digestive system.
Activated charcoal has often been used since ancient
times to cure a variety of ailments including poisoning .

"Its healing effects have been well documented since as
early as 1550 B.C. by the Egyptians. However, charcoal
was almost forgotten until 15 years ago when it wasrediscovered as a wonderful oral agent to treat most over-doses and toxins.
Description
Activated charcoal’s most important use is for treat-
ment of poisoning. It helps prevent the absorption ofmost poisons or drugs by the stomach and intestines. Inaddition to being used for most swallowed poisons inhumans, charcoal has been effectively used in dogs, rab-bits, rats, and other animals, as well. It can also adsorbgas in the bowels and has been used for the treatment ofgas or diarrhea . Charcoal’s other uses such as treatment
of viruses, bacteria, bacterial toxic byproducts, snakevenoms and other substances by adsorption have notbeen supported by clinical studies. By adding water tothe powder to make a paste, activated charcoal can beused as an external application to alleviate pain and itch-
ingfrom bites and stings ."
"ingfrom bites and stings .
Poisons and drug overdoses
It is estimated that one million children accidentally"
"overdose on drugs mistaken as candies or eat, drink, orinhale poisonous household products each year. Infantsand toddlers are at the greatest risk for accidental poison-ing. Activated charcoal is one of the agents most com-monly used for these cases. It can absorb large amounts ofpoisons quickly. In addition, it is non-toxic, may be storedfor a long time, and can be conveniently administered athome. Charcoal works by binding to irritating or toxicsubstances in the stomach and intestines. This preventsthe toxic drug or chemical from spreading throughout thebody. The activated charcoal with the toxic substancebound to it is then excreted in the stool without harm tothe body. When poisoning is suspected the local poisoncontrol center should be contacted for instructions. Theymay recommend using activated charcoal, which shouldbe available at home so that it can be given to the poi-soned child or pet immediately. For severe poisoning,several doses of activated charcoal may be needed."
"Intestinal disorders
In the past, activated charcoal was a popular remedy
for gas. Even before the discovery of America by Euro-peans, Native Americans used powdered charcoal mixedwith water to treat an upset stomach. Now charcoal isbeing rediscovered as an alternative treatment for this con-dition. Activated charcoal works like a sponge. Its hugesurface area is ideal for soaking up different substances,including gas. In one study, people taking activated char-KEY TERMS

coal after eating a meal with high gas-producing foods did
not produce more gas than those who did not have thesefoods. Charcoal has also been used to treat other intestinaldisorders such as diarrhea, constipation , and cramps."
"There are few studies to support these uses and there arealso concerns that frequent use of charcoal may decreaseabsorption of essential nutrients, especially in children.
Other uses
Besides being a general antidote for poisons or reme-
dy for gas, activated charcoal has been used to treat otherconditions as well. Based on its ability to adsorb or bindto other substances, charcoal has been effectively used toclean skin wounds and to adsorb waste materials from the
gastrointestinal tract. In addition, it has been used toadsorb snake venoms, viruses, bacteria, and harmfulmaterials excreted by bacteria or fungi. However, becauseof lack of scientific studies, these uses are not recom-mended. Activated charcoal, when used together withother remedies such as aloe vera, acidophilus, and psylli-um, helps to keep symptoms of ulcerative colitis under
control. While charcoal shows some anti-aging activity inrats, it is doubtful if it can do the same for humans.
Recommended dosage

"Recommended dosage
For poisoning
Activated charcoal is available without prescription.
However, in case of accidental poisoning or drug overdose
an emergency poison control center, hospital emergencyroom, or doctor’s office should be called for advice. In casethat both syrup of ipecac and charcoal are recommended
for treatment of the poison, ipecac should be given first.Charcoal should not be given for at least 30 minutes afteripecac or until vomiting from ipecac stops. Activated char-coal is often mixed with a liquid before being swallowed orput into the tube leading to the stomach. Activated charcoalis available as 1.1 oz (33 ml) liquid bottles. It is also avail-able in 0.5 oz (15 ml) container sizes and as slurry of char-coal pre-mixed in water or as a container in which water orsoda pop is added. Keeping activated charcoal at home is a

"good idea so that it can be taken immediately when needed
for treatment of poisoning.
For acute poisoning, the dosage is as follows:
• Infants (under 1 year of age): 1 g/kg.• Children (1–12 years of age): 15–30 g or 1–2 g/kg with
at least 8 oz of water.
• Adults: 30–100 g or 1–2 g/kg with at least 8 oz of water.
For diarrhea or gas
A person can take charcoal tablets or capsules with
water or sprinkle the content onto foods. The dosage fortreatment of gas or diarrhea in adults is 520–975 mg aftereach meal and up to 5 g per day.
Precautions
Parents should keep activated charcoal on hand in
case of emergencies.
Do not give charcoal together with syrup of ipecac.
The charcoal will adsorb the ipecac. Charcoal should betaken 30 minutes after ipecac or after the vomiting fromipecac stops.
Some activated charcoal products contain sorbitol.
Sorbitol is a sweetener as well as a laxative, therefore, itmay cause severe diarrhea and vomiting. These productsshould not be used in infants."
"Charcoal may interfere with the absorption of med-
ications and nutrients such as vitamins or minerals . For
uses other than for treatment of poisoning, charcoalshould be taken two hours after other medications.
Charcoal should not be used to treat poisoning
caused by corrosive products such as lye or other strongacids or petroleum products such as gasoline, kerosene,or cleaning fluids. Charcoal may make the conditionworse and delay diagnosis and treatment. In addition,charcoal is also not effective if the poison is lithium,cyanide, iron, ethanol, or methanol.
Parents should not mix charcoal with chocolate
syrup, sherbet, or ice cream, even though it may makecharcoal taste better. These foods may prevent charcoalfrom working properly.

Charcot Marie Tooth disease
Definition
Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) is the name
of a group of inherited disorders of the nerves in theperipheral nervous system (nerves throughout the body

"that communicate motor and sensory information to and
from the spinal cord) causing weakness and loss of sen-sation in the limbs.
Description
CMT is named for the three neurologists who first
described the condition in the late 1800s. It is also knownas hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, and is some-times called peroneal muscular atrophy, referring to themuscles in the leg that are often affected. The age of onsetof CMT can vary anywhere from young childhood to the50s or 60s. Symptoms typically begin by the age of 20. Forreasons yet unknown, the severity in symptoms can alsovary greatly, even among members of the same family.
Although CMT has been described for many years,
it is only since the early 1990s that the genetic cause ofmany of the types of CMT have become known. There-fore, knowledge about CMT has increased dramaticallywithin a short time.
The peripheral nerves

"The peripheral nerves
CMT affects the peripheral nerves, those groups of
nerve cells carrying information to and from the spinalcord. CMT decreases the ability of these nerves to carrymotor commands to muscles, especially those furthestfrom the spinal cord located in the feet and hands. As aresult, the muscles connected to these nerves eventuallyweaken. CMT also affects the sensory nerves that carryinformation from the limbs to the brain. Therefore peo-ple with CMT also have sensory loss. This causes symp-toms such as not being able to tell if something is hot orcold or difficulties with balance.
There are two parts of the nerve that can be affected"
"There are two parts of the nerve that can be affected
in CMT. A nerve can be likened to an electrical wire, inwhich the wire part is the axon of the nerve and the insu-lation surrounding it is the myelin sheath. The job of themyelin is to help messages travel very fast through thenerves. CMT is usually classified depending on whichpart of the nerve is affected. People who have problemswith the myelin have CMT type 1 and people who haveabnormalities of the axon have CMT type 2.
Specialized testing of the nerves, called nerve con-
duction testing (NCV), can be performed to determine ifa person has CMT1 or CMT2. These tests measure thespeed at which messages travel through the nerves. InCMT1, the messages move too slowly, but in CMT2 themessages travel at the normal speed.
Demographics
CMT has been diagnosed in people from all over the
world. It occurs in approximately one in 2,500 people,which is about the same incidence as multiple sclerosis . It"
"is the most common type of inherited neurologic condition.
Signs and symptoms
CMT is caused by changes (mutations) in any one of
a number of genes that carry the instructions to make theperipheral nerves. Genes contain the instructions for howthe body grows and develops before and after a person isborn. There are probably at least 15 different genes thatcan cause CMT. However, as of early 2001, many havenot yet been identified.
CMT types 1 and 2 can be broken down into sub-
types based upon the gene that is causing CMT. The sub-types are labeled by letters, so there is CMT1A, CMT1B,etc. Therefore, the gene with a mutation that causesCMT1A is different from that that causes CMT1B.
Types of CMT
CMT1A. The most common type of CMT is called"
"Types of CMT
CMT1A. The most common type of CMT is called
CMT1A. It is caused by a mutation in a gene calledperipheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) located on chro-mosome 17. The job of this gene is to make a protein(PMP22) that makes up part of the myelin. In most peoplewho have CMT, the mutation that causes the condition isa duplication (doubling) of the PMP22 gene. Instead ofhaving two copies of the PMP22 gene (one on each chro-mosome) there are three copies. It is not known how thisextra copy of the PMP22 gene causes the observed symp-toms. A small percentage of people with CMT1A do nothave a duplication of the PMP22 gene, but rather have apoint mutation in the gene. A point mutation is like a typoin the gene that causes it to work incorrectly.

"HEREDITARY NEUROPATHY WITH LIABILITY TO PRES-
SURE PALSIES (HNPP). HNPP is a condition that is also
caused by a mutation in the PMP22 gene. The mutationis a deletion. Therefore, there is only one copy of thePMP22 gene instead of two. People who have HNPPmay have some of the signs of CMT. However, they alsohave episodes where they develop weakness and prob-lems with sensation after compression of certain pressurepoints such as the elbows or knee. Often these symptomswill resolve after a few days or weeks, but sometimesthey are permanent.
CMT1B. Another type of CMT, called CMT1B, is
caused by a mutation in a gene called myelin protein zero(MPZ) located on chromosome 1. The job of this gene isto make the layers of myelin stick together as they arewrapped around the axon. The mutations in this gene arepoint mutations because they involve a change (eitherdeletion, substitution, or insertion) at one specific com-ponent of a gene."
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 733Charcot Marie Tooth diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 733
"CMTX. Another type of CMT, called CMTX, is usu-
ally considered a subtype of CMT1 because it affects themyelin, but it has a different type of inheritance than type1 or type 2. In CMTX, the CMT-causing gene is locatedon the X chromosome and is called connexin 32 (Cx32).The job of this gene is to code for a class of protein calledconnexins that form tunnels between the layers of myelin.
CMT2. There are at least five different genes that can
cause CMT type 2. Therefore, CMT2 has subtypes A, B,C, D and E. As of early 2001, scientists have narrowed inon the location of most of the CMT2 causing genes.However, the specific genes and the mutations have notyet been found for most types. Very recently, the gene forCMT2E has been found. The gene is called neurofila-ment-light (NF-L). Because it has just been discovered,not much is known about how mutations in this genecause CMT.
CMT3. In the past a condition called Dejerine-Sottas"
"CMT3. In the past a condition called Dejerine-Sottas
disease was referred to as CMT3. This is a severe type ofCMT in which symptoms begin in infancy or early child-hood. It is now known that this is not a separate type ofCMT and in fact people who have onset in infancy orearly childhood often have mutations in the PMP22 orMPZ genes.
CMT4. CMT4 is a rare type of CMT in which the
nerve conduction tests have slow response results. Howev-er, it is classified differently from CMT1 because it ispassed through families by a different pattern of inheri-tance. There are five different subtypes and each has onlybeen described in a few families. The symptoms in CMT4are often severe and other symptoms such as deafness maybe present. There are three different genes that have beenassociated with CMT4 as of early 2001. They are calledMTMR2, EGR2, and NDRG1. More research is requiredto understand how mutations in these genes cause CMT.
Inheritance
CMT1A and 1B, HNPP, and all of the subtypes of"
"Inheritance
CMT1A and 1B, HNPP, and all of the subtypes of
CMT2 have autosomal dominant inheritance. Autosomalrefers to the first 22 pairs of chromosomes that are thesame in males and females. Therefore, males andfemales are affected equally in these types. In a dominantcondition, only one gene of a pair needs to have a muta-tion in order for a person to have symptoms of the condi-tion. Therefore, anyone who has these types has a 50%,or one in two, chance of passing CMT on to each of theirchildren. This chance is the same for each pregnancy
and does not change based on previous children.
CMTX has X-linked inheritance. Since males only
have one X chromosome, they only have one copy of theCx32 gene. Thus, when a male has a mutation in his Cx32gene, he will have CMT. However, females have two X"
"chromosomes and therefore have two copies of the Cx32gene. If they have a mutation in one copy of their Cx32genes, they will only have mild to moderate symptoms ofCMT that may go unnoticed. This is because their normalcopy of the Cx32 gene does make normal myelin.
Females pass on one or the other of their X chromo-
somes to their children—sons or daughters. If a womanwith a Cx32 mutation passes her normal X chromosome,she will have an unaffected son or daughter who will notpass CMT on to his or her children. If the woman passesthe chromosome with Cx32 mutation on she will have anaffected son or daughter, although the daughter will bemildly affected or have no symptoms. Therefore, a womanwith a Cx32 mutation has a 50%, or a one in two, chanceof passing the mutation to her children: a son will beaffected, and a daughter may only have mild symptoms.
When males pass on an X chromosome, they have a"
"When males pass on an X chromosome, they have a
daughter. When they pass on a Y chromosome, they havea son. Since the Cx32 mutation is on the X chromosome,a man with CMTX will always pass the Cx32 mutationon to his daughters. However, when he has a son, hepasses on the Y chromosome, and therefore the son willnot be affected. Therefore, an affected male passes theCx32 gene mutation on to all of his daughters, but tonone of his sons.
CMT4 has autosomal recessive inheritance. Males
and females are equally affected. In order for a person tohave CMT4, they must have a mutation in both of theirCMT-causing genes—one inherited from each parent.The parents of an affected person are called carriers.They have one normal copy of the gene and one copywith a mutation. Carriers do not have symptoms of CMT.Two carrier parents have a 25%, or one in four, chance ofpassing CMT on to each of their children.
The onset of symptoms is highly variable, even"
"The onset of symptoms is highly variable, even
among members of the same family. Symptoms usuallyprogress very slowly over a person’s lifetime. The mainproblems caused by CMT are weakness and loss of sen-sation mainly in the feet and hands. The first symptomsare usually problems with the feet such as high archesand problems with walking and running. Tripping whilewalking and sprained ankles are common. Muscle loss inthe feet and calves leads to “foot drop” where the footdoes not lift high enough off the ground when walking.Complaints of cold legs are common, as are cramps inthe legs, especially after exercise .
In many people, the fingers and hands eventually
become affected. Muscle loss in the hands can make finemovements such as working buttons and zippers difficult.Some patients develop tremor in the upper limbs. Loss ofsensation can cause problems such as numbness and the"
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 734Charcot Marie Tooth diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 734
"inability to feel if something is hot or cold. Most people
with CMT remain able to walk throughout their lives.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of CMT begins with a careful neurological
exam to determine the extent and distribution of weakness. Athorough family history should be taken at this time to deter-mine if other people in the family are affected. Testing mayalso be performed to rule out other causes of neuropathy.
A nerve conduction velocity test should be per-
formed to measure how fast impulses travel through thenerves. This test may show characteristic features ofCMT, but it is not diagnostic of CMT. Nerve conductiontesting may be combined with electromyography
(EMG), an electrical test of the muscles.
A nerve biopsy (removal of a small piece of the
nerve) may be performed to look for changes characteris-tic of CMT. However, this testing is not diagnostic ofCMT and is usually not necessary for making a diagnosis.
Definitive diagnosis of CMT is made only by genet-"
"Definitive diagnosis of CMT is made only by genet-
ic testing , usually performed by drawing a small amount
of blood. As of early 2001, testing is available to detectmutations in PMP22, MPZ, Cx32 and EGR2. However,research is progressing rapidly and new testing is oftenmade available every few months. All affected membersof a family have the same type of CMT. Therefore once amutation is found in one affected member, it is possibleto test other members who may have symptoms or are atrisk of developing CMT.
Prenatal diagnosis
Testing during pregnancy to determine whether an
unborn child is affected is possible if genetic testing in afamily has identified a specific CMT-causing mutation.This can be done after 10–12 weeks of pregnancy using aprocedure called chorionic villus sampling (CVS). CVS
involves removing a tiny piece of the placenta and exam-ining the cells. Testing can also be done by amniocente-
sisafter 16 weeks gestation by removing a small amount"
"sisafter 16 weeks gestation by removing a small amount
of the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby and analyzingthe cells in the fluid. Each of these procedures has a smallrisk of miscarriage associated with it, and those who are
interested in learning more should check with their doctoror genetic counselor. Couples interested in these optionsshould obtain genetic counseling to carefully explore all
of the benefits and limitations of these procedures.
Treatment
There is no cure for CMT. However, physical and
occupational therapy are an important part of CMT treat-ment. Physical therapy is used to preserve range of motionand minimize deformity caused by muscle shortening, orcontracture. Braces are sometimes used to improve control"
"of the lower extremities that can help tremendously withbalance. After wearing braces, people often find that theyhave more energy because they are using less energy tofocus on their walking. Occupational therapy is used toprovide devices and techniques that can assist tasks suchas dressing, feeding, writing, and other routine activities ofdaily life. V oice-activated software can also help peoplewho have problems with fine motor control.
It is very important that people with CMT avoid
injury that causes them to be immobile for long periodsof time. It is often difficult for people with CMT to returnto their original strength after injury.
There is a long list of medications that should be
avoided if possible by people diagnosed with CMT such ashydralazine (Apresoline), megadoses of vitamin A, B
6, and"
"6, and
D, Taxol, and large intravenous doses of penicillin. Com-plete lists are available from the CMT support groups. Peo-ple considering taking any of these medications shouldweigh the risks and benefits with their physician.
Prognosis
The symptoms of CMT usually progress slowly over
many years, but do not usually shorten life expectancy.The majority of people with CMT do not need to use awheelchair during their lifetime. Most people with CMTare able to lead full and productive lives despite theirphysical challenges.

ease, is the result of two conditions present in the joint.The first factor is the inability to feel pain in the joint dueto nerve damage. The second factor is that injuries to thejoint go unnoticed leading to instability and making thejoint more susceptible to further injury. Repeated smallinjuries, strains and even fractures can go unnoticed until
finally the joint is permanently destroyed. Loss of the pro-tective sensation of pain is what leads to the disintegrationof the joint and often leads to deformity in the joint.Although this condition can affect any joint, the
knee is the joint most commonly involved. In individualswith diabetes mellitus , the foot is most commonly
affected. The disease can involve only one joint or it mayaffect two or three joints. More than three affected jointsis very rare. In all cases, the specific joint(s) affecteddepends on the location of the nerve damage.
Causes and symptoms"
"Causes and symptoms
Many diseases and injuries can interfere with the abil-
ity to feel pain. Conditions such as diabetes mellitus,spinal injuries and diseases, alcoholism , and even syphilis
can all lead to a loss of the ability to feel pain in someareas. Lack of pain sensation may also be congenital.
The symptoms of Charcot’s joints can go unnoticed
for some time and may be confused with osteoarthritis
in the beginning. Swelling and stiffness in a joint withoutthe expected pain, or with less pain than would beexpected, are the primary symptoms of this condition. Asthe condition progresses, however, the joint can becomevery painful due to fluid build-up and bony growths.

"Diagnosis
Charcot’s joints is suspected when a person with a
disease that impairs pain sensation exhibits painlessswelling and/or stiffness in a joint. Standard x rays willshow damage to the joint, and may also show abnormalbone growth and calcium deposits. Floating bone frag-ments from previous injuries may also be visible.
Treatment
In the early stages of Charcot’s joints, braces to sta-
bilize the joints can help stop or minimize the damage.When the disease has progressed beyond braces, surgerycan sometimes repair the joint. If the damage is exten-sive, an artificial joint may be necessary.
Prognosis
Treatment of the disease causing loss of pain percep-
tion may help to slow the damage to the joints.
Prevention
Preventing or effectively managing the underlying
disease can slow or in some cases reverse joint damage,but the condition cannot be prevented.

Chelation therapy
Definition
Chelation therapy is an intravenous treatment
designed to bind heavy metals in the body in order totreat heavy metal toxicity. Proponents claim it also treatscoronary artery disease and other illnesses that may be
linked to damage from free radicals (reactive molecules).
Purpose
The benefits of EDTA chelation for the treatment of
lead poisoning and excessively high calcium levels are
undisputed. The claims of benefits for those sufferingfrom atherosclerosis , coronary artery disease, and other
degenerative diseases are more difficult to prove. Report-ed uses for chelation therapy include treatment of angi-
na,gangrene , arthritis, multiple sclerosis ,Parkinson’s
disease ,psoriasis , and Alzheimer’s disease . Improve-
ment is also claimed for people experiencing diminishedsight, hearing, smell, coordination, and sexual potency.
Description
Origins
The term chelation is from the Greek root word"
"Description
Origins
The term chelation is from the Greek root word
“chele,” meaning “claw.” Chelating agents, most com-monly diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), were originallydesigned for industrial applications in the early 1900s. Itwas not until the World War II era that the potential formedical therapy was realized. The initial intent was todevelop antidotes to poison gas and radioactive contami-nants. The need for widespread therapy of this nature didnot materialize, but more practical uses were found forchelation. During the following decade, EDTA chelationtherapy became standard treatment for people sufferingfrom lead poisoning . Patients who had received this
treatment claimed to have other health improvementsthat could not be attributed to the lead removal only.Especially notable were comments from those who hadpreviously suffered from intermittent claudication andangina. They reported suffering less pain and fatigue ,"
"with improved endurance, after chelation therapy. Thesereports stimulated further interest in the potential bene-fits of chelation therapy for people suffering from athero-sclerosis and coronary artery disease.
If the preparatory examination suggests that there is a
condition that could be improved by chelation therapy, andthere is no health reason why it shouldn’t be used, then thetreatment can begin. The patient is generally taken to acomfortable treatment area, sometimes in a group loca-tion, and an intravenous line is started. A solution ofEDTA together with vitamins and minerals tailored for"
"the individual patient is given. Most treatments take threeto four hours, as the infusion must be given slowly in orderto be safe. The number of recommended treatments is usu-ally between 20 and 40. They are given one to three timesa week. Maintenance treatments can then be given at therate of once or twice a month. Maximum benefits arereportedly attained after approximately three months aftera treatment series. The cost of therapy is considerable, butit is a fraction of the cost of an expensive medical proce-dure like cardiac bypass surgery. Intravenous vitamin Cand mercury chelation therapies are also offered.
Preparations
A candidate for chelation therapy should initially
have a thorough history and physical to define the type andextent of clinical problems. Laboratory tests will be doneto determine whether there are any conditions present thatwould prevent the use of chelation. Patients who have pre-existing hypocalcemia , poor liver or kidney function, con-"
"gestive heart failure ,hypoglycemia ,tuberculosis , clot-
ting problems, or potentially allergic conditions are athigher risk for complications from chelation therapy. ADoppler ultrasound may be performed to determine theadequacy of blood flow in different regions of the body.
Precautions
It is important for people who receive chelation ther-
apy to work with medical personnel who are experiencedin the use of this treatment. Treatment should not beundertaken before a good physical, lifestyle evaluation,history, and any laboratory tests necessary are per-formed. The staff must be forthcoming about test resultsand should answer any questions the patient may have.Evaluation and treatment should be individualized andinvolve assessment of kidney function before each treat-ment with chelation, since the metals bound by theEDTA are excreted through the kidneys.
Although EDTA binds harmful, toxic metals like"
"Although EDTA binds harmful, toxic metals like
mercury, lead, and cadmium, it also binds some essentialnutrients of the body, such as copper, iron, calcium, zinc,and magnesium. Large amounts of zinc are lost duringchelation. Zinc deficiency can cause impaired immunefunction and other harmful effects. Supplements of zincare generally given to patients undergoing chelation, butit is not known whether this is adequate to prevent defi-ciency. Also, chelation therapy does not replace propernutrition ,exercise , and appropriate medications or
surgery for specific diseases or conditions.

"Side effects
Side effects of chelation therapy are reportedly
unusual, but are occasionally serious. Mild reactions mayinclude, but are not limited to, local irritation at the infu-sion site, skin reactions, nausea, headache ,dizziness ,
hypoglycemia, fever , leg cramps, or loose bowel move-
ments. Some of the more serious complications reportedhave included hypocalcemia, kidney damage, decreasedclotting ability, anemia, bone marrow damage, insulinshock, thrombophlebitis with embolism , and even rare
deaths. However, some doctors feel that the latter groupsof complications occurred before the safer method cur-rently used for chelation therapy was developed.
Research and general acceptance
EDTA chelation is a highly controversial therapy."
"Research and general acceptance
EDTA chelation is a highly controversial therapy.
The treatment is approved by the United States Food andDrug Administration (FDA) for lead poisoning and seri-ously high calcium levels. However, for the treatment ofatherosclerotic heart disease, EDTA chelation therapy isnot endorsed by the American Heart Association (AHA),the FDA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), or theAmerican College of Cardiology. The AHA reports thatthere are no adequate, controlled, published scientificstudies using currently approved scientific methods tosupport this therapy for the treatment of coronary arterydisease. However, a pooled analysis from the results ofover 70 studies showed positive results in all but one.

Chemonucleolysis
Definition
Chemonucleolysis is a medical procedure that
involves the dissolving of the gelatinous cushioningmaterial in an intervertebral disk by the injection of anenzyme such as chymopapain.
Purpose
Between each vertebra lies a disk of cushioning
material that keeps the spinal bones from rubbing togeth-er and absorbs some of the shock to the spine from body
movements. In the center of the disk is soft, gelatinousmaterial called the nucleus pulposus (NP). The NP is sur-rounded by a tough fibrous coating. Sometimes when theback is injured, this coating can weaken and bulge or tearto allow the NP to ooze out. When this happens, it iscalled a herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP), or—in com-mon language—a herniated disk .
When the disk bulges or herniates, it can put pres-"
"When the disk bulges or herniates, it can put pres-
sure on nerves which originate in the spinal column, andgo to other parts of the body. This causes lower backpain , and/or pain to the hips, legs, arms, shoulders, and
neck, depending on the location of the herniated disk.Chemonucleolysis uses chymopapain, an enzyme de-rived from papyrus, to dissolve the disk material that has
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 738ChemonucleolysisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 738"
"been displaced because of injury. Herniated disks are the
cause of only a small proportion of cases of lower backpain, and chemonucleolysis is appropriate for only somecases of HNP.
Chemonucleolysis is a conservative alternative to
disk surgery. There are three types of disk injuries. Aprotruded disk is one that is intact but bulging. In anextruded disk, the fibrous wrapper has torn and the NPhas oozed out, but is still connected to the disk. In asequestered disk, a fragment of the NP has broken loosefrom the disk and is free in the spinal canal. Chemonu-cleolysis is effective on protruded and extruded disks,but not on sequestered disk injuries. In the UnitedStates, chymopapain chemonucleolysis is approvedonly for use in the lumbar (lower) spine. In other coun-tries, it has also been used successfully to treat cervical(upper spine) hernias.
Other indications that a patient is a good candidate
for chemonucleolysis instead of surgery include:"
"for chemonucleolysis instead of surgery include:
• the patient is 18–50 years of age• leg pain is worse than lower back pain• other conservative treatments have failed• the spot where the herniated disk presses on the nerve
has been pinpointed by myelography , computed
tomography scan (CT scan), or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI)
• the patient wishes to avoid surgery
Precautions
There are some situations in which chemonucleoly-
sis should not be performed. Chymopapain is derivedfrom the papaya. About 0.3% of patients are allergic tochymopapain and go into life-threatening shock whenexposed to the enzyme. Chemonucleolysis should not beperformed on patients allergic to chymopapain orpapaya. It also should not be done:
• when the patient is pregnantKEY TERMS

• if the patient has had several failed back operations
• if a spinal cord tumor is present
• if the patient has a neurological disease such as multi-
ple sclerosis
Other conditions may affect the appropriateness of
chemonucleolysis, including hypertension ,obesity , dia-
betes, and a family history of stroke.
Description
A small gauge needle is placed in the center of the
affected disk. Chymopapain is introduced into the disk.The patient needs to remain still.
Preparation
Patients will need tests such as a myelogram or CT
scan to pinpoint the herniated disk. Some doctors medicatethe patient 24 hours prior to the operation in order todecrease the chances of post-operative lower back stiffness.
Aftercare

"Aftercare
Patients may feel lower back stiffness, which goes
away in few weeks. Heavy lifting and sports activitiesshould be avoided for at least three months.
Risks
The greatest risk is that the patient may be allergic to
chymopapain. The death rate for chemonucleolysis is
only 0.02%. Complications overall are five to 10 timesless than with conventional surgery, and the failure rate isroughly comparable to the failure rate in conventionaldisk surgery.
Normal results
Many patients feel immediate relief from pain, but,
in about 30% of patients, maximal relief takes six weeks.The long term (seven to 20 years) success rate averagesabout 75%, which is comparable to the success rate forconventional surgery.

"Chemotherapy
Definition
Chemotherapy is treatment of cancer with anti-
cancer drugs .
Purpose
The main purpose of chemotherapy is to kill cancer
cells. It is usually used to treat patients with cancer thathas spread from the place in the body where it started(metastasized). Chemotherapy destroys cancer cells any-where in the body. It even kills cells that have broken offfrom the main tumor and traveled through the blood orlymph systems to other parts of the body.
Chemotherapy can cure some types of cancer. In
some cases, it is used to slow the growth of cancer cellsor to keep the cancer from spreading to other parts of thebody. When a cancer has been removed by surgery,chemotherapy may be used to keep the cancer from com-ing back (adjuvant therapy). Chemotherapy also can easethe symptoms of cancer, helping some patients to have abetter quality of life.
Precautions
There are many different types of chemotherapy"
"Precautions
There are many different types of chemotherapy
drugs. Oncologists, doctors who specialize in treatingcancer, determine which drugs are best suited foreach patient. This decision is based on the type ofcancer, the patient’s age and health, and other drugsthe patient is taking. Some patients should not betreated with certain chemotherapy drugs. Age andother conditions may affect the drugs with which aperson may be treated. Heart disease, kidney disease,and diabetes are conditions that may limit the choiceof treatment drugs.

"Description
More than 50 chemotherapy drugs are currently
available to treat cancer and many more are being testedfor their ability to destroy cancer cells. Most chemothera-py drugs interfere with the ability of cells to grow or mul-tiply. Although these drugs affect all cells in the body,many useful treatments are most effective against rapidlygrowing cells. Cancer cells grow more quickly than mostother body cells. Other cells that grow fast are cells of thebone marrow that produce blood cells, cells in the stom-ach and intestines, and cells of the hair follicles. There-fore, the most common side effects of chemotherapy arelinked to their effects on other fast growing cells.Types of chemotherapy drugs
Chemotherapy drugs are classified based on how
they work. The main types of chemotherapy drugs aredescribed below:
• Alkylating drugs kill cancer cells by directly attacking
DNA, the genetic material of the genes. Cyclophos-phamide is an alkylating drug."
"DNA, the genetic material of the genes. Cyclophos-phamide is an alkylating drug.
• Antimetabolites interfere with the production of DNA
and keep cells from growing and multiplying. Anexample of an antimetabolite is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
• Antitumor antibiotics are made from natural sub-
stances such as fungi in the soil. They interfere withimportant cell functions, including production of DNAand cell proteins. Doxorubicin and bleomycin belong tothis group of chemotherapy drugs.
• Plant alkaloids prevent cells from dividing normally.
Vinblastine and vincristine are plant alkaloids obtainedfrom the periwinkle plant.
• Steroid hormones slow the growth of some cancers that
depend on hormones. For example, tamoxifen is usedto treat breast cancers that depend on the hormoneestrogen for growth.
Combination chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is usually given in addition to other
cancer treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy ."
"cancer treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy .
When given with other treatments, it is called adjuvantchemotherapy. An oncologist decides which chemothera-py drug or combination of drugs will work best for eachpatient. The use of two or more drugs together often worksbetter than a single drug for treating cancer. This is calledcombination chemotherapy. Scientific studies of differentdrug combinations help doctors learn which combinationswork best for each type of cancer.
How chemotherapy is given
Chemotherapy is administered in different ways,
depending on the drugs to be given and the type of can-cer. Doctors decide the dose of chemotherapy drugs con-sidering many factors, among them being the patient’sheight and weight.
Chemotherapy may be given by one or more of the
following methods:
• orally• by injection• through a catheter or port
• topically
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 740ChemotherapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 740"
"Oral chemotherapy is given by mouth in the form a
pill, capsule, or liquid. This is the easiest method and canusually be done at home.
Intravenous (IV) chemotherapy is injected into a
vein. A small needle is inserted into a vein on the hand orlower arm. The needle is usually attached to a small tubecalled a catheter, which delivers the drug to the needlefrom an IV bag or bottle.
Intramuscular (IM) chemotherapy is injected into a
muscle. Chemotherapy given by intramuscular injectionis absorbed into the blood more slowly than IVchemotherapy. Because of this, the effects of IMchemotherapy may last longer than chemotherapy givenintravenously. Chemotherapy may also be injected sub-cutaneously (SQ or SC), which means under the skin.Injection of chemotherapy directly into the cancer iscalled intralesional (IL) injection.
Chemotherapy may also be given by a catheter or"
"Chemotherapy may also be given by a catheter or
port permanently inserted into a central vein or body cav-ity. A port is a small reservoir or container that is placedin a vein or under the skin in the area where the drug willbe given. These methods eliminate the need for repeatedinjections and may allow patients to spend less time inthe hospital while receiving chemotherapy. A commonlocation for a permanent catheter is the external jugularvein in the neck. Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy isadministered into the abdominal cavity through acatheter or port. Chemotherapy given by catheter or portinto the spinal fluid is called intrathecal (IT) administra-tion. Catheters and ports may also be placed in the chestcavity, bladder, or pelvis, depending on the location ofthe cancer to be treated.
Topical chemotherapy is given as a cream or oint-
ment applied directly to the cancer. This method is morecommon in treatment of certain types of skin cancer.
Treatment location and schedule"
"Treatment location and schedule
Patients may take chemotherapy at home, in the doc-
tor’s office, or as an inpatient or outpatient at the hospi-tal. Most patients stay in the hospital when first begin-ning chemotherapy, so their doctor can check for anyside effects and change the dose if needed.
How often and how long chemotherapy is given
depends on the type of cancer, how patients respond tothe drugs, patients’ health and ability to tolerate thedrugs, and the types of drugs given. Chemotherapyadministration may take only a few minutes or may lastas long as several hours. Chemotherapy may be givendaily, weekly, or monthly. A rest period may follow acourse of treatment before the next course begins. Incombination chemotherapy, more than one drug may begiven at a time, or they may be given alternately, one fol-
lowing the other.

Preparation
A number of medical tests are done before
chemotherapy is started. The oncologist will determinehow much the cancer has spread from the results of xrays and other imaging tests and from samples of thetumor taken during surgery.
Blood tests give the doctor important information
about the function of the blood cells and levels of chemi-cals in the blood. A complete blood count (CBC) is
commonly done before and regularly during treatment.The CBC shows the numbers of white blood cells, redblood cells, and platelets in the blood. Becausechemotherapy affects the bone marrow, where bloodcells are made, levels of these cells often drop duringchemotherapy. The white blood cells and platelets aremost likely to be affected by chemotherapy. A drop in the

"white blood cell count means that the immune system
cannot function properly. Low levels of platelets cancause a patient to bleed easily from a cut or other wound.A low red blood cell count can lead to anemia (deficien-cy of red blood cells) and fatigue .
When a chemotherapy treatment takes a long time, the
patient may prepare for it by wearing comfortable clothes.Bringing a book to read or a tape to listen to may help passthe time and ease the stress of receiving chemotherapy.
Some patients bring a friend or family member to providecompany and support during treatment.
Sometimes, patients taking chemotherapy drugs
known to cause nausea are given medications called anti-emetics before chemotherapy is administered. Anti-emet-ic drugs help to lessen feelings of nausea. Two anti-nau-sea medications that may be used are Kytril and Zofran.
Other ways to prepare for chemotherapy and help
lessen nausea are:"
"Other ways to prepare for chemotherapy and help
lessen nausea are:
• regularly eat nutritious foods and drink lots of fluids• eat and drink normally until about two hours before

therapy include:
• follow any instructions given by the doctor or nurse• take all prescribed medications• eat small amounts of bland foods• drink lots of fluids• get plenty of rest

"mild exercise , such as taking a walk.
Risks
Chemotherapy drugs are toxic to normal cells as
well as cancer cells. A dose that will destroy cancer cellswill probably cause damage to some normal cells. Doc-tors adjust doses to do the least amount of harm possibleto normal cells. Some patients feel few or no side effects,and others may have more serious side effects. In somecases, a dose adjustment is all that is needed to reduce orstop a side effect.
Some chemotherapy drugs have more side effects
than others. Some of the most common side effects are:
•nausea and vomiting• loss of appetite
• hair loss• anemia and fatigue
• infection
• easy bleeding or bruising• sores in the mouth and throat• neuropathy and other damage to the nervous system• kidney damage
Nausea and vomiting are common, but can usually
be controlled by taking antinausea drugs , drinking
enough fluids, and avoiding spicy foods. Loss of appetitemay be due to nausea or the stress of undergoing cancertreatment."
"Some chemotherapy drugs cause hair loss, but it is
almost always temporary.
Low blood cell counts caused by the effect of
chemotherapy on the bone marrow can lead to anemia,infections, and easy bleeding and bruising. Patients withanemia have too few red blood cells to deliver oxygenand nutrients to the body’s tissues. Anemic patients feeltired and weak. If red blood cell levels fall too low, ablood transfusion may be given.
Patients receiving chemotherapy are more likely to
get infections. This happens because their infection-fighting white blood cells are reduced. It is important totake measures to avoid getting infections. When thewhite blood cell count drops too low, the doctor may pre-scribe medications called colony stimulating factors thathelp white blood cells grow. Neupogen and Leukine aretwo colony stimulants used as treatments to help fightinfection.
Platelets are blood cells that make the blood clot."
"Platelets are blood cells that make the blood clot.
When patients do not have enough platelets, they maybleed or bruise easily, even from small injuries. Patientswith low blood platelets should take precautions to avoidinjuries. Medicines such as aspirin and other pain reliev-
ers can affect platelets and slow down the clotting process.
Chemotherapy can cause irritation and dryness in the
mouth and throat. Painful sores may form that can bleedand become infected. Precautions to avoid this side effectinclude getting dental care before chemotherapy begins,brushing the teeth and gums regularly with a soft brush,and avoiding mouth washes that contain salt or alcohol.
Normal results
The main goal of chemotherapy is to cure cancer.
Many cancers are cured by chemotherapy. It may be usedin combination with surgery to keep a cancer from spread-

"ing to other parts of the body. Some widespread, fast-
growing cancers are more difficult to treat. In these cases,chemotherapy may slow the growth of the cancer cells.
Doctors can tell if the chemotherapy is working by
the results of medical tests. Physical examination , blood
tests, and x rays are all used to check the effects of treat-ment on the cancer.
The possible outcomes of chemotherapy are:
• Complete remission or response. The cancer complete-
ly disappears. The course of chemotherapy is complet-ed and the patient is tested regularly for a recurrence.
• Partial remission or response. The cancer shrinks in
size but does not disappear. The same chemotherapymay be continued or a different combination of drugsmay be tried.
• Stabilization. The cancer does not grow or shrink.
Other therapy options may be explored. A tumor maystay stabilized for many years.
• Progression. The cancer continues to grow. Other thera-
py options may be explored."
"• Progression. The cancer continues to grow. Other thera-
py options may be explored.
• A secondary malignancy may develop from the one

"Purpose
Chest drainage therapy is done to relieve pressure on
the lungs, and remove fluid that could promote infection.Installing a chest drainage tube can be either an emer-gency or a planned procedure.
Removing air or fluids from the chest involves the
insertion of a tube through the skin and the musclesbetween the ribs, and into the chest cavity. This cavity isalso called the pleural space. Insertion of this tube iscalled thoracostomy, and chest drainage therapy is some-times called thoracostomy tube drainage.
Conditions that may need to be treated by chest
drainage therapy include emphysema (air in the tissues
of the lungs), tuberculosis , and spontaneous pneu-
mothorax (air in the chest cavity) that causes more
than a 25% collapse of the lung. Other conditionsinclude cancer that causes excessive secretions,
empyema (pus in the thoracic cavity), or hemothorax"
"empyema (pus in the thoracic cavity), or hemothorax

Oftentimes an x ray is performed prior to treatment
to determine whether the problem is either fluid or air in

"the pleural space. Sometimes a procedure called thora-
centesis is performed in an effort to avoid inserting a
chest drainage tube. In this procedure a needle with acatheter is inserted into the pleural space and fluid isremoved. When fluid continues to accumulate, chestdrainage therapy is usually the next step. This is especial-ly true when there is a lung infection underlying the fluidbuild-up.
Precautions
Chest drainage therapy is not done if a collapsed
lung is not life-threatening. It also should be avoided forpatients who have blood clotting problems.
Description
Most patients are awake when the chest drainage
tube is inserted. They are given a sedative and a localanesthetic. Chest drainage tubes are usually insertedbetween the ribs. The exact location depends on the typeof material to be drained and its location in the lungs.

"An incision is made in the skin and through the mus-
cles between the ribs. A chest tube is inserted andsecured in place. The doctor connects one end of the tubeto the chest drainage system.
The chest drainage system must remain sealed to
prevent air from entering the chest cavity through thetube. One commonly used system is a water-sealdrainage system, comprised of three compartments thatcollect and drain the fluid or air without allowing air tobackflow into the tube. An alternative to this system is toconnect the tube to a negative suction pump.
Once the tube and drainage system are in place, a
chest x ray is done to confirm that the tube is in the rightlocation, and that it is working. In some cases it may beKEY TERMS

"Aftercare
Normally after the material has been removed

"Risks
Problems can arise in the insertion of the tube if the
membrane lining the chest cavity is thick or if it hasmany adhesions. The tube will not drain correctly if thechest cavity contains blood clots or thick secretions thatare often associated with infections. Excessive bleedingmay occur during the insertion and positioning of thetube. Infection may result from the procedure. Pain is
also a common complication.
Normal results
The gas, pus, or blood is drained from the chest cavity,
and the lungs reinflate or begin to function more efficiently.The site at which the tube was inserted heals normally.

Chest physical therapy
Definition
Chest physical therapy is the term for a group of treat-
ments designed to improve respiratory efficiency, promoteexpansion of the lungs, strengthen respiratory muscles,and eliminate secretions from the respiratory system.
Purpose
The purpose of chest physical therapy, also called
chest physiotherapy, is to help patients breathe morefreely and to get more oxygen into the body. Chest physi-cal therapy includes postural drainage, chest percussion,chest vibration, turning, deep breathing exercises, andcoughing. It is usually done in conjunction with othertreatments to rid the airways of secretions. These othertreatments include suctioning, nebulizer treatments, andthe administration of expectorant drugs.
Chest physical therapy can be used with newborns,"
"Chest physical therapy can be used with newborns,
infants, children, and adults. People who benefit fromchest physical therapy exhibit a wide range of problemsthat make it difficult to clear secretions from their lungs.Some people who may receive chest physical therapyinclude people with cystic fibrosis or neuromuscular dis-
eases like Guillain-Barré syndrome , progressive mus-
cle weakness ( myasthenia gravis ), or tetanus . People
with lung diseases such as bronchitis ,pneumonia ,o r
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) also ben-efit from chest physical therapy. People who are likely toaspirate their mucous secretions because of diseases suchas cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy also receive
chest physical therapy, as do some people who arebedridden, confined to a wheelchair, or who cannotbreathe deeply because of postoperative pain .
Precautions
Chest physical therapy should not be performed on
people with

"Precautions
Chest physical therapy should not be performed on
people with
• bleeding from the lungs
• neck or head injuries• fractured ribs• collapsed lungs
• damaged chest walls• tuberculosis• acute asthma
• recent heart attack
• pulmonary embolism• lung abscess
• active hemorrhage• some spine injuries• recent surgery, open wounds , or burns
Description
Chest physical therapy can be performed in a variety
of settings including critical care units, hospitals, nursinghomes, outpatient clinics, and at the patient’s home.Depending on the circumstances, chest physical therapymay be performed by anyone from a respiratory care ther-apist to a trained member of the patient’s family. Differentpatient conditions warrant different levels of training.

"Chest physical therapy consists of a variety of proce-
dures that are applied depending on the patient’s healthand condition. Hospitalized patients are reevaluated fre-quently to establish which procedures are most effectiveand best tolerated. Patients receiving long term chest phys-ical therapy are reevaluated about every three months.
Turning
Turning from side to side permits lung expansion.
Patients may turn themselves or be turned by a caregiver.The head of the bed is also elevated to promote drainageif the patient can tolerate this position. Critically illpatients and those dependent on mechanical respirationare turned once every one to two hours around the clock.
Coughing
Coughing helps break up secretions in the lungs so
that the mucus can be suctioned out or expectorated.Patients sit upright and inhale deeply through the nose.They then exhale in short puffs or coughs. Coughing isrepeated several times a day.
Deep breathing

"Deep breathing
Deep breathing helps expand the lungs and forces
better distribution of the air into all sections of the lung.The patient either sits in a chair or sits upright in bed andinhales, pushing the abdomen out to force maximumamounts of air into the lung. The abdomen is then con-tracted, and the patient exhales. Deep breathing exercisesare done several times each day for short periods.

"Postural drainage
Postural drainage uses the force of gravity to assist
in effectively draining secretions from the lungs and intothe central airway where they can either be coughed upor suctioned out. The patient is placed in a head or chestdown position and is kept in this position for up to 15minutes. Critical care patients and those depending onmechanical ventilation receive postural drainage therapyfour to six times daily. Percussion and vibration may beperformed in conjunction with postural drainage.
Percussion
Percussion is rhythmically striking the chest wall
with cupped hands. It is also called cupping, clapping, ortapotement. The purpose of percussion is to break upthick secretions in the lungs so that they can be more eas-ily removed. Percussion is performed on each lung seg-ment for one to two minutes at a time.

Chest x ray
Definition
A chest x ray is a procedure used to evaluate organs
and structures within the chest for symptoms of disease.Chest x rays include views of the lungs, heart, small por-tions of the gastrointestinal tract, thyroid gland and thebones of the chest area. X rays are a form of radiationthat can penetrate the body and produce an image on anx-ray film. Another name for x ray is radiograph.
Purpose
Chest x rays are ordered for a wide variety of diag-
nostic purposes. In fact, this is probably the most frequent-ly performed x ray. In some cases, chest x rays are orderedfor a single check of an organ’s condition, and at othertimes, serial x rays are ordered to compare to previousstudies. Some common reasons for chest x rays include:
Pulmonary disorders

rule out pneumonia . Other pulmonary disorders such as"
"rule out pneumonia . Other pulmonary disorders such as
emphysema or pneumothorax (presence of air or gas in
the chest cavity outside the lungs) may be detected orevaluated through the use of chest x ray.
Cancer
A chest x ray may be ordered by a physician to
check for possible tumors of the lungs, thyroid, lymphoidtissue, or bones of the thorax. These may be primarytumors. X rays also check for secondary spread of can-
cerfrom one organ to another.
Cardiac disorders
While less sensitive than echocardiography , chest x
ray can be used to check for disorders such as congestiveheart failure or pulmonary edema .

Diaphragm —The large muscle that is located
between the abdomen and the chest area. Thediaphragm aids in breathing.
Gastrointestinal —The digestive organs and struc-
tures, including the stomach and intestines.
Interstitial lung disease —About 180 diseases fall
into this category of breathing disorders. Injury orforeign substances in the lungs, (such as asbestosfibers) as well as infections, cancers, or inheriteddisorders may cause the diseases. They can lead tobreathing or heart failure."
"Lymphoid —Tissues relating to the lymphatic sys-

"shorter wavelengths than normal light. X rays canpenetrate most structures.Precautions
Pregnant women, particularly those in the first or
second trimester, should not have chest x rays unlessabsolutely necessary. If the exam is ordered, women whoare, or could possibly be, pregnant must wear a protec-tive lead apron. Because the procedure involves radia-tion, care should always be taken to avoid overexposure,particularly for children. However, the amount of radia-tion from one chest x ray procedure is minimal.
Description
Routine chest x rays consist of two views, the frontal
view (referred to as posterioranterior or PA), and the lat-eral (side) view. It is preferred that the patient stand forthis exam, particularly when studying collection of fluidin the lungs.

will ask the patient to hold his or her breath. It is veryimportant in taking a chest x ray to ensure there is nomotion that could detract from the quality and sharpnessof the film image. The procedure will only take a fewminutes and the time patients must hold their breaths is amatter of a few seconds.
The chest x ray may be performed in a physician’s
office or referred to an outpatient radiology facility orhospital radiology department. In some cases, particular-ly for bedridden patients, a portable chest x ray may betaken. Portable films are sometimes of poorer qualitythan those taken with permanent equipment, but are thebest choice for some patients or situations. Bedriddenpatients may be placed in as upright a position as possi-ble to get a clear picture, particularly of chest fluid.

"Preparation
There is no advance preparation necessary for chest
x rays. Once the patient arrives at the exam area, a hospi-tal gown will replace all clothing on the upper body andall jewelry must be removed.
Aftercare

rays.
Risks
The only risk associated with chest x ray is minimal
exposure to radiation, particularly for pregnant womenand children. Those patients should use protective leadaprons during the procedure. Technologists are cautionedto carefully check possible dislodging of any tubes or

Chickenpox
Definition
Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common and
extremely infectious childhood disease that also affectsadults on occasion. It produces an itchy, blistery rash thattypically lasts about a week and is sometimes accompa-nied by a fever or other symptoms. A single attack of"
"chickenpox almost always confers lifelong immunityagainst the disease. Because the symptoms of chicken-pox are easily recognized and in most cases merelyunpleasant rather than dangerous, treatment can almostalways be carried out at home. Severe complications candevelop, however, and professional medical attention isessential in some circumstances.
Description

"Description
Before the varicella vaccine (Varivax) was released
for use in 1995, virtually all of the four million childrenborn each year in the United States contracted chicken-pox, resulting in hospitalization in five of every 1,000cases and 100 deaths. Chickenpox is caused by the vari-cella-zoster virus (a member of the herpes virus family),which is spread through the air or by direct contact withan infected person. Once someone has been infected withthe virus, an incubation period of about 10–21 days pass-es before symptoms begin. The period during whichinfected people are able to spread the disease is believedto start one or two days before the rash breaks out and tocontinue until all the blisters have formed scabs, whichusually happens fout to seven days after the rash breaks

"out but may be longer in adolescents and adults. For this
reason, doctors recommend keeping children with chick-enpox away from school for about a week. It is not nec-essary, however, to wait until all the scabs have fallen off.

"Chickenpox has been a typical part of growing up for
most children in the industrialized world (although thismay change if the new varicella vaccine becomes morewidely accepted). The disease can strike at any age, butby ages nine or 10 about 80–90% of American childrenhave already been infected. U.S. children living in ruralareas and many foreign-born children are less likely to beimmune. Because almost every case of chickenpox, nomatter how mild, leads to lifelong protection against fur-ther attacks, adults account for less than 5% of all cases inthe United States. Study results reported by the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate thatmore than 90% of American adults are immune to thechickenpox virus. Adults, however, are much more likelythan children to suffer dangerous complications. Morethan half of all chickenpox deaths occur among adults.
Causes and symptoms
A case of chickenpox usually starts without warning"
"Causes and symptoms
A case of chickenpox usually starts without warning
or with only a mild fever and a slight feeling of unwellness.Within a few hours or days small red spots begin to appearon the scalp, neck, or upper half of the trunk. After a further12–24 hours the spots typically become itchy, fluid-filledbumps called vesicles, which continue to appear in cropsfor the next two to five days. In any area of skin, lesions ofa variety of stages can be seen. These blisters can spread tocover much of the skin, and in some cases may also befound inside the mouth, nose, ears, vagina, or rectum.Some people develop only a few blisters, but in most casesthe number reaches 250–500. The blisters soon begin toform scabs and fall off. Scarring usually does not occurunless the blisters have been scratched and become infect-ed. Occasionally a minor and temporary darkening of theskin (called hyperpigmentation ) is noticed around some"
"of the blisters. The degree of itchiness can range from bare-ly noticeable to extreme. Some chickenpox sufferers alsohave headaches, abdominal pain, or a fever. Full recovery
usually takes five to 10 days after the first symptomsappear. Again, the most severe cases of the disease tend tobe found among older children and adults.
Although for most people chickenpox is no more
than a matter of a few days’ discomfort, some groups areat risk for developing complications, the most commonof which are bacterial infections of the blisters, pneumo-
nia,dehydration ,encephalitis , and hepatitis:
• Infants. Complications occur much more often among
children less than one year old than among older chil-dren. The threat is greatest to newborns, who are moreat risk of death from chickenpox than any other group."
"Under certain circumstances, children born to motherswho contract chickenpox just prior to delivery face anincreased possibility of dangerous consequences,including brain damage and death. If the infectionoccurs during early pregnancy , there is a small (less
than 5%) risk of congenital abnormalities.
• Immunocompromised children. Children whose
immune systems have been weakened by a genetic dis-order, disease, or medical treatment usually experiencethe most severe symptoms of any group. They have thesecond-highest rate of death from chickenpox.
• Adults and children 15 and older. Among this group,
the typical symptoms of chickenpox tend to strike withgreater force, and the risk of complications is muchhigher than among young children.
Immediate medical help should always be sought
when anyone in these high-risk groups contracts the dis-ease.
Diagnosis

"Diagnosis
Where children are concerned, especially those with
recent exposure to the disease, diagnosis can usually bemade at home, by a school nurse, or by a doctor over thetelephone if the child’s parent or caregiver is unsure thatthe disease is chickenpox.
A doctor should be called immediately if:
• The child’s fever goes above 102°F (38.9°C) or takes
more than four days to disappear.
• The child’s blisters appear infected. Signs of infection
include leakage of pus from the blisters or excessiveredness, warmth, tenderness, or swelling around theblisters.
• The child seems nervous, confused, unresponsive, or
unusually sleepy; complains of a stiff neck or severeheadache ; shows signs of poor balance or has trouble
walking; finds bright lights hard to look at; is havingbreathing problems or is coughing a lot; is complainingof chest pain; is vomiting repeatedly; or is having con-vulsions. These may be signs of Reye’s syndrome or"
"encephalitis, two rare but potentially very dangerousconditions.
Treatment
With children, treatment usually takes place in the
home and focuses on reducing discomfort and fever.Because chickenpox is a viral disease, antibiotics are
ineffective against it.
Applying wet compresses or bathing the child in cool
or lukewarm water once a day can help the itch. Adding
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 750ChickenpoxGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 750"
"four to eight ounces of baking soda or one or two cups of
oatmeal to the bath is a good idea (oatmeal bath packetsare sold by pharmacies). Only mild soap should be usedin the bath. Patting, not rubbing, is recommended for dry-ing the child off, to prevent irritating the blisters.Calamine lotion (and some other kinds of lotions) alsohelp to reduce itchiness. Because scratching can causeblisters to become infected and lead to scarring, thechild’s nails should be cut short. Of course, older childrenneed to be warned not to scratch. For babies, light mittensor socks on the hands can help guard against scratching.
If mouth blisters make eating or drinking an
unpleasant experience, cold drinks and soft, bland foodscan ease the child’s discomfort. Painful genital blisterscan be treated with an anesthetic cream recommended bya doctor or pharmacist. Antibiotics are often prescribed ifblisters become infected.
Fever and discomfort can be reduced by aceta-"
"Fever and discomfort can be reduced by aceta-
minophen or another medication that does not contain
aspirin . Aspirin and any medications that contain
aspirin or other salicylates must not be used with chick-enpox, for they appear to increase the chances of devel-oping Reye’s syndrome. The best idea is to consult a doc-
tor or pharmacist if one is unsure about which medica-tions are safe.
Immunocompromised chickenpox sufferers are
sometimes given an antiviral drug called acyclovir (Zovi-rax). Studies have shown that Zovirax also lessens thesymptoms of otherwise healthy children and adults whocontract chickenpox, but the suggestion that it should beused to treat the disease among the general population,especially in children, is controversial.
Alternative treatment
Alternative practitioners seek to lessen the discom-
fort and fever caused by chickenpox. Like other practi-tioners, they suggest cool or lukewarm baths. Rolled oats(Avena sativa ) in the bath water help relieve itching ."
"(Place oats in a sock, run the bath, turn the sock torelease the milky anti-itch properties.) Other recom-mended remedies for itching include applying aloe vera,witch hazel, or herbal preparations of rosemary ( Rosmar-
inus officinalis ) and calendula ( Calendual officinalis ) to
the blisters. Homeopathic remedies are selected on a caseby case basis. Some common remedy choices are tartaremetic (antimonium tartaricum), windflower (pulsatilla),poison ivy ( Rhus toxicodendron ), and sulphur.
Prognosis
Most cases of chickenpox run their course within a
week without causing lasting harm. However, there isone long-term consequence of chickenpox that strikes"
"about 20% of the population, particularly people 50 andolder. Like all herpes viruses, the varicella-zoster virusnever leaves the body after an episode of chickenpox, butlies dormant in the nerve cells, where it may be reactivat-ed years later by disease or age-related weakening of theimmune system. The result is shingles (also called her-
pes zoster), a very painful nerve inflammation, accompa-nied by a rash, that usually affects the trunk or the facefor 10 days or more. Especially in the elderly, pain,called postherpetic neuralgia , may persist at the site of
the shingles for months or years. As of 1998, two newerdrugs for treatment of shingles are available. Both vala-cyclovir (Valtrex) and famciclovir (Famvir) stop thereplication of herpes zoster when administered within 72hours of appearance of the rash.

Beth KapesChild abuse
Definition
Child abuse is the blanket term for four types of
child mistreatment: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emo-tional abuse, and neglect. In many cases children are thevictims of more than one type of abuse. The abusers canbe parents or other family members, caretakers such asteachers and babysitters, acquaintances (including otherchildren), and (in rare instances) strangers.
Description
Prevalence of abuse
Child abuse was once viewed as a minor social prob-"
"lem affecting only a handful of United States children.However, in recent years it has received close attention fromthe media, law enforcement, and the helping professions,and with increased public and professional awareness hascome a sharp rise in the number of reported cases. Butbecause abuse is often hidden from view and its victims tooyoung or fearful to speak out, experts suggest that its trueprevalence is possibly much greater than the official dataindicate. In 1996, more than three million victims of allegedabuse were reported to child protective services (CPS) agen-cies in the United States, and the reports were substantiatedin more than one million cases. Put another way, 1.5% ofthe country’s children were confirmed victims of abuse in1996. Parents were the abusers in 77% of the confirmedcases, other relatives in 11%. Sexual abuse was more likelyto be committed by males, whereas females were responsi-ble for the majority of neglect cases. More than 1,000 Unit-ed States"
"whereas females were responsi-ble for the majority of neglect cases. More than 1,000 Unit-ed States children died from abuse in 1996."
"Although experts are quick to point out that abuse
occurs among all social, ethnic, and income groups,reported cases usually involve poor families with littleeducation. Young mothers, single-parent families, andparental alcohol or drug abuse are also common in report-ed cases. Charles F. Johnson remarks, “More than 90% ofabusing parents have neither psychotic nor criminal per-sonalities. Rather they tend to be lonely, unhappy, angry,young, and single parents who do not plan their pregnan-cies, have little or no knowledge of child development, andhave unrealistic expectations for child behavior.” About10%, or perhaps as many as 40%, of abusive parents werethemselves physically abused as children, but most abusedchildren do not grow up to be abusive parents.
Types of abuse
PHYSICAL ABUSE. Physical abuse is the nonacciden-
tal infliction of physical injury to a child. The abuser is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 753Child abuseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 753"
"usually a family member or other caretaker, and is more
likely to be male. In 1996, 24% of the confirmed cases ofUnited States child abuse involved physical abuse.
A rare form of physical abuse is Munchausen syn-
drome by proxy, in which a caretaker (most often the
mother) seeks attention by making the child sick orappear to be sick.
SEXUAL ABUSE. Charles F. Johnson defines child
sexual abuse as “any activity with a child, before the ageof legal consent, that is for the sexual gratification of anadult or a significantly older child.” It includes, amongother things, sexual touching and penetration, persuadinga child to expose his or her sexual organs, and allowing achild to view pornography. In most cases the child isrelated to or knows the abuser, and about one in fiveabusers are themselves underage. Sexual abuse was pre-sent in 12% of the confirmed 1996 abuse cases. An esti-mated 20–25% of females and 10–15% of males reportthat they were sexually abused by age 18."
"EMOTIONAL ABUSE. Emotional abuse, according to
Richard D. Krugman, “has been defined as the rejection,ignoring, criticizing, isolation , or terrorizing of children,
all of which have the effect of eroding their self-esteem.”Emotional abuse usually expresses itself in verbal attacksinvolving rejection, scapegoating, belittlement, and soforth. Because it often accompanies other types of abuseand is difficult to prove, it is rarely reported, andaccounted for only 6% of the confirmed 1996 cases.
NEGLECT. Neglect—failure to satisfy a child’s basic"
"NEGLECT. Neglect—failure to satisfy a child’s basic
needs—can assume many forms. Physical neglect is thefailure (beyond the constraints imposed by poverty) toprovide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or supervision.Emotional neglect is the failure to satisfy a child’s nor-mal emotional needs, or behavior that damages a child’snormal emotional and psychological development (suchas permitting drug abuse in the home). Failing to see thata child receives proper schooling or medical care is alsoconsidered neglect. In 1996 neglect was the finding in52% of the confirmed abuse cases.
Causes and symptoms
Physical abuse
The usual physical abuse scenario involves a parent
who loses control and lashes out at a child. The triggermay be normal child behavior such as crying or dirtyinga diaper. Unlike nonabusive parents, who may becomeangry at or upset with their children from time to timebut are genuinely loving, abusive parents tend to harbordeep-rooted negative feelings toward their children."
"Unexplained or suspicious bruises or other marks
on the skin are typical signs of physical abuse, as areburns . Skull and other bone fractures are often seen
in young abused children, and in fact, head injuries arethe leading cause of death from abuse. Children less
than one year old are particularly vulnerable to injuryfrom shaking. This is called shaken baby syndrome
or shaken impact syndrome. Not surprisingly, physicalabuse also causes a wide variety of behavioral changesin children.
Sexual abuse
John M. Leventhal observes, “The two prerequisites
for this form of maltreatment include sexual arousal tochildren and the willingness to act on this arousal. Fac-tors that may contribute to this willingness include alco-hol or drug abuse, poor impulse control, and a belief thatthe sexual behaviors are acceptable and not harmful tothe child.” The chances of abuse are higher if the child isdevelopmentally handicapped or vulnerable in someother way."
"Genital or anal injuries or abnormalities (including
the presence of sexually transmitted diseases ) can be
signs of sexual abuse, but often there is no physical evi-dence for a doctor to find. In fact, physical examinationsof children in cases of suspected sexual abuse supplygrounds for further suspicion only 15–20% of the time.Anxiety , poor academic performance, and suicidal con-
duct are some of the behavioral signs of sexual abuse, butare also found in children suffering other kinds of stress .
Excessive masturbation and other unusually sexualizedkinds of behavior are more closely associated with sexu-al abuse itself.
Emotional abuse
Emotional abuse can happen in many settings: at
home, at school, on sports teams, and so on. Some of thepossible symptoms include loss of self-esteem, sleep dis-turbances, headaches or stomachaches, school avoid-ance, and running away from home.

"Neglect
Many cases of neglect occur because the parent
experiences strong negative feelings toward the child.At other times, the parent may truly care about thechild, but lack the ability or strength to adequately pro-vide for the child’s needs because he or she is handi-capped by depression, drug abuse, mental retardation ,
or some other problem.
Neglected children often do not receive adequate
nourishment or emotional and mental stimulation. As aresult, their physical, social, emotional, and mentaldevelopment is hindered. They may, for instance, be

"underweight, develop language skills less quickly than
other children, and seem emotionally needy.
Diagnosis
Doctors and many other professionals who work
with children are required by law to report suspectedabuse to their state’s Child Protective Services (CPS)agency. Abuse investigations are often a group effortinvolving medical personnel, social workers, police
officers, and others. Some hospitals and communitiesmaintain child protection teams that respond to casesof possible abuse. Careful questioning of the parentsis crucial, as is interviewing the child (if he or she iscapable of being interviewed). The investigatorsmust ensure, however, that their questioning does notfurther traumatize the child. A physical examination
for signs of abuse or neglect is, of course, always

"necessary, and may include x rays, blood tests, and
other procedures.
Treatment
Notification of the appropriate authorities, treatment
of the child’s injuries, and protecting the child from fur-ther harm are the immediate priorities in abuse cases. Ifthe child does not require hospital treatment, protectionoften involves placing him or her with relatives or in fos-ter care. Once the immediate concerns are dealt with, itbecomes essential to determine how the child’s long-term medical, psychological, educational, and otherneeds can best be met, a process that involves evaluatingnot only the child’s needs but also the family’s (such asfor drug abuse counseling or parental skills training). Ifthe child has brothers or sisters, the authorities mustdetermine whether they have been abused as well. Oninvestigation, signs of physical abuse are discovered inabout 20% of the brothers and sisters of abused children.

"Prognosis
Child abuse can have lifelong consequences.
Research shows that abused children and adolescents aremore likely, for instance, to do poorly in school, sufferemotional problems, develop an antisocial personality,become promiscuous, abuse drugs and alcohol, andattempt suicide. As adults they often have trouble estab-lishing intimate relationships. Whether professional treat-ment is able to moderate the long-term psychologicaleffects of abuse is a question that remains unanswered.
Prevention
Government efforts to prevent abuse include home-
visitor programs aimed at high-risk families and school-based efforts to teach children how to respond to attempt-ed sexual abuse. Emotional abuse prevention has beenpromoted through the media.

Childbirth
Definition
Childbirth includes both labor (the process of birth)
and delivery (the birth itself); it refers to the entireprocess as an infant makes its way from the womb downthe birth canal to the outside world.
Description
Childbirth usually begins spontaneously, following
about 280 days after conception, but it may be started byartificial means if the pregnancy continues past 42
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 756ChildbirthGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 756"
"weeks gestation. The average length of labor is about 14
hours for a first pregnancy and about eight hours in sub-sequent pregnancies. However, many women experiencea much longer or shorter labor.
Labor can be described in terms of a series of phases.
First stage of labor
During the first phase of labor, the cervix dilates
(opens) from 0–10 cm. This phase has an early, or latent,phase and an active phase. During the latent phase,progress is usually very slow. It may take quite a whileand many contractions before the cervix dilates the firstfew centimeters. Contractions increase in strength aslabor progresses. Most women are relatively comfortableduring the latent phase and walking around is encour-aged, since it naturally stimulates the process.
As labor begins, the muscular wall of the uterus"
"As labor begins, the muscular wall of the uterus
begins to contract as the cervix relaxes and expands. As aportion of the amniotic sac surrounding the baby is pushedinto the opening, it bursts under the pressure, releasingamniotic fluid. This is called “breaking the bag of waters.”
During a contraction, the infant experiences intense
pressure that pushes it against the cervix, eventually forc-ing the cervix to stretch open. At the same time, the con-tractions cause the cervix to thin. During this first stage, awoman’s contractions occur more and more often and lastlonger and longer. The doctor or nurse will do a periodicpelvic exam to determine how the mother is progressing.
If the contractions aren’t forceful enough to open thecervix, a drug may be given to make the uterus contract.
As pain and discomfort increase, women may be"
"As pain and discomfort increase, women may be
tempted to request pain medication. If possible, though,administration of pain medication or anesthetics shouldbe delayed until the active phase of labor begins—atwhich point the medication will not act to slow down orstop the labor.
The active stage of labor is faster and more efficient
than the latent phase. In this phase, contractions arelonger and more regular, usually occurring about everytwo minutes. These stronger contractions are also morepainful. Women who use the breathing exercises learnedin childbirth classes find that these can help cope withthe pain experienced during this phase. Many womenalso receive some pain medication at this point—either ashort-term medication, such as Nubain or Numorphan, oran epidural anesthesia.
As the cervix dilates to 8–9 cm, the phase called the"
"As the cervix dilates to 8–9 cm, the phase called the
transition begins. This refers to the transition from thefirst phase (during which the cervix dilates from 0–10cm) and the second phase (during which the baby ispushed out through the birth canal). As the baby’s headbegins to descend, women begin to feel the urge to
“push” or bear down. Active pushing by the mothershould not begin until the second phase, since pushingtoo early can cause the cervix to swell or to tear andbleed. The attending healthcare practitioner should coun-sel the mother on when to begin to push.

"Second stage of labor
As the mother enters the second stage of labor, her
baby’s head appears at the top of the cervix. Uterine con-tractions get stronger. The infant passes down the vagina,helped along by contractions of the abdominal musclesand the mother’s pushing. Active pushing by the motheris very important during this phase of labor. If an epidur-al anesthetic is being used, many practitioners recom-mend decreasing the amount administered during thisphase of labor so that the mother has better control overher abdominal muscles.
When the top of the baby’s head appears at the open-"
"When the top of the baby’s head appears at the open-
ing of the vagina, the birth is nearing completion. Firstthe head passes under the pubic bone. It fills the lowervagina and stretches the perineum (the tissues betweenthe vagina and the rectum). This position is called“crowning,” since only the crown of the head is visible.When the entire head is out, the shoulders follow. Theattending practitioner suctions the baby’s mouth andnose to ease the baby’s first breath. The rest of the babyusually slips out easily, and the umbilical cord is cut.
Episiotomy
As the baby’s head appears, the perineum may
stretch so tight that the baby’s progress is slowed down. Ifthere is risk of tearing the mother’s skin, the doctor maychoose to make a small incision into the perineum to

"enlarge the vaginal opening. This is called an episiotomy .
If the woman has not had an epidural or pudendal block,she will get a local anesthetic to numb the area. Once theepisiotomy is made, the baby is born with a few pushes.
Third stage
In the final stage of labor, the placenta is pushed out
of the vagina by the continuing uterine contractions. Theplacenta is pancake shaped and about 10 inches in diam-eter. It has been attached to the wall of the uterus and hasserved to convey nourishment from the mother to thefetus throughout the pregnancy. Continuing uterine con-tractions cause it to separate from the uterus at this point.It is important that all of the placenta be removed fromthe uterus. If it is not, the uterine bleeding that is normalafter delivery may be much heavier.

"Breech presentation
Approximately 4% of babies are in what is called
the “breech” position when labor begins. In breech pre-sentation, the baby’s head is not the part pressing againstthe cervix. Instead the baby’s bottom or legs are posi-tioned to enter the birth canal instead of the head. Anobstetrician may attempt to turn the baby to a head downposition using a technique called version. This is onlysuccessful approximately half the time.
The risks of vaginal delivery with breech presentation
are much higher than with a head-first presentation and themother and attending practitioner will need to weigh therisks and make a decision on whether to deliver via acesarean section or attempt a vaginal birth. The extent of"
"the risk depends to a great extent on the type of breech pre-sentation—of which there are three. Frank breech (thebaby’s legs are folded up against its body) is the most com-mon and the safest for vaginal delivery. The other types arecomplete breech (in which the baby’s legs are crossed
under and in front of the body) and footling breech (inwhich one leg or both legs are positioned to enter the birthcanal) are not considered safe to attempt vaginal delivery.
Even in complete breech, other factors should be
met before considering a vaginal birth. An ultrasoundexamination should be done to be sure the baby does nothave an unusually large head and that the head is tiltedforward (flexed) rather than back (hyperextended). Fetalmonitoring and close observation of the progress of laborare also important. A slowing of labor or any indicationof difficulty in the body passing through the pelvisshould be an indication that it is safer to consider acesarean section.
Forceps delivery"
"Forceps delivery
If the labor is not progressing as it should or if the
baby appears to be in distress, the doctor may opt for aforceps delivery. A forceps is a spoon-shaped device thatresembles a set of salad tongs. It is placed around thebaby’s head so the doctor can pull the baby gently out ofthe vagina.
Forceps can be used after the cervix is fully dilated,
and they might be required if:
• the umbilical cord has dropped down in front of the
baby into the birth canal
• the baby is too large to pass through the birth canal
unaided
• the baby shows signs of stress
• the mother is too exhausted to push
Before placing the forceps around the baby’s head,
pain medication or anesthesia may be given to the moth-er. The doctor may use a catheter to empty the mother’sbladder, and may clean the perineal area with soapywater. Often an episiotomy is done before a forceps birth,although tears can still occur.
The obstetrician slides half of the forceps at a time"
"The obstetrician slides half of the forceps at a time
into the vagina and around the side of the baby’s head togently grasp the head. When both “tongs” are in place, thedoctor pulls on the forceps to help the baby through thebirth canal as the uterus contracts. Sometimes the babycan be delivered this way after the very next contraction.
The frequency of forceps delivery varies from one
hospital to the next, depending on the experience of staffand the types of anesthesia offered at the hospital. Someobstetricians accept the need for a forceps delivery as away to avoid cesarean birth. However, other obstetricalservices don’t use forceps at all.
Complications from forceps deliveries can occur.
Sometimes they may cause nerve damage or temporary

Vacu-um-assisted birth can only be used after the cervix isfully dilated (expanded), and the head of the fetus hasbegun to descend through the pelvis. In this procedure,the doctor uses a device called a vacuum extractor, plac-ing a large rubber or plastic cup against the baby’s head.A pump creates suction that gently pulls on the cup toease the baby down the birth canal. The force of the suc-tion may cause a bruise on the baby’s head, but it fadesaway in a day or so.
The vacuum extractor is not as likely as forceps to"
"The vacuum extractor is not as likely as forceps to
injure the mother, and it leaves more room for the babyto pass through the pelvis. However, there may be prob-lems in maintaining the suction during the vacuum-assisted birth, so forceps may be a better choice if it isimportant to remove the baby quickly.
Cesarean sections
A cesarean section, also called a c-section, is a surgi-
cal procedure in which incisions are made through awoman’s abdomen and uterus to deliver her baby.
Cesarean sections are performed whenever abnor-
mal conditions complicate labor and vaginal delivery,threatening the life or health of the mother or the baby.The procedure is performed in the United States on near-ly one of every four babies delivered—more than900,000 babies each year. The procedure is used in caseswhere the mother has had a previous c-section and thearea of the incision has been weakened. Dystocia, or dif-ficult labor, is the another common reason for perform-ing a c-section."
"Difficult labor is commonly caused by one of the
three following conditions: abnormalities in the mother’sbirth canal; abnormalities in the position of the fetus;abnormalities in the labor, including weak or infrequentcontractions.
Another major factor is fetal distress, a condition
where the fetus is not getting enough oxygen. Fetal braindamage can result from oxygen deprivation. Fetal dis-tress is often related to abnormalities in the position ofthe fetus, or abnormalities in the birth canal, causingreduced blood flow through the placenta.
Other conditions also can make c-section advisable,
such as vaginal herpes, hypertension (high blood pres-
sure) and diabetes in the mother.Causes and symptoms
One of the first signs of approaching childbirth may
be a “bloody show,” the appearance of a small amount ofblood-tinged mucus released from the cervix as it beginsto dilate. This is called the “mucus plug.”
The most common sign of the onset of labor is con-"
"The most common sign of the onset of labor is con-
tractions. Sometimes women have trouble telling the dif-ference between true and false labor pains.
True labor pains:
• develop a regular pattern, with contractions coming
closer together
• last from 15–30 seconds at the onset and get progres-
sively stronger and longer (up to 60 seconds)
• may get stronger with physical activity• occur high up on the abdomen, radiating throughout the
abdomen and lower back
Another sign that labor is beginning is the breaking
of the “bag of waters,” the amniotic sac which had cush-ioned the baby during the pregnancy. When it breaks, itreleases water in a trickle or a gush. Only about 10% ofwomen actually experience this water flow in the begin-ning of labor, however. Most of the time, the ruptureoccurs sometime later in labor. If the amniotic sac doesn’trupture on its own, the doctor will break it during labor.
Some women have diarrhea or nausea as labor"
"Some women have diarrhea or nausea as labor
begins. Others notice a sudden surge of energy and theurge to clean or arrange things right before labor begins;this is known as “nesting.”
Diagnosis
The onset of labor can be determined by measuring
how much the cervix has dilated. The degree of dilationis estimated by feeling the opening cervix during a pelvicexam. Dilation is measured in centimeters, from zero to

Fetal monitoring
Fetal monitoring is a process in which the baby’s
heart rate is monitored for indicators of stress during laborand birth. There are several types of fetal monitoring.
A special stethoscope called a fetoscope may be
used. This is a simple and non-invasive method.
The Doppler method uses ultrasound; it involves a
handheld listening device that transmits the sounds of theheart rate through a speaker or into an attached ear piece.It can usually pick up the heart sounds 12 weeks afterconception. This method offers intermittent monitoring.It allows the mother freedom to move about and is alsouseful during contractions.
Electronic fetal monitoring uses ultrasound and
provides a view of the heartbeat in relationship to themother’s contractions. It can be used either continuouslyor intermittently. It is often used in high risk pregnan-cies, and is not often recommended for low risk onesKEY TERMS"
"Amniotic sac —The membranous sac that sur-
rounds the embryo and fills with watery fluid aspregnancy advances.
Breech birth —Birth of a baby bottom-first, instead
of the usual head first delivery. This can add tolabor and delivery problems because the baby’sbottom doesn’t mold a passage through the birthcanal as well as does the head.
Cervix —A small cylindrical organ about an inch
or so long and less than an inch around that makesup the lower part and neck of the uterus. Thecervix separates the body and cavity of the uterusfrom the vagina.
Embryo —The unborn child during the first eight
weeks of its development following conception.

Internal monitoring does not use ultrasound, is more
accurate than electronic monitoring and provides continu-ous monitoring for the high risk mother. This requires themother’s water to be broken and that she be two to threecentimeters dilated. It is used in high-risk situations only.
Telemetry monitoring is the newest type of monitor-
ing. It uses radio waves transmitted from an instrumenton the mother’s thigh. The mother is able to remainmobile. It provides continuous monitoring and is used inhigh-risk situations.

"Treatment
Most women choose some type of pain relief during
childbirth, ranging from relaxation and imagery to drugs.The specific choice may depend on what’s available, thewoman’s preferences, her doctor’s recommendations,and how the labor is proceeding. All drugs have somerisks and some advantages.
Regional anesthetics
Regional anesthetics include epidurals and spinals.
In this technique, medication is injected into the spacearound the spinal nerves. Depending on the type of med-ications used, this type of anesthesia can block nerve sig-nals, causing temporary pain relief, or a loss of sensationfrom the waist down. An epidural or spinal block canprovide complete pain relief during cesarean birth.

"An epidural is placed with the woman lying on her
side or sitting up in bed with the back rounded to allowmore space between the vertebrae. Her back is scrubbedwith antiseptic, and a local anesthetic is injected in theskin to numb the site. The needle is inserted between twovertebrae and through the tough tissue in front of thespinal column. A catheter is put in place that allows con-tinuous doses of anesthetic to be given.
This type of anesthesia provides complete pain
relief, and can help conserve a woman’s energy, since shecan relax or even sleep during labor. This type of anes-thesia does require an IV and fetal monitor. It may beharder for a woman to bear down when it comes time topush, although the amount of anesthesia can be adjustedas this stage nears.
Spinal anesthesia operates on the same principle as"
"Spinal anesthesia operates on the same principle as
epidural anesthesia, and is used primarily in cases of c-section delivery. It is administered in the same way as anepidural, but the catheter is not left in place. The amountof anesthetic injected is large, since it must be injected atone time. Because of the anesthetic’s effect on motornerves, most women using it cannot push during delivery.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 760ChildbirthGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 760"
"This is a disadvantage in labor, but not an issue during a c-
section. Spinals provide quick and strong anesthesia andallow for major abdominal surgery with almost no pain.
Narcotics
Short-acting narcotics can ease pain and don’t inter-
fere with a woman’s ability to push. However, they cancause sedation ,dizziness , nausea, and vomiting. Narcotics
cross the placenta and may slow down a baby’s breathing;they can’t be given too close to the time of delivery.
Natural childbirth and preparation for childbirth
There are several methods to prepare for childbirth.
The one selected often depends on what is availablethrough the healthcare provider. Overall, family involve-ment is receiving increased attention by the healthcaresystems, and many hospitals now offer birthing roomsand maternity centers to help the entire family. There areseveral choices available for childbirth preparation.
Lamaze, or Lamaze-Pavlov, is the most common in"
"Lamaze, or Lamaze-Pavlov, is the most common in
the United States today. It was the first popular naturalchildbirth method, becoming popular in the 1960s.Breathing exercises and concentration on a focal pointare practiced to allow mothers to control pain whilemaintaining consciousness. This allows the flow of oxy-gen to the baby and to the muscles in the uterus to bemaintained. A partner coaches the mother throughout thebirthing process.
The Read method, named for Dick Read, is a tech-
nique of breathing that was originated in the 1930s tohelp mothers deal with apprehension and tension associ-ated with childbirth. This natural childbirth method usesdifferent breathing for the different stages of childbirth.

"The LeBoyer method stresses a relaxed delivery in a
quiet, dim room. It attempts to avoid overstimulation ofthe baby and to foster mother-child bonding by placingthe baby on the mother’s abdomen and having the mothermassage him or her immediately after the birth. Then thefather washes the baby in a warm bath.
The Bradley method is called father-coached child-
birth, because it focuses on the father serving as coachthroughout the process. It encourages normal activitiesduring the first stages of labor.

Children’s health
Definition
Children’s health encompasses the physical, mental,
emotional, and social well-being of children from infan-cy through adolescence.
Description
All children should have regular well-child check
ups according to the schedule recommended by theirphysician or pediatrician. The American Academy ofPediatrics (AAP) advises that children be seen for well-baby check ups at two weeks, two months, four months,six months, nine months, twelve months, fifteen months,and eighteen months. Well-child visits are recommendedat ages two, three, four, five, six, eight, ten, and annuallythereafter through age 21.

• Pneumococcal Conjugate. Three doses.• Measles, Mumps ,Rubella (MMR). One dose.
• Varicella (chickenpox). One dose.• Hepatitis A. (In certain geographical areas and with
certain high risk groups.)
Some immunizations may cause mild side effects, or
more rarely, serious adverse reactions. However, the ben-efits of immunization greatly outweigh the incidence ofhealth problems arising from them.
There are serious chronic diseases and health prob-
lems that are frequently diagnosed in childhood and can-not be vaccinated against. These include, but are not lim-ited to, asthma , type I diabetes (juvenile diabetes),

"Emotional and social health
Children take their first significant steps toward
socialization and peer interaction when they begin toengage in cooperative play at around age four. Theirsocial development will progress throughout childhoodand adolescence as they develop friendships, start to beinfluenced by their peers, and begin to show interest inthe opposite sex.
Factors which can have a negative impact on the
emotional and social well-being of children include:
• Violence. Bullying can cause serious damage to a
child’s sense of self-esteem and personal safety, as canexperiences with school violence.
• Family turmoil. Divorce, death , and other life-chang-
ing events that alter the family dynamic can have a seri-ous impact on a child. Even a positive event such as thebirth of a sibling or a move to a new city and school canput emotional strain on a child.

in extracurricular activities such as sports can be over-whelming to some children.• Peer pressure. Although it can have a positive impact,
peer pressure is often a source of significant stress forchildren. This is particularly true in adolescence when“fitting in” seems all-important.
• Drugs and alcohol. Curiosity is intrinsic to childhood,
and over 30% of children have experimented with alco-hol by age 13. Open communication with children thatsets forth parental expectations about drug and alcoholuse is essential.

DR. BENJAMIN SPOCK (1903–1998)
Benjamin Spock, pediatrician and political activist,
was most noted for his authorship of Baby and Child
Care, which significantly changed predominant attitudestoward the raising of infants and children. He began med-"
"ical school at Yale University in 1925, and transferred toColumbia University’s College of Physicians and Sur-geons in 1927. Spock had decided well before starting hismedical studies that he would “work with children, whohave their whole lives ahead of them” and so, upon tak-ing his M.D. degree in 1929 and serving his generalinternship at the prestigious Presbyterian Hospital, hespecialized in pediatrics at a small hospital crowded withchildren in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen area.

"On a summer vacation in 1943 he began to write his
most famous book and he continued to work on it from1944 to 1946 while serving as a medical officer in theNavy. The book sharply broke with the authoritarian toneand rigorous instructions found in earlier generations ofbaby-care books, most of which said to feed infants on astrict schedule and not to pick them up when they cried.Spock, who spent ten years trying to reconcile his psycho-analytic training with what mothers were telling him abouttheir children, told his readers “Y ou know more than youthink you do. Don’t be afraid to trust your own commonsense. Take it easy, trust your own instincts, and follow thedirections that your doctor gives you.” The response wasoverwhelming. Baby and Child Care rapidly became
America’s all-time best-seller except for Shakespeare andthe Bible; by 1976 it had also eclipsed Shakespeare.

"Physical and mental health problems in childhood
can cause a wide spectrum of symptoms. However, thefollowing behaviors frequently signify a larger emotion-al, social, or mental disturbance:
• signs of alcohol and drug use
• falling grades

able to the child
• excessive anxiety
• persistent, prolonged depression
• withdrawal from friends and family• violence• temper tantrums or inappropriate displays of anger
• self-inflicted injury
• bizarre behavior and/or speech• trouble with the police
• sexual promiscuity
• suicide attempts
The causes of developmental disorders and delays

"• Social interaction. Autistic children are often unaware
of acceptable social behavior and are withdrawn andsocially isolated. They frequently do not like physicalcontact.
• Communication and language. A child with autism or
PDD may not speak or may display limited or imma-ture language skills.
• Behavior. Autistic or PDD children may have difficulty
dealing with anger, can be self-injurious, and may dis-play obsessive behavior.
Autism is associated with brain abnormalities, but
the exact mechanisms that trigger the disorder are yet tobe determined. It has been linked to certain congenitalconditions such as neurofibromatosis ,fragile X syn-

"drome , and phenylketonuria (PKU).
Diagnosis
Physical, intellectual, emotional, and social matura-
tion are all important markers of a child’s overall healthand well-being. When evaluating children, pediatriciansand child-care specialists assess related skill sets, such asa child’s acquisition and use of language, fine and grossmotor skills, cognitive growth, and socialization, andachievement of certain milestones in these areas. A
developmental milestone is a task or skill set that a childis expected to reach at a certain age or stage of life. Forexample, by age one, most children have achieved thephysical milestone of walking with the assistance of anadult. Developmental disorders may be identified and/ordiagnosed by physicians, teachers, child psychologists,therapists, counselors, and other professionals who inter-act with children on a regular basis.

"It is important to remember that all children are
unique, and develop at different paces within this broadframework. Reaching a milestone early or late does notnecessarily indicate a developmental problem. However,if a child is consistently lagging on achieving milestones,or has a significant deficit in one developmental area, heor she may be experiencing developmental delays.
Pediatricians and other medical professionals typi-
cally diagnose physical illness and disease in children. Incases of illness and injury, children will undergo a thor-ough physical examination and patient history. Diag-
nostic tests may be performed as appropriate. In cases ofmental or emotional disorders, a psychologist or othermental healthcare professional will meet with the patientto conduct an interview and take a detailed social andmedical history. Interviews with a parent or guardianmay also be part of the diagnostic process. The physicianmay also administer one or more psychological tests"
"(also called clinical inventories, scales, or assessments).
Treatment
Medications may be prescribed to treat certain child-
hood illnesses. Proper dosage is particularly importantwith infants and children, as medications such as aceta-
minophen can be toxic in excessive amounts. Parents
and caregivers should always follow the instructions foruse that accompany medications, and inform the child’spediatrician if the child is taking any other drugs or vita-
mins to prevent potentially negative drug interactions.
Any side effects or adverse reactions to medicationshould be reported to the child’s physician. If antibiotics
are prescribed, the full course should always be taken.
Other treatments for childhood illness and/or injuries
include, but are not limited to, nutritional therapy, physicaltherapy, respiratory therapy, medical devices (e.g., hear-
ing aids , glasses, braces), and in some cases, surgery.

scribed for symptom relief in children and adolescentswith mental disorders.
Support groups may also provide emotional support
for children with chronic illnesses or mental disorders.This approach, which allows individuals to seek adviceand counsel from others in similar circumstances, can beextremely effective, especially in older children wholook towards their peers for guidance and support.

Certain mild herbal remedies may also be safely
used with children, such as ginger ( Zingiber officinale )
tea for nausea and aloe vera salve for burns . Parents and
caregivers should always consult their healthcareprovider before administering herbs to children.

"Some learning disabilities and mild developmental
disorders can be overcome or greatly improved throughthe therapies discussed above. However, as of early 2001,there was no known medical treatment or pharmacologi-cal therapy that is capable of completely eliminating allof the symptoms associated with pervasive developmen-
tal disorder (PDD), autism spectrum disorder, and mentalretardation. Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia andbipolar disorder are also chronic, lifelong disorders,although their symptoms can often be well-controlledwith medication.
Prevention
Parents can take some precautions to ensure the
safety of their children. Childproofing the home, follow-ing a recommended immunization schedule, educatingkids on safety, learning CPR , and taking kids for regular"

Because they are still developing motor skills, kids
can be particularly accident prone. Observe the followingsafety rules to protect children from injury:
• Helmets and padding. Children should always wear a
properly fitted helmet and appropriate protective gearwhen riding a bike, scooter, or similar equipment orparticipating in sports. They should also ride on desig-nated bike paths whenever possible, and learn bicyclesafety rules (i.e., ride with traffic, use hand signals).

"• Playground safety. Swing sets and other outdoor play
equipment should be well-maintained have at least 12in (30 cm) of loose fill materials (e.g., sand, woodchips) underneath to cushion falls, and children shouldalways be properly supervised at play.
• Stay apprised of recalls. Children’s toys, play equip-
ment, and care products are frequently involved inproduct recalls. The U.S. Consumer Safety ProductsCommission (CSPC) is the agency responsible fortracking these recalls (see Resources below).
• Stay safe in the car. Up to 85% of children’s car seats
are improperly installed and/or used. Infants shouldalways be in a rear-facing car seat until they are over 12months of age and weigh more than 20 lb (9 kg). Never

• Teach children pedestrian safety. Younger children
should never be allowed to cross the street by them-selves, and older kids should know to follow trafficsigns and signals, cross the street at the corner, and lookboth ways before stepping off the curb.
• Teach children about personal safety. Kids should know

Chiropractic
Definition
Chiropractic is from Greek words meaning done by
hand. It is grounded in the principle that the body canheal itself when the skeletal system is correctly alignedand the nervous system is functioning properly. Toachieve this, the practitioner uses his or her hands or anadjusting tool to perform specific manipulations of thevertebrae. When these bones of the spine are not correct-ly articulated, resulting in a condition known as subluxa-tion, the theory is that nerve transmission is disruptedand causes pain and illness manifested in the back as

Chiropractic is one of the most popular alternative
therapies currently available. Some would say it nowqualifies as mainstream treatment as opposed to comple-mentary medicine. Chiropractic treatment is covered bymany insurance plans. It has become well-accepted treat-ment for acute pain and problems of the spine, includinglower back pain and whiplash . Applications beyond that
scope are not supported by current evidence, althoughthere are ongoing studies into the usefulness of chiroprac-tic for such problems as ear infections, dysmenorrhea ,
infant colic , migraine headaches, and other conditions.
Purpose
Most people will experience back pain at some time"
"in their lives. Injuries due to overexertion and poor pos-ture are among the most common. Depending on thecause and severity of the condition, options for treatmentmay include physical therapy, rest, medications, surgery,or chiropractic care. Chiropractic treatment carries noneof the risks of surgical or pharmacologic treatment. Prac-titioners use a holistic approach to health, which isappreciated by most patients. The goal is not merely torelieve the present ailment, but to analyze the cause andrecommend appropriate changes of lifestyle to preventthe problem from recurring again. They believe in arisk/benefit analysis before use of any intervention. Theodds of an adverse outcome are extremely low. Chiro-practic has proven in several studies to be less expensivethan many more traditional routes such as outpatientphysical therapy.

Description
Origins
Spinal manipulation has a long history in many cul-
tures but Daniel D. Palmer is the founder of modern chi-ropractic theory, dating back to the 1890s. A grocer andmagnetic healer, he applied his knowledge of the nervoussystem and manual therapies in an unusual situation. Onerenowned story concerns Harvey Lillard, a janitor in theoffice where Palmer worked. The man had been deaf for17 years, ever since he had sustained an injury to hisupper spine. Palmer performed an adjustment on a painfulvertebra in the region of the injury and Lillard’s hearingwas reputedly restored. Palmer theorized that all commu-nication from the brain to the rest of the body passesthrough the spinal canal, and areas that are poorly alignedor under stress can cause physical symptoms both in the"
"spine and in other areas of the body. Thus the body hasthe innate intelligence to heal itself when unencumberedby spinal irregularities causing nerve interference. Afterhis success with Lillard, other patients began coming tohim for care, and responded well to adjustments. Thisresulted in Palmer’s further study of the relationshipbetween an optimally functional spine and normal health.
Palmer founded the first chiropractic college in
1897. His son, B. J. Palmer, continued to develop chiro-practic philosophy and practice after his father’s death ."
"B. J. and other faculty members were divided over therole of subluxation in disease. B. J. saw it as the cause ofall disease. The others disagreed and sought a more ratio-nal way of thinking, thus broadening the base of chiro-practic education. From 1910–1920, many other chiro-practic colleges were established. Other innovators,including John Howard, Carl Cleveland, Earl Home-wood, Joseph Janse, Herbert Lee, and Claude Watkins,also helped to advance the profession.
The theories of the Palmers receive somewhat
broader interpretation today. Many chiropractors believethat back pain can be relieved and health restoredthrough chiropractic treatment even in patients who donot have demonstrable subluxations. Scientific develop-ment and research of chiropractic is gaining momentum.The twenty-first century will likely see the metaphysicalconcepts such as innate intelligence give way to morescientific proofs and reform."
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 767ChiropracticGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 767
"Many people besides the Palmers have contributed
to the development of chiropractic theory and technique.Some have gone on to create a variety of procedures andrelated types of therapy that have their roots in chiroprac-tic, including McTimoney-Corley chiropractic, cran-iosacral manipulation, naprapathy, and applied kinesiol-
ogy. Osteopathy is another related holistic discipline
that utilizes spinal and musculoskeletal manipulation as apart of treatment, but osteopathic training is more similarin scope to that of an M.D.
Initial visit
An initial chiropractic exam will most often include a
history and a physical. The patient should be asked aboutwhat the current complaint is, whether there are chronichealth problems, family history of disease, dietary habits,medical care received, and any medications currently"
"being taken. Further, the current complaint should bedescribed in terms of how long it has been a problem,how it has progressed, and whether it is the result of aninjury or occurred spontaneously. Details of how aninjury occurred should be given. The physical examshould evaluate by observation and palpation whether thepainful area has evidence of inflammation or poor align-ment. Range of motion may also be assessed. In the spine,either hypomobility (fixation) or hypermobility may be aproblem. Laboratory analysis is helpful in some cases torule out serious infection or other health issues that mayrequire referral for another type of treatment. Many prac-titioners also insist on x rays during the initial evaluation

"Manipulation
When spinal manipulation is employed, it is generally
done with the hands, although some practitioners may usean adjusting tool. A classic adjustment involves a highvelocity, low amplitude thrust that produces a usuallypainless popping noise, and improves the range of motionof the joint that was treated. The patient may lie on a spe-cially designed, padded table that helps the practitioner toachieve the proper positions for treatment. Some adjust-ments involve manipulating the entire spine, or large por-tions of it, as a unit; others are small movements designedto affect a single joint. Stretching, traction , and slow
manipulation are other techniques that can be employed torestore structural integrity and relieve nerve interference.

"Length of treatment
The number of chiropractic treatments required will
vary depending on several factors. Generally longer-termtreatment is needed for conditions that are chronic,severe, or occur in conjunction with another health prob-lem. Patients who are not in overall good health may alsohave longer healing times. Some injuries will inherentlyrequire more treatments than others in order to get relief.Care is given in three stages. Initially appointments aremore frequent with the goal of relieving immediate pain.Next, the patient moves into a rehabilitative stage to con-tinue the healing process and help to prevent a relapse.Finally, the patient may elect periodic maintenance, orwellness treatments, along with lifestyle changes if need-ed in order to stay in good health.
Follow-up care
Discharge and follow-up therapy are important. If an
injury occurred as a result of poor fitness or health, a pro-gram of exercise or nutrition should be prescribed."

"cations of heat or ice packs. Conscious attention to pos-
ture may help some patients avoid sustaining a similarinjury in the future, and the chiropractor should be ableto discern what poor postural habits require correction. Asedentary lifestyle, particularly with a lot of time spentsitting, is likely to contribute to poor posture and maypredispose a person to back pain and injury.
Types of practitioners
Some practitioners use spinal manipulation to the
exclusion of all other modalities, and are known asstraight chiropractors. Others integrate various types oftherapy such as massage, nutritional intervention, ortreatment with vitamins , herbs, or homeopathic reme-
dies. They also embrace ideas from other health care tra-ditions. This group is known as mixers. The vast majorityof chiropractors, perhaps 85%, fall in this latter category.
Preparations
Patients should enter the chiropractic clinic with an
open mind. This will help to achieve maximum results.
Precautions"
"open mind. This will help to achieve maximum results.
Precautions
Chiropractic is not an appropriate therapy for dis-
eases that are severely degenerative and may requiremedication or surgery. Many conditions of the spine areamenable to manipulative treatment, but that does notinclude fractures . The practitioner should be informed
in advance if the patient is on anticoagulants, or hasosteoporosis or any other condition that may weaken the
bones. There are other circumstances that would con-traindicate chiropractic care, and these should be detect-ed in the history or physical exam. In addition to frac-tures, Down syndrome , some congenital defects, and
some types of cancer are a few of the things that may
preclude spinal manipulation. On rare occasions, a frac-ture or dislocation may occur. There is also a very slimpossibility of experiencing a stroke as a result of spinal
manipulation, but estimates are that it is no more fre-quent than 2.5 occurrences per one million treatments."
"Be wary of chiropractors who insist on costly x rays
and repeated visits with no end in sight. Extensive use isnot scientifically justifiable, especially in most cases oflower back pain. There are some circumstances when xrays are indicated, including acute or possibly severeinjuries such as those that might result from a car accident.
Side effects

form of aches, pains, or spasms for a few days followingDANIEL PALMER (1845–1913)

"Chiropractic inventor, Daniel David Palmer, was
born on March 7, 1845, in Toronto, Ontario. He wasone of five siblings, the children of a shoemaker and hiswife, Thomas and Katherine Palmer. Daniel Palmer andhis older brother fell victim to wanderlust and left Cana-da with a tiny cash reserve in April 1865. They immi-grated to the United States on foot, walking for 30 daysbefore arriving in Buffalo, New York. They traveled byboat through the St. Lawrence Seaway to Detroit, Michi-gan. There they survived by working odd jobs and sleep-ing on the dock. Daniel Palmer settled in What Cheer,Iowa, where he supported himself and his first wife as agrocer and fish peddler in the early 1880s. He latermoved to Davenport, Iowa, where he raised threedaughters and one son.

"Palmer was a man of high curiosity. He investigated
a variety of disciplines of medical science during hislifetime, many of which were in their infancy. He wasintrigued by phrenology and assorted spiritual cults, andfor nine years he investigated the relationship betweenmagnetism and disease. Palmer felt that there was onething that caused disease. He was intent upon discover-ing this one thing, or as he called it: the great secret.
In September 1895, Palmer purported to have cured
a deaf man by placing pressure on the man’s displacedvertebra. Shortly afterward Palmer claimed to cureanother patient of heart trouble, again by adjusting a dis-placed vertebra. The double coincidence led Palmer totheorize that human disease might be the result of dislo-cated or luxated bones, as Palmer called them. Thatsame year he established the Palmer School of Chiro-practic where he taught a three-month course in the sim-ple fundamentals of medicine and spinal adjustment."

died in California in 1913; he was destitute. His son,Bartlett Joshua Palmer, successfully commercialized thepractice of chiropractic.

ence mild headache or fatigue that resolves quickly.
Research and general acceptance
As recently as the 1970s, the American Medical
Association (a national group of medical doctors) wasquite hostile to chiropractic, which it deemed a cult.AMA members were advised that it was unethical to beassociated with chiropractors. Fortunately that haschanged, and as of 2000, many allopathic or traditionallytrained physicians enjoy cordial referral relationshipswith chiropractors. The public is certainly strongly in
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 769ChiropracticGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 769"
"favor of chiropractic treatment. An estimated 15% of
people in the United States used chiropractic care in1997. Chiropractors see the lion’s share of all patientswho seek medical help for back problems.
Research has also supported the use of spinal manip-
ulation for acute low back pain. There is some anecdotalevidence recommending chiropractic treatment for ail-ments unrelated to musculoskeletal problems, but there isnot enough research-based data to support this. On theother hand, a chiropractor may be able to treat problemsand diseases unrelated to the skeletal structure byemploying therapies other than spinal manipulation.
Although many chiropractors limit their practice to
spine and joint problems, others claim to treat disordersthat are not closely related to the back or musculoskeletalsystem. These include asthma ,bed-wetting ,bronchitis ,
coughs, dizziness , dysmenorrhea, earache, fainting ,

There are at least three explanations for possible efficacyfor these conditions. One is that the problem could belinked to a nerve impingement, as may be possible withbed-wetting, dizziness, fainting, and headache. In a sec-ond group, chiropractic treatment may offer some relieffrom complicating pain and spasms caused by the dis-ease process, as with asthma, bronchitis, coughs, andpneumonia. The discomforts of pregnancy may also berelieved with gentle chiropractic therapy. A third possi-bility is that manipulation or use of soft-tissue techniquesmay directly promote improvement of some conditions.One particular procedure, known as the endonasal tech-nique, is thought to help the eustachian tube to open andthus improve drainage of the middle ear.

Chlamydial pneumonia
Definition
Chlamydial pneumonia refers to one of several
types of pneumonia that can be caused by various typesof the bacteria known as Chlamydia .
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 770Chlamydial pneumoniaGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 770"
"Description
Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. The air sacs
(alveoli) and/or the tissues of the lungs become swollen,and the alveoli may fill with pus or fluid. This prevents thelungs from taking in sufficient oxygen, which deprives theblood and the rest of the body’s tissues of oxygen.
There are three major types of Chlamydia :Chlamy-
dia psittaci ,Chlamydia pneumoniae , and Chlamydia tra-
chomatis . Each of these has the potential to cause a type
of pneumonia.
Causes and symptoms
Chlamydia trachomatis is a major cause of sexually
transmitted diseases (called nongonococcal urethritis
and pelvic inflammatory disease ). When a woman with
an active chlamydial infection gives birth to a baby, thebaby may aspirate (suck into his or her lungs) some ofthe mother’s bacteria-laden secretions while passingthrough the birth canal. This can cause a form of relative-ly mild pneumonia in the newborn, occurring about twoto six weeks after delivery."
"Chlamydia psittaci is a bacteria carried by many
types of birds, including pigeons, canaries, parakeets, par-rots, and some gulls. Humans acquire the bacteria throughcontact with dust from bird feathers, bird droppings, orfrom the bite of a bird carrying the bacteria. People whokeep birds as pets or who work where birds are kept havethe highest risk for this type of pneumonia. This pneumo-nia, called psittacosis, causes fever ,cough , and the pro-
duction of sputum containing pus. This type of pneumo-nia may be quite severe, and is usually more serious inolder patients. The illness can last several weeks.
Chlamydia pneumoniae usually causes a type of rel-
atively mild “walking pneumonia.” Patients experiencefever and cough. This type of pneumonia is called a“community-acquired pneumonia” because it is easilypassed from one member of the community to another.
Diagnosis
Laboratory tests indicating the presence of one of
the strains of Chlamydia are sophisticated, expensive,"
"the strains of Chlamydia are sophisticated, expensive,
and performed in only a few laboratories across thecountry. For this reason, doctors diagnose most cases ofchlamydial pneumonia by performing a physical exami-
nation of the patient, and noting the presence of certain
factors. For instance, if the mother of a baby sick withpneumonia is positive for a sexually transmitted diseasecaused by Chlamydia trachomatis , the diagnosis is obvi-
ous. History of exposure to birds in a patient sick withpneumonia suggests that Chlamydia psittaci may be theculprit. A mild pneumonia in an otherwise healthy per-
son is likely to be a community-acquired walking pneu-monia, such as that caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae .
Treatment
Treatment varies depending on the specific type of
Chlamydia causing the infection. A newborn with
Chlamydia trachomatis improves rapidly with ery-
thromycin. Chlamydia psittaci infection is treated with"
"thromycin. Chlamydia psittaci infection is treated with
tetracycline, bed rest, oxygen supplementation, andcodeine-containing cough preparations. Chlamydia
pneumoniae infection is treated with erythromycin.
Prognosis
The prognosis is generally excellent for the newborn
with Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia. Chlamydia
psittaci may linger, and severe cases have a death rate of
as high as 30%. The elderly are hardest hit by this type ofpneumonia. A young, healthy person with Chlamydia
pneumoniae has an excellent prognosis. In the elderly,
however, there is a 5–10% death rate from this infection.
Prevention
Prevention of Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia
involves recognizing the symptoms of genital infection inthe mother and treating her prior to delivery of her baby.

"Chlamydia psittaci can be prevented by warning peo-
ple who have birds as pets, or who work around birds, tobe careful to avoid contact with the dust and droppings ofthese birds. Sick birds can be treated with an antibiotic intheir feed. Because people can contract psittacosis fromeach other, a person sick with this infection should bekept in isolation , so as not to infect other people.
Chlamydia pneumoniae is difficult to prevent
because it is spread by respiratory droplets from othersick people. Because people with this type of pneumoniado not always feel very sick, they often continue toattend school, go to work, and go to other public places.They then spread the bacteria in the tiny droplets that arereleased into the air during coughing. Therefore, thispneumonia is very difficult to prevent and often occurs inoutbreaks within communities.

Choking
Definition
Choking is the inability to breathe because the tra-
chea is blocked, constricted, or swollen shut.
Description
Choking is a medical emergency. When a person is
choking, air cannot reach the lungs. If the airways cannotbe cleared, death follows rapidly.
Anyone can choke, but choking is more common in
children than in adults. Choking is a common cause ofaccidental death in young children who are apt to put toysor coins in their mouths, then unintentionally inhale them.About 3,000 adults die each year from choking on food.
People also choke because infection causes the"
"People also choke because infection causes the
throat tissue to swell shut. It is believed that this is whatcaused George Washington’s death. Allergic reactionscan also cause the throat to swell shut. Acute allergicreactions are called anaphylactic reactions and may befatal. Strangulation puts external pressure on the tracheacausing another form of choking.
Finally, people can choke from obstructive sleep
apnea . This is a condition where tissues of the body
obstruct the airways during sleep. Sleep apnea is mostcommon in obese men who sleep on their backs. Smok-
ing, heavy alcohol use, lung diseases such as emphyse-
ma, and an inherited tendency toward a narrowed airway
and throat all increase the risk of choking during sleep.
Causes and symptoms
There are three reasons why people choke. These are:
• mechanical obstruction• tissue swelling• crushing of the trachea

"Regardless of the cause, choking cuts off the air sup-
ply to the lungs. Indications that a person’s airway isblocked include:
• the person cannot speak or cry out• the person’s face turns blue from lack of oxygen• the person desperately grabs at his or her throat
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 772ChokingGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 772"
"• the person has a weak cough and labored breathing that
produces a high-pitched noise
• the person has all of the above symptoms, then becomes
unconscious
• during sleep, the person has episodes of gasping, paus-
es in breathing, and sudden awakenings.
Diagnosis
Diagnosing choking due to mechanical obstruction
is straightforward, since the symptoms are obvious evento an untrained person. In choking due to infection, theperson, usually a child, will have a fever and signs of ill-
ness before labored breathing begins. If choking is due toan allergic reaction to medication or insect bites, the per-son’s earlobes and face will swell, giving an external signthat internal swelling is also occurring.
Choking due to sleep apnea is usually diagnosed on
reports of symptoms by the person’s sleep partner. Thereare also alarm devices to detect the occurrence of sleepapnea. Eventually sleep may be interrupted so frequentlythat daytime drowsiness becomes a problem.
Treatment"
"Treatment
Choking, except during sleep apnea, is a medical
emergency. If choking is due to allergic reaction or infec-tion, people should summon emergency help or goimmediately to an emergency room. If choking is due toobstructed airways, the Heimlich maneuver (an emer-
gency procedure in which a person is grasped frombehind in order to forcefully expel the obstruction)should be performed immediately. In severe cases a tra-
cheotomy (an incision into the trachea through the neck
below the larynx) must be performed.
Patients who suffer airway obstruction during sleep
can be treated with a device similar to an oxygen maskthat creates positive airway pressure and delivers a mix-ture of oxygen and air.
Prognosis
Many people are treated successfully for choking
with no permanent effects. However, if treatment isunsuccessful, the person dies from lack of oxygen. Incases where the ariway is restored after the critical periodpasses, there may be permanent brain damage.

Cholangitis
Definition
The term cholangitis means inflammation of the bile
ducts. The term applies to inflammation of any portion ofthe bile ducts, which carry bile from the liver to the gall-bladder and intestine. The inflammation is produced bybacterial infection or sometimes other causes.
Description
Bile, which is needed for digestion, is produced in
the liver and then enters the common bile duct (CBD)through the hepatic ducts. Bile enters the gallbladderbetween meals, when the muscle or sphincter that con-trols flow of bile between the CBD and intestine isclosed. During this period, bile accumulates in the CBD;
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 773CholangitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 773"
"the pressure in the CBD rises, as would a pipe closed off
at one end. The increase in pressure eventually causes thebile to flow into the gallbladder. During meals, the gall-bladder contracts and the sphincter between the gallblad-der and intestine relaxes, permitting bile to flow into theintestine and take part in digestion.
Bile that has just been produced by the liver is sterile
(free of bacteria). This is partly due to its antibacterialproperties; these are produced by the immunoglobulins(antibodies) secreted in bile, the bile acids which inhibitbacterial growth themselves, and mucus.
A small number of bacteria may be present in the bile
ducts and gallbladder, getting there by moving backwardfrom the intestine, which unlike the bile ducts, containslarge numbers of bacteria. The normal flow of bile out ofthe ducts and into the intestine also helps keep too manyorganisms from multiplying. Bacteria also reach the bileducts from the lymph tissue or from the blood stream."
"When the passage of bile out of the ducts is blocked,
the few bacteria that are there rapidly reproduce. A par-tial blockage to the flow of bile can occur when a stonefrom the gallbladder blocks the duct, and also allowsbacteria to flow back into the CBD, and creates idealconditions for their growth. Tumors, on the other hand,cause a more complete blockage of bile flow, both in andout, so fewer infections occur. The reproducing organ-isms are often able to enter the bloodstream and infectmultiple organs such as the liver and heart valves.
Another source of inflammation of the bile ducts
occurs in diseases of altered immunity, known as “autoim-mune diseases.” In these diseases, the body fails to recog-nize certain cells as part of its normal composition. Thebody thinks these cells are foreign and produces antibod-ies to fight them off, just as it fights against bacteria andviruses. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a typical exam-ple of an autoimmune disease involving the bile ducts."
"Causes and symptoms
As noted above, the two things that are needed for
cholangitis to occur are: 1) obstruction to bile flow, and2) presence of bacteria within the bile ducts. The mostcommon cause of cholangitis is infection of the bileducts due to blockage by a gallstone. Strictures (portionsof ducts that have become narrow) also function in thesame way. Strictures may be due to congenital (birth)abnormalities of the bile ducts, form as a result of injuryto the bile duct (such as surgery, trauma), or result frominflammation that leads to scar tissue and narrowing.
The bacterium most commonly associated with infec-
tion of the bile ducts is Escherichia coli (E. coli) which is a
normal inhabitant of the intestine. In some cases, morethan one type of bacteria is involved. Patients with AIDS
can develop infection of narrowed bile ducts with unusualorganisms such as Cryptosporidium and others.
The three symptoms present in about 70% of patients"
"The three symptoms present in about 70% of patients
with cholangitis are abdominal pain,fever , and jaundice .
Some patients only have chills and fever with minimalabdominal symptoms. Jaundice or yellow discoloration ofthe skin and eyes occurs in about 80% of patients. Thecolor change is due to bile pigments that accumulate in theblood and eventually in the skin and eyes.
Inflammation due to the autoimmune disease prima-
ry sclerosing cholangitis leads to multiple areas of nar-rowing and eventual infection. Tumors can block the bileduct and also cause cholangitis, but as noted, infection isrelatively infrequent; in fact cholangitis occurs in onlyabout one in six patients with tumors.
Another type of bile duct infection occurs mainly in"
"Another type of bile duct infection occurs mainly in
Southeast Asia and is known as recurrent pyogeniccholangitis or Oriental cholangitis. It has also been iden-tified in Asians immigrating to North America. Mostpatients have stones in the bile ducts and/or gallbladder,and many cases are associated with the presence of para-sites within the ducts. The role of parasites in causinginfection is not clear. Many researchers believe that theyare just coincidental, and have nothing to do with thestones or infection.
Diagnosis
The above symptoms alone are very suggestive of
cholangitis; however, it is important to determine the exactcause and site of possible obstruction. This is becauseattacks are likely to recur, and different causes require dif-ferent treatments. For example, the treatment of cholangi-tis due to a stone in the CBD is different from that due tobile duct strictures. An elevated white blood count sug-"
"gests infection, but may be normal in 20% of patients.Abnormal or elevated tests of liver function, such as biliru-bin and others are also frequently present. The specificbacteria is sometimes identified from blood cultures.
X-ray techniques
A number of x-ray techniques can make the diagno-
sis of bile duct obstruction; these include ultrasound andcomputed tomography scans (CT scans). However,
ultrasound often cannot tell if an obstruction is due to astricture or stone, missing a stone in about half the cases.CT scans have an even poorer record of stone detection.
Another method of diagnosing and sometimes treat-
ing the cause of bile duct obstruction or narrowing iscalled percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography . In
this procedure, dye is injected into the ducts by means of

"a needle placed into the liver. It is also used to drain bile
and relieve an obstruction.
ENDOSCOPIC TECHNIQUES. An endoscope is a thin
flexible tube that uses a lens or mirror to look at variousparts of the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic retro-
grade cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can accu-
rately determine the cause and site of blockage. It alsohas the advantage of being able to treat the cause ofobstruction, by removing stones and dilating (stretching)strictures. ERCP involves the injection of x-ray dye intothe bile ducts through an endoscope. Endoscopic ultra-sound is another endoscopic alternative, but is not asavailable as ERCP and is not therapeutic.

ized x-ray procedure in which cross-sections of thearea in question can be examined in detail. In eval-uating the bile ducts, iodine-based dye is ofteninjected intravenously.

Endoscopic, radi-ographic and other techniques have made it possible tosuccessfully remove stones and dilate strictures that pre-viously required surgical intervention, often with highmorbidity and mortality.
Radiologic and endoscopic techniques
Just as with diagnosis, treatment of cholangitis
involves a number of similar procedures that differ main-ly in the way the bile ducts are entered. The aims of thesetechniques are immediate relief of obstruction and infec-tion as well as correction of any abnormalities that have
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 775CholangitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 775"
"caused them. It is important to realize that even with
endoscopy, x-ray dye is injected into the ducts and there-fore the radiologist plays a role in both types of proce-dures. When endoscopy is used, the muscle between theintestine and bile duct is widened, to allow stones topass. This is called a sphincterotomy and is often enoughto relieve any obstruction and help clear infection. Thewidening of the muscle is needed if other proceduresinvolving the bile duct are going to be performed.
The above techniques can be summarized as follows:
• Insertion of a catheter or thin flexible tube to drain bile
and relieve obstruction. When performed by insertionof a needle into the liver the technique is called percuta-neous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD); when per-formed endoscopically the catheter exits through thenose and is called a nasobiliary drain.

"• Balloons can be inserted into the ducts with either
method to dilate strictures.
• Insertion of a prosthesis which is a rigid or flexible tube
designed to keep a narrowed area open; it is usuallyplaced after a stricture is dilated with a balloon.
• Removal of stones can be accomplished most often by
endoscopic techniques. A number of methods havebeen developed to perform this including laser and con-tact lithotripsy in which stones are fragmented by
high-energy waves.
Surgical treatment
Fortunately, with recent advances in the above meth-
ods, this is a last option. Nonetheless, about 5–10% ofpatients will need to undergo surgical exploration of thebile ducts.
In some instances, the bile duct is so narrowed due to
prior inflammation or tumor, that it needs connection to adifferent area of the intestinal tract to drain. This is rathercomplicated surgery and carries a mortality rate of 2%.

gallbladder and bile ducts. It is often combined withendoscopic procedures to ease the passage of fragmentedstones, or oral medications that can dissolve the frag-ments. Rarely, stones are also dissolved by instilling vari-ous chemicals such as ether directly into the bile ducts.
Prognosis
The outlook for those with cholangitis has markedly
improved in the last several years due in large part to thedevelopment of the techniques described above. For those
patients whose episode of infection is caused by some-thing other than a simple stone, the future is not as bright,but still often responsive to treatment. Some patients withautoimmune disease will need liver transplantation .

"Prevention
This involves eliminating those factors that increase
the risk of infection of the bile ducts, mainly stones andstrictures. If it is medically possible, patients who havetheir gallbladder and suffer a bout of cholangitis shouldundergo surgical removal of the gallbladder and removalof any stones.
For other patients, a variety of therapies as outlined
above, including dissolving small stones with bile acids,are also available. A combination of several of thesemethods is needed in some patients. Patients should dis-cuss the risks and alternatives of these treatments withtheir physicians.

Cholecystectomy
Definition
A cholecystectomy is the surgical removal of the
gallbladder. The two basic types of this procedure areopen cholecystectomy and the laparoscopic approach. Itis estimated that the laparoscopic procedure is currentlyused for approximately 80% of cases.

"Purpose
A cholecystectomy is performed to treat cholelithia-
sis and cholecystitis . In cholelithiasis, gallstones of
varying shapes and sizes form from the solid componentsof bile. The presence of stones, often referred to as gall-bladder disease, may produce symptoms of excruciatingright upper abdominal pain radiating to the right shoul-
der. The gallbladder may become the site of acute infec-tion and inflammation, resulting in symptoms of upperright abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting . This condi-
tion is referred to as cholecystitis. The surgical removalof the gallbladder can provide relief of these symptoms.
Precautions
Although the laparoscopic procedure requires general
anesthesia for about the same length of time as the openprocedure, laparoscopy generally produces less postoper-"
"ative pain, and a shorter recovery period. The laparoscopicprocedure would not be preferred in cases where the gall-bladder is so inflamed that it could rupture, or when adhe-sions (additional fibrous bands of tissue) are present.
Description
The laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves the inser-
tion of a long narrow cylindrical tube with a camera onthe end, through an approximately 1 cm incision in theabdomen, which allows visualization of the internalorgans and projection of this image onto a video monitor.Three smaller incisions allow for insertion of other instru-ments to perform the surgical procedure. A laser may beused for the incision and cautery (burning unwanted tis-sue to stop bleeding), in which case the procedure may becalled laser laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

"In a conventional or open cholecystectomy, the gall-
bladder is removed through a surgical incision high in theright abdomen, just beneath the ribs. A drain may be insert-ed to prevent accumulation of fluid at the surgical site.
Preparation
As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be
required to sign a consent form after the procedure isexplained thoroughly. Food and fluids will be prohibitedafter midnight before the procedure. Enemas may be
ordered to clean out the bowel. If nausea or vomiting arepresent, a suction tube to empty the stomach may beused, and for laparoscopic procedures, a urinary drainagecatheter will also be used to decrease the risk of acciden-tal puncture of the stomach or bladder with insertion ofthe trocar (a sharp-pointed instrument).

"Aftercare
Post-operative care for the patient who has had an open
cholecystectomy, as with those who have had any majorsurgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respi-ration and temperature. Breathing tends to be shallowbecause of the effect of anesthesia, and the patient’s reluc-tance to breathe deeply due to the pain caused by the prox-imity of the incision to the muscles used for respiration. Thepatient is shown how to support the operative site whenbreathing deeply and coughing, and given pain medicationas necessary. Fluid intake and output is measured, and the

"Care received immediately after laparoscopic cholecys-
tectomy is similar to that of any patient undergoing surgerywith general anesthesia. A unique post-operative pain maybe experienced in the right shoulder related to pressure fromcarbon dioxide used through the laparoscopic tubes. Thispain may be relieved by laying on the left side with rightknee and thigh drawn up to the chest. Walking will also helpincrease the body’s reabsorption of the gas. The patient isusually discharged the day after surgery, and allowed toshower on the second postoperative day. The patient isadvised to gradually resume normal activities over a threeday period, while avoiding heavy lifting for about 10 days.
Risks
Potential problems associated with open cholecys-
tectomy include respiratory problems related to locationof the incision, wound infection, or abscess formation."
"Possible complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomyinclude accidental puncture of the bowel or bladder anduncontrolled bleeding. Incomplete reabsorption of thecarbon dioxide gas could irritate the muscles used in res-piration and cause respiratory distress.

Cholecystitis
Definition
Cholecystitis refers to a painful inflammation of the
gallbladder’s wall. The disorder can occur a single time(acute), or can recur multiple times (chronic).

"Description
The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ in the
upper right hand corner of the abdomen. It is connectedby a series of ducts (tube-like channels) to the liver, pan-creas, and duodenum (first part of the small intestine). Toaid in digestion, the liver produces a substance calledbile, which is passed into the gallbladder. The gallblad-der concentrates this bile, meaning that it reabsorbs someof the fluid from the bile to make it more potent. After ameal, bile is squeezed out of the gallbladder by strongmuscular contractions, and passes through a duct into theduodenum. Due to the chemical makeup of bile, the con-tents of the duodenum are kept at an optimal pH level fordigestion. The bile also plays an important part in allow-ing fats within the small intestine to be absorbed.
Causes and symptoms

"bladder contains gallstones . Gallstones are solid accu-
mulations of the components of bile, particularly choles-terol, bile pigments, and calcium. These solids mayoccur when the components of bile are not in the correctproportion to each other. If the bile becomes overly con-centrated, or if too much of one component is present,stones may form. When these stones block the duct leav-ing the gallbladder, bile accumulates within the gallblad-der. The gallbladder continues to contract, but the bile

"cannot pass out of the gallbladder in the normal way.
Back pressure on the gallbladder, chemical changes fromthe stagnating bile trapped within the gallbladder, andoccasionally bacterial infection, result in damage to thegallbladder wall. As the gallbladder becomes swollen,some areas of the wall do not receive adequate bloodflow, and lack of oxygen causes cells to die.
When the stone blocks the flow of bile from the liver,
certain normal byproducts of the liver’s processing of redblood cells (called bilirubin) build up. The bilirubin isreabsorbed into the bloodstream, and over time this biliru-bin is deposited in the skin and in the whites of the eyes.Because bilirubin contains a yellowish color, it causes ayellowish cast to the skin and eyes that is called jaundice .
Gallstone formation is seen in twice as many women"
"Gallstone formation is seen in twice as many women
as men, particularly those between the ages of 20 and 60.Pregnant women, or those on birth control pills or estro-gen replacement therapy have a greater risk of gallstones,as do Native Americans and Mexican Americans. Peoplewho are overweight, or who lose a large amount ofweight quickly are also at greater risk for developinggallstones. Not all individuals with gallstones will go onto have cholecystitis, since many people never have anysymptoms from their gallstones and never know theyexist. However, the vast majority of people with chole-cystitis will be found to have gallstones. Rare causes ofcholecystitis include severe burns or injury, massive sys-
temic infection, severe illness, diabetes, obstruction by atumor of the duct leaving the gallbladder, and certainuncommon infections of the gallbladder (including bac-teria and worms).
Although there are rare reports of patients with
chronic cholecystitis who never experience any pain ,"
"chronic cholecystitis who never experience any pain ,
nearly 100% of the time cholecystitis will be diagnosedafter a patient has experienced a bout of severe pain inthe region of the gallbladder and liver. The pain may becrampy and episodic, or it may be constant. The pain isoften described as pushing through to the right upperback and shoulder. Because deep breathing increases thepain, breathing becomes shallow. Fever is often present,
and nausea and vomiting are nearly universal. Jaundice
occurs when the duct leaving the liver is also obstructed,although it may take a number of days for it to becomeapparent. When bacterial infection sets in, the patientmay begin to experience higher fever and shaking chills.

"Diagnosis
Diagnosis of cholecystitis involves a careful abdomi-
nal examination. The enlarged, tender gallbladder may befelt through the abdominal wall. Pressure in the upperright corner of the abdomen may cause the patient to stopbreathing in, due to an increase in pain. This is calledMurphy’s sign. Physical examination may also reveal an
increased heart rate and an increased rate of breathing.
Blood tests will show an increase in the white blood
count , as well as an increase in bilirubin. Ultrasound is
used to look for gallstones and to measure the thicknessof the gallbladder wall (a marker of inflammation andscarring). A scan of the liver and gallbladder, with carefulattention to the system of ducts throughout (called the bil-iary tree) is also used to demonstrate obstruction of ducts.
Rare complications of cholecystitis include:
• massive infection of the gallbladder, in which the gall-
bladder becomes filled with pus (called empyema )"
"bladder becomes filled with pus (called empyema )
• perforation of the gallbladder, in which the build-up of
material within the gallbladder becomes so great thatthe wall of the organ bursts, with a resulting abdominalinfection called peritonitis
• formation of abnormal connections between the gall-
bladder and other organs (the duodenum, large intes-tine, stomach), called fistulas
• obstruction of the intestine by a very large gallstone
(called gallstone ileus )
• emphysema of the gallbladder, in which certain bacte-
ria that produce gas infect the gallbladder, resulting instretching of the gallbladder and disruption of its wallby gas
Treatment
Initial treatment of cholecystitis usually requires
hospitalization. The patient is given fluids, salts, and sug-ars through a needle placed in a vein (intravenous or IV).No food or drink is given by mouth, and often a tube,called a nasogastric or NG tube, will need to be passedthrough the nose and down into the stomach to drain out"

"the excess fluids. If infection is suspected, antibiotics
are given.
Ultimately, treatment almost always involves removal
of the gallbladder, a surgery called cholecystectomy .
While this is not usually recommended while the patient isacutely ill, patients with complications usually do requireemergency surgery (immediately following diagnosis)because the death rate increases in these cases. Similarly,"
"those patients who have cholecystitis with no gallstoneshave about a 50% chance of death if the gallbladder is notquickly removed. Most patients, however, do best ifsurgery is performed after they have been stabilized withfluids, an NG tube, and antibiotics as necessary. Whenthis is possible, gallbladder removal is done within five tosix days of diagnosis. In patients who have other seriousmedical problems that may increase the risks of gallblad-der removal surgery, the surgeon may decide to leave thegallbladder in place. In this case, the operation mayinvolve removing obstructing gallstones and draininginfected bile (called cholecystotomy).
Both cholecystectomy and cholecystotomy may be
performed via the classical open abdominal operation(laparotomy). Tiny, “keyhole” incisions, a flexible scope,and a laser device that shatters the stones (a laparoscopicKEY TERMS

"scopic procedure can also be used to remove the gallblad-der through one of the small incisions. Because of thesmaller incisions, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a pro-cedure that is less painful and promotes faster healing.
Prognosis
Hospital management of cholecystitis ends the symp-
toms for about 75% of all patients. Of these patients,however, 25% will go on to have another attack of chole-cystitis within a year, and 60% will have another attackwithin six years. Each attack of cholecystitis increases apatient’s risk of developing life-threatening complica-tions, requiring risky emergency surgery. Therefore, earlyremoval of the gallbladder, rather than a “wait-and-see”approach, is usually recommended. Cure is complete inthose patients who undergo cholecystectomy.
Prevention
Prevention of cholecystitis is probably best attempt-
ed by maintaining a reasonably ideal weight. Some stud-ies have suggested that eating a diet high in fiber, vegeta-bles, and fruit is also protective."

Cholera
Definition
Cholera is an acute illness characterized by watery
diarrhea that is caused by the bacterium Vibrio
cholerae . Cholera is spread by eating food or drinking
water contaminated with the bacteria. Although cholerawas a public health problem in the United States andEurope a hundred years ago, modern sanitation and thetreatment of drinking water have virtually eliminated thedisease in developed countries. In third world countries,however, cholera is still common.
Description

"Description
Cholera is spread by eating food or drinking water
that has been contaminated with cholera bacteria. Conta-mination usually occurs when human feces from a per-son who has the disease seeps into a community watersupply. Fruits and vegetables can also be contaminated inareas where crops are fertilized with human feces.Cholera bacteria also live in warm, brackish water andcan infect persons who eat raw or undercooked seafoodobtained from such waters. Cholera is rarely transmitteddirectly from one person to another.
Cholera often occurs in outbreaks or epidemics. The
World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that duringany cholera epidemic, approximately 0.2–1% of the localpopulation will contract the disease. Anyone can getcholera, but infants, children, and the elderly are morelikely to die from the disease because they become dehy-drated faster than adults. There is no particular season inwhich cholera is more likely to occur."
"Because of an extensive system of sewage and water
treatment in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan,and Australia, cholera is generally not a concern for visi-tors and residents of these countries. People visiting orliving in other parts of the world, particularly on the Indi-an subcontinent and in parts of Africa and South Ameri-ca, should be aware of the potential for contractingcholera and practice prevention. Fortunately, the diseaseis both preventable and treatable.
Causes and symptoms
Because V . cholerae bacteria are sensitive to acid,
most cholera-causing bacteria die in the acidic environ-ment of the stomach. However, when a person has ingest-ed food or water containing large amounts of cholera bac-teria, some will survive to infect the intestines. As wouldbe expected, antacid usage or the use of any medicationthat blocks acid production in the stomach would allowmore bacteria to survive and cause infection.
In the small intestine, the rapidly multiplying bacte-"
"In the small intestine, the rapidly multiplying bacte-
ria produce a toxin that causes a large volume of waterand electrolytes to be secreted into the bowels and thento be abruptly eliminated as watery diarrhea. V omitingmay also occur. Symptoms begin to appear between oneand three days after the contaminated food or water hasbeen ingested.
Most cases of cholera are mild, but about one in 20
patients experience severe, potentially life-threateningsymptoms. In severe cases, fluids can be lost throughdiarrhea and vomiting at the rate of one quart per hour.This can produce a dangerous state of dehydration
unless the lost fluids and electrolytes are rapidly replaced.

• Cook it. Eat only thoroughly cooked foods, and eat
them while they are still hot. Avoid eating food fromstreet vendors.
• Peel it. Eat only fruit or nuts with a thick, intact skin or
shell that is removed immediately before eating.
• Forget it. Do not eat raw foods such as oysters or

Cholestasis
Definition
Cholestasis is a condition caused by rapidly devel-
oping (acute) or long-term (chronic) interruption in theexcretion of bile (a digestive fluid that helps the bodyprocess fat). The term is taken from the Greek chole ,
bile, and stasis , standing still.
Description
Cholestasis is caused by obstruction within the liver
(intrahepatic) or outside the liver (extrahepatic). Theobstruction causes bile salts, the bile pigment bilirubin,and fats (lipids) to accumulate in the blood streaminstead of being eliminated normally.

"Intrahepatic cholestasis is characterized by wide-
spread blockage of small ducts or by disorders, such ashepatitis, that impair the body’s ability to eliminate bile.Extrahepatic cholestasis can occur as a side effect ofmany medications. It can also occur as a complication ofsurgery, serious injury, tissue-destroying infection, orintravenous feeding. Extrahepatic cholestasis can becaused by conditions such as tumors and gallstones that
block the flow of bile from the gallbladder to the firstpart of the small intestine (duodenum).
Pregnancy increases the sensitivity of the bile ducts
to estrogen, and cholestasis often develops during the sec-ond and third trimesters of pregnancy. This condition isthe second most common cause of jaundice during preg-

"nancy, but generalized itching (pruritus gravidarum) is
the only symptom most women experience. Cholestasisof pregnancy tends to run in families. Symptoms usuallydisappear within two to four weeks after the baby’s birthbut may reappear if the woman becomes pregnant again.
A similar condition affects some women who take
birth-control pills. Symptoms disappear after the womanstops using oral contraceptives . This condition does not
lead to chronic liver disease. A woman who developscholestasis from either of these causes (pregnancy orbirth control hormones) has an increased risk of develop-ing cholestasis from the other.
Benign familial recurrent cholestasis is a rare condi-
tion characterized by brief, repeated episodes of itchingand jaundice. Symptoms often disappear. This conditiondoes not cause cirrhosis .

of drug-induced cholestasis are direct toxic injury andreactions unique to an individual (idiosyncratic reactions).In direct toxic injury, the severity of symptoms parallelsthe amount of medication involved. This condition:
• develops a short time after treatment begins• follows a predictable pattern
• usually causes liver damage
Direct toxic reactions develop in 1% of all patients
who take chlorpromazine (Thorazine), a tranquilizer andantinausea drug. Idiosyncratic reactions may occur at theonset of treatment or at a later time. Allergic responsesare varied and are not related to the amount of medica-tion being taken.

In rare cases, a condition resembling chronicbiliary cirrhosis (a progressive disease characterized bydestruction of small bile ducts) persists even after themedication is stopped. Some patients experience a simi-lar reaction in response to tricyclic antidepressants(amitriptyline, imipramine), phenylbutazone (Butazo-lidin), erythromycin estolate (Estomycin, Purmycin), andother drugs. Intrahepatic cholestasis may also be causedby alcoholic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis ,
cancer that has spread (metastasized) from another part
of the body, and a number of rare disorders.

"Extrahepatic cholestasis is most often caused by a stone

"Symptoms of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic
cholestasis include a yellow discoloration of the skin(jaundice), dark urine, and pale stools. Itching over theskin may be severe if the condition is advanced.
Symptoms of chronic cholestasis include:

• scars or skin injuries caused by scratching• bone pain
• yellowish fat deposits beneath the surface of the skin
(xanthoma) or around the eyes (xanthelasma)
Patients with advanced cholestasis feel ill, tire easi-
ly, and are often nauseated. Abdominal pain and suchsystemic symptoms as anorexia, vomiting, and fever areusually due to the underlying condition that causescholestasis.

drugs, and symptoms like ascites (abnormal abdominal
swelling) and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) suggestintrahepatic cholestasis. Pain or rigidity in the gallblad-der or pancreas suggest an extrahepatic form.
Blood tests and liver function tests can reveal the
pattern and extent of liver injury, indicate functionalabnormalities, and establish the cause of the condition.However, most misdiagnoses occur when physicians relymore on laboratory analysis than on detailed medical his-tory and the results of a thorough physical examination ."
"Special attention should be paid to three liver functiontests. Levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanineaminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase(AST) can indicate whether the patient’s condition iscaused by an obstructive condition like cholestasis or adisease of the liver cells (hepatocellular disease) likeviral hepatitis or cancer. ALP levels more than threetimes greater than normal indicate cholestasis. High lev-els of AST and particularly of ALT, which is found pre-dominantly in liver cells, indicate hepatocellular disease.

more detailed information about the source of theobstruction. If these procedures that do not enter thepatient’s body (non-invasive procedures) do not providethe information a family physician, internist, or gastroen-terologist needs to make a diagnosis of cholestasis, oneof these procedures may be performed:
• direct cholangiography, an x-ray map of the bile ducts,
enhanced by the use of contrast dye
• percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, used to
identify obstructions that impede the flow of bile fromthe liver to the digestive system, takes x-ray images ofthe bile ducts after a contrast dye has been injected by aneedle passed directly into a hepatic duct
• endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP), which uses a special dye to outline the pancre-atic and common bile ducts and highlight the positionof any obstruction; a special tube with a light transmit-ter is inserted into the duct and a series of x-ray imagesis taken"
"A doctor who thinks a physical obstruction is
responsible for progressive deterioration of a patient’scondition may consider an exploratory surgical proce-dure (diagnostic laparotomy). Liver biopsy is sometimes
performed if imaging tests do not indicate why a duct isenlarged, but results of a single biopsy may not representthe status of the entire organ.Treatment
The goal of treatment is to eliminate or control the
patient’s symptoms. Discontinuing the use of certaindrugs can restore normal liver function, but surgery maybe needed to drain or remove obstructions or to widenaffected ducts.
Rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane), an antibacterial
drug; phenobarbital, a barbiturate anticonvulsant; andother drugs are sometimes prescribed to cleanse the sys-tem and eliminate bile salts and other toxic compounds.

ble digesting fat may have to restrict the amount of fat intheir diet and take calcium and water-soluble vitaminsupplements. A liver transplant may become necessary ifcomplications occur.
Prognosis
Symptoms almost always disappear after the under-
lying condition is controlled.
Some patients who have cholestasis experience symp-
toms only after infection develops, but chronic bile-ductobstruction always leads to cirrhosis. It may also causeosteoporosis (fragile bones) or osteomalacia (soft bones).
Emergency care is not required unless inflammation
of the bile ducts ( cholangitis ) develops. Cancer should
be considered when an adult suddenly develops cholesta-sis after the age of 50.

"Cholesterol, high
Definition
Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in animal tis-
sue and is an important component to the human body. Itis manufactured in the liver and carried throughout thebody in the bloodstream. Problems can occur when toomuch cholesterol forms an accumulation of plaque onblood vessel walls, which impedes blood flow to theheart and other organs. The highest cholesterol content isfound in meat, poultry, shellfish, and dairy products.
Description
Cholesterol is the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of medi-
cine, since it has both a good side and bad side. It is nec-essary to digest fats from food, make hormones, build cellwalls, and participate in other processes for maintaining ahealthy body. When people talk about cholesterol as amedical problem, they are usually referring to high cho-lesterol. This can be somewhat misleading, since there arefour components to cholesterol. These are:
• LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol
• HDL, the so-called good cholesterol"
"• LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol
• HDL, the so-called good cholesterol
• triglycerides, a blood fat lipid that increases the risk for
heart disease
• total cholesterol
High LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is a major con-
tributing factor of heart disease. The cholesterol formsplaque in the heart’s blood vessels, which restricts orblocks the supply of blood to the heart, and causes acondition called atherosclerosis . This can lead to a
“heart attack,” resulting in damage to the heart and pos-sibly death . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) estimates that 90 million American adults,roughly half the adult population, have elevated choles-terol levels.
The population as a whole is at some risk of devel-
oping high LDL cholesterol in their lifetimes. Specificrisk factors include a family history of high choles-terol, obesity ,heart attack or stroke ,alcoholism , and

"lack of regular exercise . The chances of developing
high cholesterol increase after the age of 45. One of theprimary causes of high LDL cholesterol is too much fator sugar in the diet, a problem especially true in theUnited States. Cholesterol is also produced naturally inthe liver and overproduction may occur even in peoplewho limit their intake of high cholesterol food. LowHDL and high triglyceride levels are also risk factorsfor atherosclerosis.Causes and symptoms
There are no readily apparent symptoms that indi-
cate high LDL or triglycerides, or low HDL. The onlyway to diagnose the problems is through a simple bloodtest. However, one general indication of high cholesterolis obesity. Another is a high-fat diet.
Diagnosis
High cholesterol is often diagnosed and treated by"
"general practitioners or family practice physicians. Insome cases, the condition is treated by an endocrinolo-gist or cardiologist. Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, andtriglyceride levels as well as the cholesterol to HDL ratioare measured by a blood test called a lipid panel. Thecost of a lipid panel is generally $40–100 and is coveredby most health insurance and HMO plans, includingMedicare, providing there is an appropriate reason forthe test. Home cholesterol testing kits are available overthe counter but test only for total cholesterol. The resultsshould only be used as a guide and if the total cholesterollevel is high or low, a lipid panel should be performed bya physician. In most adults the recommended levels,measured by milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) of blood,are: total cholesterol, less than 200; LDL, less than 130;HDL, more than 35; triglycerides, 30–200; and choles-terol to HDL ratio, four to one.

be due to the size of the cholesterol particles in thebloodstream. A test called a nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) LipoProfile exposes a blood sample to a magnet-ic field to determine the size of the cholesterol particles.Particle size can also be determined by a centrifugationtest, where blood samples are spun very quickly to allowparticles to separate and move at different distances. Thesmaller the particles, the greater the chance of develop-ing heart disease. It allows physicians to treat patientswho have normal or close to normal results from a lipidpanel but abnormal particle size.

able to treat cholesterol problems. These include statinssuch as Mevacor (lovastatin), Lescol (fluvastatin), Prava-chol (pravastatin), Zocor (simvastatin), Baycol (cervas-tatin), and Lipitor (atorvastatin) to lower LDL. A groupof drugs called fibric acid derivatives are used to lowertriglycerides and raise HDL. These include Lopid (gem-fibrozil), Atromid-S (clofibrate), and Tricor (fenofibrate).Doctors decide which drug to use based on the severityof the cholesterol problem, side effects, and cost.

"Alternative treatment
The primary goal of cholesterol treatment is to lower
LDL to under 160 mg/dL in people without heart diseaseand who are at lower risk of developing it. The goal inpeople with higher risk factors for heart disease is less than130 mg/dL. In patients who already have heart disease, thegoal is under 100 mg/dL, according to FDA guidelines.Also, since low HDL levels increase the risks of heart dis-ease, the goal of all patients is more than 35 mg/dL.
In both alternative and conventional treatment of

Cholestin hit the over-the-counter market in 1997 as
a cholesterol-lowering dietary supplement. It is aprocessed form of red yeast fermented with rice, a tradi-tional herbal remedy used for centuries by the Chinese.Two studies released in 1998 showed Cholestin loweredLDL cholesterol by 20–30%. It also appeared to raiseHDL and lower triglyceride levels. Although the supple-ment contains hundreds of compounds, the major activeLDL-lowering ingredient is lovastatin, a chemical alsofound in the prescription drug Mevacor. The FDA bannedCholestin in early 1998 but a federal district court judgelifted the ban a year later, ruling the product was a dietarysupplement, not a drug. It is not fully understood how thesubstance works and patients may want to consult withtheir physician before taking Cholestin. No serious sideeffects have been reported, but minor side effects, includ-ing bloating and heartburn , have been reported.

"Other treatments
A study released in 1999 indicated that blue-green
algae contains polyunsaturated fatty acids that lowercholesterol. The algae, known as alga Aphanizomenon
flos-aquae (AFA) is available as an over-the-counter
dietary supplement. Niacin, also known as nicotinic acidor vitamin B
3, has been shown to reduce LDL levels by
10–20%, and raise HDL levels by 15–35%. It also canreduce triglycerides. But because an extremely high doseof niacin (2–3 g) is needed to treat cholesterol problems,it should only be taken under a doctor’s supervision tomonitor possible toxic side effects. Niacin can also causeflushing when taken in high doses. Soy protein with highlevels of isoflavones also have been shown to reduce badcholesterol by up to 10%. A daily diet that contains 62mg of isoflavones in soy protein is recommended, andcan be incorporated into other diet regimens, includingvegetarian, Asian, and low glycemic.

High cholesterol is one of the key risk factors for

(angina ), blood clots, and heart attacks. Heart disease is
the number one killer of men and women in the UnitedStates. By reducing LDL, people with heart disease mayprevent further heart attacks and strokes, prolong andimprove the quality of their lives, and slow or reversecholesterol build-up in the arteries. In people withoutheart disease, lowering LDL can decrease the risk of afirst heart attack or stroke.

"Prevention
The best way to prevent cholesterol problems is
through a combination of healthy lifestyle activities, aprimarily low-fat and high-fiber diet, regular aerobicexercise, not smoking, and maintaining an optimalweight. But for people with high risk factors for heartdisease, such as a family history of heart disease, dia-betes, and being over the age of 45, these measuresmay not be enough to prevent the onset of high choles-terol. There are studies being done on the effective-ness of some existing anti-cholesterol drugs for con-trolling cholesterol levels in patients who do not meetthe criteria for high cholesterol but no definitiveresults are available.

"Cholesterol-reducing drugs
Definition
Cholesterol-reducing drugs are medicines that lower
the amount of cholesterol (a fat-like substance) in theblood.
Purpose
Cholesterol is a chemical that can both benefit and
harm the body. On the good side, cholesterol plays impor-tant roles in the structure of cells and in the production ofhormones. But too much cholesterol in the blood can leadto heart and blood vessel disease. To complicate matters,not all cholesterol contributes to heart and blood vesselproblems. One type, called high-density lipoprotein(HDL) cholesterol, or “good cholesterol,” actually lowersthe risk of these problems. The other type, low-densitylipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or “bad cholesterol,” is thetype that threatens people’s health. The names reflect theway cholesterol moves through the body. To travelthrough the bloodstream, cholesterol must attach itself toa protein. The combination of a protein and a fatty sub-stance like cholesterol is called a lipoprotein."
"Many factors may contribute to the fact that some
people have higher cholesterol levels than others. A diethigh in certain types of fats is one factor. Medical prob-lems such as poorly controlled diabetes, an underactivethyroid gland, an overactive pituitary gland, liver diseaseor kidney failure also may cause high cholesterol levels.
And some people have inherited disorders that preventtheir bodies from properly using and eliminating fats.This allows cholesterol to build up in the blood.
Treatment for high cholesterol levels usually begins
with changes in daily habits. By losing weight, stoppingsmoking , exercising more and reducing the amount of
fat and cholesterol in the diet, many people can bringtheir cholesterol levels down to acceptable levels. How-ever, some may need to use cholesterol-reducing drugs toreduce their risk of health problems.
Description
There are four different classes of cholesterol lower-
ing drugs:
Bile acid sequesterants are drugs that act by binding"
"ing drugs:
Bile acid sequesterants are drugs that act by binding
with the bile produced by the liver. Bile helps the diges-tion and absorption of fats in the intestine. By blockingthe digestion of fats, bile acid sequesterants prevent theformation of cholesterol. Drugs in this class include:cholestyramine (Questran); colestipol (Colestid); andcolesevalam (Welchol).HMG-CoA inhibitors, often called “statins,” are
drugs that block an enzyme called “3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase.” This blocks one of thesteps in converting fat to cholesterol. These are the mosteffective cholesterol lowering agents available. Drugs inthis group include: atorvastatin (Lipitor); cerivastatin(Baycol); fluvastatin (Lescol); lovastatin (Mevacor);pravastatin (Pravachol); and simvastatin (Zocor).
Fibric acid derivatives include clofibrate (Atromid-"
"Fibric acid derivatives include clofibrate (Atromid-
S); gemfibrozil (Lopid); and fenofibrate (Tricor).Although these drugs are less effective than the statins atlowering total cholesterol, they may be able to lower thelow-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol while raisingthe high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Theirexact mechanism of action is believed to be associatedwith inhibition of lipoprotein lipase activity.
Niacin, vitamin B-3, is also effective in lowering
cholesterol levels. Although the normal vitamin dose ofniacin is only 20 mg, the dose required to reduce choles-terol levels is at least 500 mg each day. The mechanismof action of niacin in cholesterol reduction is associatedwith the inhibition of VLDL secretion in the blood-stream.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
cholesterol-reducing drug used. The prescribing physi-cian or the pharmacist who filled the prescription canadvise about the correct dosage."
"Cholesterol-reducing drugs should be taken exactly
as directed and doses should not be missed. Doubledoses should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.
Physicians may prescribe a combination of choles-
terol-reducing drugs, such as pravastatin and colestipol.Following the directions for how and when to take thedrugs is very important. The medicine may not workproperly if both drugs are taken at the same time of day.
Niacin should not be taken at the same time as an
HMG-CoA inhibitor, as this combination may causesevere muscle problems. If niacin is taken in an over-the-counter form, both the prescribing physician and phar-macist should be informed. There are no problems whenthe niacin is taken in normal doses as a vitamin.
The prescription should not be stopped without first
checking with the physician who prescribed it. Choles-terol levels may increase when the medicine is stopped,and the physician may prescribe a special diet to makethis less likely.
Precautions"
"Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking cholesterol-
reducing drugs is important. The physician will check to

"make sure the medicine is working as it should and will
decide whether it is still needed. Blood tests and othermedical tests may be ordered to help the physician moni-tor the drug’s effectiveness and check for side effects.
For most people, cholesterol-reducing drugs are just
one part of a whole program for lowering cholesterol lev-els. Other important elements of the program mayinclude weight loss, exercise , special diets and changes
in other habits. The medication should never be viewedas a substitute for other measures ordered by the physi-cian. Cholesterol-reducing drugs will not cure problemsthat cause high cholesterol; they will only help controlcholesterol levels.
People over 60 years of age may be unusually sensi-
tive to the effects of some cholesterol-reducing drugs.This may increase the chance of side effects.
Anyone who is taking an HMG-CoA reductase"
"Anyone who is taking an HMG-CoA reductase
inhibitor should notify the health care professional incharge before having any surgical or dental procedures orreceiving emergency treatment.
Special conditions
People who have certain medical conditions or who
are taking certain other medications may have problemsif they take cholesterol-reducing drugs. Before takingthese drugs, the prescribing physician should beinformed of any of the following conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to cholesterol-reducing drugs in the past should informthe prescribing physician before taking the drugs again.The physician should also be told about any allergies to
foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.

shown that giving high doses of gemfibrozil duringpregnancy increases the risk of birth defects and other
problems, including death of the unborn baby. The"
"problems, including death of the unborn baby. The
effects of this drug have not been studied in pregnantwomen. Women who are pregnant or who may becomepregnant should check with their physicians beforeusing gemfibrozil.
Cholesterol-reducing drugs in the group known as
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (such as lovastatin, flu-vastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin) should not be takenby women who are pregnant or who plan to becomepregnant soon. By blocking the production of choles-terol, these drugs prevent a fetus from developing proper-ly. Women who are able to bear children should use aneffective birth control method while taking these drugs.Any woman who becomes pregnant while taking thesedrugs should check with her physician immediately.Cholestyramine and colestipol will not directly harm
an unborn baby, because these drugs are not taken intothe body. However, the drugs may keep the mother’sbody from absorbing vitamins that she and the baby"
"need. Pregnant women who take these drugs should asktheir physicians whether they need to take extra vitamins.
BREASTFEEDING. Because cholestyramine and cole-
stipol interfere with the absorption of vitamins, womenwho use these drugs while breastfeeding should ask theirphysicians if they need to take extra vitamins.
Women who are breastfeeding should talk to their
physicians before using gemfibrozil. Whether this drugpasses into breast milk is not known. But because animalstudies suggest that it may increase the risk of sometypes of cancer , women should carefully consider the
safety of using it while breastfeeding.
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (such as lovastatin,
pravastatin, fluvastatin and simvastatin) should not beused by women who are breastfeeding their babies.

• bleeding problems
• underactive thyroid
• heart or blood vessel disease
In addition, people with kidney or liver disease may
be more likely to have blood problems or other sideeffects when they take certain cholesterol-reducingdrugs. And some drugs of this type may actually raisecholesterol levels in people with liver disease.

"Cholesterol test
Definition
The cholesterol test is a quantitative analysis of the
cholesterol levels in a sample of the patient’s blood. Totalserum cholesterol (TC) is the measurement routinely taken.Doctors sometimes order a complete lipoprotein profile tobetter evaluate the risk for atherosclerosis (coronary
artery disease , or CAD). The full lipoprotein profile also
includes measurements of triglyceride levels (a chemicalcompound that forms 95% of the fats and oils stored in ani-mal or vegetable cells) and lipoproteins (high density andlow density). Blood fats are also called “lipids.”

"The type of cholesterol in the blood is as important as
the total quantity. Cholesterol is a fatty substance and can-not be dissolved in water. It must combine with a proteinmolecule called a lipoprotein in order to be transported inthe blood. There are five major types of lipoproteins in thehuman body; they differ in the amount of cholesterol thatthey carry in comparison to other fats and fatty acids, andin their functions in the body. Lipoproteins are classified,as follows, according to their density:
• Chylomicrons. These are normally found in the blood
only after a person has eaten foods containing fats.They contain about 7% cholesterol. Chylomicronstransport fats and cholesterol from the intestine into theliver and then into the bloodstream. They are metabo-lized in the process of carrying food energy to muscleand fat cells.

"• Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). These lipopro-
teins carry mostly triglycerides, but they also contain16–22% cholesterol. VLDLs are made in the liver andeventually become IDL particles after they have losttheir triglyceride content.
• Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL). IDLs are
short-lived lipoproteins containing about 30% choles-terol that are converted in the liver to low-densitylipoproteins (LDLs).
• Low-density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL molecules carry
cholesterol from the liver to other body tissues. Theycontain about 50% cholesterol. Extra LDLs are absorbedby the liver and their cholesterol is excreted into the bile.LDL particles are involved in the formation of plaques(abnormal deposits of cholesterol) in the walls of thecoronary arteries. LDL is known as “bad cholesterol.”

"• High-density lipoproteins (HDL). HDL molecules are
made in the intestines and the liver. HDLs are about50% protein and 19% cholesterol. They help to removecholesterol from artery walls. Lifestyle changes,including exercising, keeping weight within recom-mended limits, and giving up smoking can increase the
body’s levels of HDL cholesterol. HDL is known as“good cholesterol.”
Because of the difference in density and cholesterol
content of lipoproteins, two patients with the same totalcholesterol level can have very different lipid profilesand different risk for CAD. The critical factor is the levelof HDL cholesterol in the blood serum. Some doctorsuse the ratio of the total cholesterol level to HDL choles-terol when assessing the patient’s degree of risk. A lowTC/HDL ratio is associated with a lower degree of risk.

"Description
The cholesterol test requires a sample of the
patient’s blood. Fasting before the test is required to get
an accurate triglyceride and LDL level. The blood iswithdrawn by the usual vacuum tube technique from oneof the patient’s veins. The blood test takes between threeand five minutes.
Preparation
Patients who are scheduled for a lipid profile test
should fast (except for water) for 12–14 hours before theblood sample is drawn. If the patient’s cholesterol is tobe fractionated, he or she should also avoid alcohol for24 hours before the test.
Patients should also stop taking any medications that
may affect the accuracy of the test results. These includecorticosteroids , estrogen or androgens, oral contracep-
tives , some diuretics , haloperidol, some antibiotics , and"

than “normal” cholesterol values, on the grounds that“normal” refers to statistically average levels that maystill be too high for good health. Desirable values are asfollows:

Cholinergic drugs
Definition
Cholinergic drugs are medications that produce the
same effects as the parasympathetic nervous system.Purpose
Cholinergic drugs produce the same effects as acetyl-
choline. Acetylcholine is the most common neurohor-mone of the parasympathetic nervous system, the part ofthe peripheral nervous system responsible for the everyday work of the body. While the sympathetic nervous sys-tem acts during times of excitation, the parasympatheticsystem deals with everyday activities such as salivation,digestion, and muscle relaxation.
The cholinergic drugs may be used in several ways."
"The cholinergic drugs may be used in several ways.
The cholinergic muscle stimulants are used to diagnose andtreat myathenia gravis, a disease that causes severe muscleweakness. This class of drugs includes ambenonium chlo-ride (Mytelase), edrophonium chloride (Tensilon), neostig-mine (Prostigmine), and piridogstimina (Mestinón). Thesedrugs are also widely used in surgery, both to reduce therisk of urinary retention, and to reverse the effects of themuscle relaxant drugs that are used in surgery.
Cholinergic drugs are also used in control of glauco-
ma, a disease that is caused by increased pressure inside
the eye. The most common drugs used for this purposeare demecarium (Humorsol) and echthiophate (Phospho-line iodide).
Description
Cholinergic drugs usually act in one of two ways."
"Description
Cholinergic drugs usually act in one of two ways.
Some directly mimic the effect of acetylcholine, whileothers block the effects of acetylcholinesterase. Acetyl-cholinesterase is an enzyme that destroys naturallyoccurring acetylcholine. By blocking the enzyme, thenaturally occurring acetylcholine has a longer action.
Recommended dosage
Cholinergic drugs are available only by prescription.
They may be available as eye drops, capsules, tablets, orinjections.
Precautions
Cholinergic drugs should be avoided when the
patient has any sort of obstruction in the urinary or diges-tive tracts, such a a tumor, or severe inflammation whichis causing blockage.
They should be used with caution in patients with
asthma , epilepsy, slow heart beat, hyperthyroidism ,o r
gastric ulcers.
The effects of the cholinergic drugs are to produce"
"gastric ulcers.
The effects of the cholinergic drugs are to produce
the same effects as stimulation of the parasympatheticnervous system. These effects include slowing of theheartbeat, increases in normal secretions including the

"digestive acids of the stomach, saliva and tears. For this
reason, patients who already have a problem in one ofthese areas, such as a slow heartbeat or stomach ulcersshould use these drugs with great caution, since the med-ication will make their conditions worse.
Side effects
When used properly, cholinergic drugs will increase
muscle strength in patients with myasthenia gravis . In

"Chondromalacia patellae
Definition
Chondromalacia patellae refers to the progressive
erosion of the articular cartilage of the knee joint, that isthe cartilage underlying the kneecap (patella) that articu-lates with the knee joint.
Description
Chondromalacia patellae (CMP), also known as
patello-femoral pain syndrome or patello-femoral stress
syndrome, is a syndrome that causes pain/discomfort atthe front of the knee. It is associated with irritation orwear on the underside of the kneecap, or patella. In a nor-mal knee, the articular cartilage is smooth and elastic andglides smoothly over the surface of the thighbone, orfemur when the knee is bent. Erosion of the cartilageroughens the surface and prevents this smooth action.
CMP is most common in adolescent females,
although older people may also develop it. An average oftwo out of 10,000 people develop this condition, many ofthem runners or other athletes.
Causes and symptoms

"Causes and symptoms
CMP is the result of the normal aging process,
overuse, injury, or uneven pressures exerted on the kneejoint. In teens, CMP may be caused by uneven growth oruneven strength in the thigh muscles. Growth spurts,common in teens, may result in a mildly abnormal align-ment of the patella, which increases the angle formed bythe thigh and the patellar tendon (Q-angle). This condi-tion adds to the damage. Symptoms include pain, nor-mally around the kneecap, and a grinding sensation feltwhen extending the leg. The pain may radiate to the backof the knee, or it may be intermittent and brought on bysquatting, kneeling, going up or down stairs, especiallydown, or by repeated bending of the joint.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is established during a physical examina-
tion performed by a general practitioner or an orthope-
dist, and is based on frequency of symptoms and con-firmed by x rays of the knee. The CMP erosion can also"

"be seen on an MRI, although this type of scan is not rou-
tinely performed for this purpose. The patient shouldinform the doctor about any previous injuries to the joint.
Treatment
Initial treatment may consist of resting the knee
using crutches, along with aspirin , Tylenol, or a non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such asMotrin for seven to 10 days. The person should limitsports activity until the joint is healed and may use icefollowed by heat to decrease inflammation. When thedoctor allows the patient to resume sports, a knee bracemay be prescribed in the form of a stabilizer with a holeat the kneecap.
Treatment also includes low impact exercises to
strengthen the quadriceps muscles which help stabilizethe knee joint. Physical therapy may be suggested at thestart of this program so as to help the patient learn thecorrect method of performing the exercises.

"Approximately 85% of people do well with conserv-
ative CMP treatment. The remainder still have severepain and may require arthroscopic surgery to repair the
tissues inside the knee joint. In more severe cases, opensurgery may be required to realign the kneecap and per-haps other corrections.
Alternative treatments
Physical therapy offers treatments that may help
CMP patients. Aqua therapy has the benefit of exercisingthe knee without putting stress on it and it also strength-ens the thigh muscles. Biofeedback can be used to learn
tensing and relaxing specific muscles to relieve pain.These techniques have the benefit of no side effects.Massage therapy might be beneficial as well. Calcium,
minerals , and vitamins as part of a balanced diet will
aid healing and help prevent further problems.KEY TERMS

Proper exercises are the best preventive measure.
Since tightness of thigh muscles is a risk factor, warmingup before athletic activities is recommended, as well asparticipating in a variety of sports rather than just one.Stretching exercises increase flexibility of the quadri-ceps, hip flexors, and hamstrings. Strengthening exercis-es such as short arc leg extensions, straight leg raises,quadriceps isometric exercises, and stationary bicyclingare also recommended.

the reproductive organs. Some originate in the testes orovaries, especially in young adults. Others develop in theuterus after a pregnancy or miscarriage—particularly
often after a mole. A few choriocarcinomas arise in sitesoutside the reproductive organs. Such “extragonadal”tumors are usually found in young adults and are morecommon in males.
Choriocarcinomas are one of the most dangerous
germ cell cancers. Choriocarcinomas usually growquickly and spread widely. Occasionally, this cancergrows so fast that the original tumor outgrows its bloodsupply and dies, leaving behind only a small scar.

Diagnosis
Choriocarcinomas are usually referred to an
oncologist, a doctor who specializes in cancer treat-ment. To diagnose this tumor, the doctor will do aphysical examination and examine the internal
organs with x rays or ultrasound studies. Choriocarci-nomas are not always biopsied before being treated,because they tend to bleed heavily. Spreading of thecancer is detected with x rays, ultrasound studies,computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scans.
Most choriocarcinomas make human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone normally found onlyduring pregnancy. The presence of hCG in the blood canhelp diagnose this cancer and monitor the success oftreatment."

"Treatment
Choriocarcinomas are usually treated by surgical
removal of the tumor and chemotherapy . Radiation is
occasionally used, particularly for tumors in the brain.
Alternative treatment
Complementary treatments can decrease stress ,
reduce the side effects of cancer treatment, and helppatients feel more in control. For instance, some peoplefind activities such as yoga , massage, music therapy ,
meditation , prayer, or mild physical exercise helpful.
Prognosis
The prognosis for choriocarcinomas in the uterus is
very good. Although these tumors have often spreadthroughout the body, chemotherapy results in a cure orremission in at least 80–90% of cases. Women who havehad choriocarcinomas often go on to have normal preg-nancies and deliveries.

"Choriocarcinomas in other sites have a poorer prog-
nosis. These tumors tend to spread quickly and don’talways respond well to chemotherapy. Although treat-ment can be effective, the outcome usually depends onhow widely the cancer is dispersed. Generally, the prog-nosis is worse if the cancer can be found in the liver orbrain, if hCG levels are high, or if the original tumordeveloped outside the gonads. Five-year survival withtesticular cancers can range from 92% for tumors thathave spread only to the lungs to 48% to tumors that havespread to other internal organs.
Prevention
There is no known means of prevention. However,
early detection of the symptoms and prompt medicaltreatment can improve the odds of survival.

Chorionic villus sampling
Definition
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), also known as
chorionic villus biopsy, is a prenatal test that can detectgenetic and chromosomal abnormalities of an unborn baby.
Purpose"
"Purpose
Chorionic villus sampling is performed on pregnant
women who are at risk for carrying a fetus with a genet-ic or chromosomal defect. Although it carries a slightlyhigher risk, CVS may be used in place of amniocentesis
for women who have one or more of the following riskfactors:
• Women age 35 and older. The chance of having a child
with Down syndrome increases with maternal age. For
instance, the chance of having a baby with Down syn-drome is one in 378 for a 35-year-old woman andincreases to one in 30 for a 45-year-old woman.
• A history of miscarriages or children born with birth
defects .
• A family history of genetic disease. Prenatal genetic
testing is recommended if either the mother or father of

"the unborn baby has a family history of genetic disease
or is known to be a carrier of a genetic disease.
Precautions
Chorionic villus sampling is not recommended for
women who have vaginal bleeding or spotting during thepregnancy . It is not typically recommended for women
who have Rh sensitization from a previous pregnancy.
Description
Chorionic villus sampling has been in use since the
1980s. This prenatal testing procedure involves taking asample of the chorion frondosum—that part of the chori-onic membrane containing the villi—for laboratoryanalysis. The chorionic membrane is the outer sac whichsurrounds the developing fetus. Chorionic villi aremicroscopic, finger-like projections that emerge from thechorionic membrane and eventually form the placenta.The cells that make up the chorionic villi are of fetal ori-gin so laboratory analysis can identify any genetic, chro-mosomal, or biochemical diseases of the fetus.Chorionic villus sampling is best performed"
"between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. The procedure isperformed either through the vagina and the cervix(transcervically) or through the abdomen (transabdomi-nally) depending upon the preferences of the patient orthe doctor. In some cases, the location of the placentadictates which method the doctor uses. Both methods areequally safe and effective. Following the preparationtime, both procedures take only about five minutes.Women undergoing chorionic villus sampling may expe-rience no pain at all or feel cramping or pinching. Occa-
sionally, a second sampling procedure must be per-formed if insufficient villus material was obtained.

In the transcervical procedure, as depicted above, the physician uses ultrasound to help guide a catheterthrough the cervix into the uterus. By applying suction from the syringe attached to the other end of the catheter, a smallsample of the chorionic villi are obtained.

By applying suctionfrom the syringe attached to the other end of the catheter,a small sample of the chorionic villi are obtained. Acramping or pinching feeling may be felt as the sample isbeing taken. The catheter is then easily withdrawn.
For the transabdominal method, the woman lies on
her back on an examining table. Ultrasound enables thedoctor to locate the placenta. The specific area on thewoman’s abdomen is cleansed thoroughly with an anti-septic and a local anesthetic may be injected to numb thearea. With ultrasound guidance, a long needle is insertedthrough the woman’s abdominal wall, through the uterinewall and to the chorionic villi. The sample is obtained byapplying suction from the syringe.

Humanshave 23 pairs of chromosomes including the sex chromo-somes. Rearrangements of the chromosomes or the pres-ence of additional or fewer chromosomes can be identifiedby examination of the photograph. Down syndrome, forinstance, is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.

"performed, results may be available as early as two days orup to eight days after the procedure.
Chorionic villus sampling costs between $1,200 and
$1,800. Insurance coverage for this test may vary.
Alternate procedures
There are alternate procedures for diagnosing genet-
ic and chromosomal disorders of the fetus. Amniocente-sis is commonly used and involves inserting a needlethrough the pregnant woman’s abdomen to obtain a sam-ple of amniotic fluid. Amniocentesis is usually per-formed in the second trimester at approximately 16weeks gestation and the laboratory analysis may take twoto three weeks. The two advantages of chorionic villussampling are that it is performed during the first trimesterand the results are available in about one week. However,as of 1997, amniocentesis is being performed in the firsttrimester, but this is still very rare. The risk of miscar-
riage after amniocentesis is 0.5–1% (one to two women"
"riage after amniocentesis is 0.5–1% (one to two women
out of 200) which is lower than that for chorionic villussampling (1–3%).
A noninvasive alternative is the maternal blood test
called triple marker screening or multiple marker screen-ing. A sample of the pregnant woman’s blood is analyzedfor three different markers: alphafetoprotein (AFP),human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol.The levels of these three markers in the mother’s bloodcan identify unborn babies who are at risk for certaingenetic or chromosomal defects. This is a screening testwhich determines the chance that the fetus has the defect,but it can not diagnose defects. A negative test resultdoes not necessarily mean the unborn baby does not havea birth defect. For instance, this screening test can onlypredict 60–70% of the fetuses with Down syndrome.Pregnant women who have a positive triple marker

"screen are encouraged to undergo a diagnostic test, such
as amniocentesis (by the time an AFP is done, it is toolate to perform a CVS).
Preparation
Prior to the chorionic villus sampling procedure the
woman needs to drink fluids and refrain from urinatingto ensure her bladder is full. These preparations create abetter ultrasound picture.
Aftercare
It is generally recommended that women undergoing
chorionic villus sampling have someone drive themhome and have no plans for the rest of the day. Womenwith Rh negative blood must receive a Rho (D) immuneglobulin injection following the procedure. Womenshould call their doctor if they experience excessivebleeding, vaginal discharge, fever , or abdominal pain
after the procedure.

Risks
Of women who undergo transcervical chorionic vil-

Two to three women out of 100 (or 2–3%) will mis-carry following chorionic villus sampling. The risk ofinfection is very low. Rupture of the amniotic mem-branes is a rare complication. Women with Rh negativeblood may be at an increased risk for developing Rhincompatibility following chorionic villus sampling.
There have been reports of limb defects in babies
following chorionic villus sampling. However, in 1996the World Health Organization reported that the inci-dence of babies born with limb defects from 138,966women who had undergone chorionic villus samplingwas the same as for women who had not. Therefore, thisstudy found no connection between chorionic villus sam-pling and limb defects.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a condition that
causes extreme tiredness. People with CFS have debili-tating fatigue that lasts for six months or longer. Theyalso have many other symptoms. Some of these are pain
in the joints and muscles, headache , and sore throat .
CFS does not have a known cause, but appears to resultfrom a combination of factors.

Scientists have also found high levelsof other viral antibodies in the blood of people with CFS.These findings have led many scientists to believe that avirus or combination of viruses may trigger CFS.

"CFS was sometimes referred to as Yuppie flu because
it seemed to often affect young, middle-class profession-als. In fact, CFS can affect people of any gender, age,race, or socioeconomic group. Although anyone can getCFS, most patients diagnosed with CFS are 25–45 yearsold, and about 80% of cases are in women. Estimates ofhow many people are afflicted with CFS vary due to thesimilarity of CFS symptoms to other diseases and the dif-ficulty in identifying it. The Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC) has estimated that four to 10 peo-ple per 100,000 in the United States have CFS. Accordingto the CFIDS Foundation, about 500,000 adults in theUnited States (0.3% of the population) have CFS. Thisprobably is a low estimate since these figures do notinclude children and are based on the CDC definition ofCFS, which is very strict for research purposes.

have pointed to several different conditions that might beresponsible. These include:

tors and researchers now think that CFS may not be asingle illness. Instead, they think CFS may be a group ofsymptoms caused by several conditions. One theory is"

About 90% of allpeople have a virus in the herpes family dormant (notactively growing or reproducing) in their bodies sincechildhood. When these viruses start growing again, theimmune system may overreact and produce chemicalscalled cytokines that can cause flu-like symptoms.Immune abnormalities have been found in studies ofpeople with CFS, although the same abnormalities arealso found in people with allergies, autoimmune dis-eases, cancer , and other disorders.

However, many people with CFS did nothave psychological disorders before getting the illness.Many doctors think that patients become depressed oranxious because of the effects of the symptoms of theirCFS. One recent study concluded that depression was theresult of CFS and was not its cause.

"Having CFS is not just a matter of being tired. Peo-
ple with CFS have severe fatigue that keeps them fromperforming their normal daily activities. They find it dif-ficult or impossible to work, attend school, or even totake part in social activities. They may have sleep distur-bances that keep them from getting enough rest or theymay sleep too much. Many people with CFS feel just astired after a full night’s sleep as before they went to bed.When they exercise or try to be active in spite of their
fatigue, people with CFS experience what some patientscall “payback”—debilitating exhaustion that can confinethem to bed for days.
Other symptoms of CFS include:
• muscle pain (myalgia)
• joint pain (arthralgia)

A recent study at Johns Hopkins University found an
abnormality in blood pressure regulation in 22 of 23patients with CFS. This abnormality, called neurallymediated hypotension , causes a sudden drop in blood
pressure when a person has been standing, exercising orexposed to heat for a while. When this occurs, patients

for hours to days after one of these episodes. When treat-ed with salt and medications to stabilize blood pressure,many patients in the study had marked improvements intheir CFS symptoms.
Diagnosis
CFS is diagnosed by evaluating symptoms and elim-
inating other causes of fatigue. Doctors carefully ques-tion patients about their symptoms, any other illnessesthey have had, and medications they are taking. Theyalso conduct a physical examination , neurological
examination, and laboratory tests to identify any underly-ing disorders or other diseases that cause fatigue. In theUnited States, many doctors use the CDC case definitionto determine if a patient has CFS.

"Treatment
There is no cure for CFS, but many treatments are
available to help relieve the symptoms. Treatments usual-ly are individualized to each person’s particular symp-toms and needs. The first treatment most doctors recom-mend is a combination of rest, exercise, and a balanceddiet. Prioritizing activities, avoiding overexertion, andresting when needed are key to maintaining existingenergy reserves. A program of moderate exercise helps tokeep patients from losing physical conditioning, but toomuch exercise can worsen fatigue and other CFS symp-toms. Counseling and stress reduction techniques also
may help some people with CFS.
Many medications, nutritional supplements, and herbal
preparations have been used to treat CFS. While many ofthese are unproven, others seem to provide some peoplewith relief. People with CFS should discuss their treatmentKEY TERMS

Prognosis
The course of CFS varies widely for different peo-
ple. Some people get progressively worse over time,while others gradually improve. Some individuals haveperiods of illness that alternate with periods of goodhealth. While many people with CFS never fully regaintheir health, they find relief from symptoms and adapt tothe demands of the disorder by carefully following a
treatment plan combining adequate rest, nutrition ,e x e r -
cise, and other therapies.
Prevention
Because the cause of CFS is not known, there current-
ly are no recommendations for preventing the disorder.

Chronic granulomatous
disease
Definition
Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherit-
ed disorder in which white blood cells lose their ability todestroy certain bacteria and fungi.
Description
CGD is an X-linked genetic disease, meaning the
defective gene is carried on the X chromosome (oneof the sex chromosomes). Females have two copies ofthe X chromosome, whereas males have one X andone Y . CGD also is a recessive defect meaning thatboth copies of the chromosome must have the defectbefore it can be expressed. Females who have one Xchromosome without the defect do not get this dis-ease. Males, since they only have one X chromosome,get the disease if the defect is present. Thus, CGDaffects mostly males.
CGD is an immunodeficiency disorder. Patients"
"with immunodeficiency disorders suffer frequent infec-tions. This happens because part of their immune systemisn’t working properly and the infectious microorgan-isms are not killed as rapidly as is normal. In CGD thereis a defect in the ability of the white blood cells to killbacteria and fungi. The white blood cells affected arephagocytic cells. They are part of the non-specificimmune system and move via the blood to all parts of thebody where they ingest and destroy microbes. Phagocyt-ic cells are the first line of defense against microorgan-isms. In this disease, the decreased ability to killmicrobes that they have ingested leads to a failure toeffectively combat infectious diseases. Patients withCGD are subject to certain types of recurring infection,especially those of the skin, lungs, mouth, nose,intestines, and lymph nodes. With the exception of thelymph nodes, all of these areas are considered externaltissues that come into contact with microorganisms fromthe environment. The"
are considered externaltissues that come into contact with microorganisms fromthe environment. The lymph system drains all areas ofthe body to eliminate destroyed microorganisms and toassist the immune system in attacking microorganisms.Infections occur in the lymph nodes as a consequence ofthe normal draining function.KEY TERMS
"Immunodeficiency —A weakening of the body’s
immune system.
Phagocytic cells —A cell that ingests microorgan-
isms and foreign particles.
Causes and symptoms
The genetic defect that causes CGD reduces the
amount of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide that whiteblood cells can make. These chemicals are important forkilling bacteria and fungi. Without them the white bloodcells ingest the microorganisms, but can’t kill them. Insome cases, the microbes then replicate inside the whiteblood cell eventually causing its death .
Symptoms of the disease usually appear by age two.
Frequent, recurrent infections of the skin, lungs (e.g.pneumonia ), mouth (e.g. gingivitis), nose, intestines and
lymph nodes are a hallmark of this disease. Patients mayalso develop multiple, recurrent liver abscesses and boneinfections ( osteomyelitis ).

"Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made based on the observation of a pat-
tern of recurrent infections. Blood tests of lymphocyteand antibody functions will be normal. Tests of phago-cytic cells will show normal ingestion, but a greatlydecreased ability to kill bacteria.
Treatment
Early, aggressive treatment of all infections is criti-
cal to the successful management of CGD. Patients aretreated with antibiotics and immune serum. Antibiotics
are used at the first sign of infection. Immune serum is asource of antibodies that help fight infections. Interferongamma is an experimental treatment for CGD that hasshown promising results. There is no cure for the under-lying cause of chronic granulomatous disease
Prognosis
Although antibiotics can treat most infections and
may help prevent others, premature death may result,typically due to repeated lung infections.

antibiotics may help keep some infections from occur-ring, and good hygiene, especially rigorous skin andmouth care, can help prevent infections in these areas.Avoiding crowds or other people who have infections arealso effective preventive measures.

Chronic kidney failure, also known as chronic renal"
"Description
Chronic kidney failure, also known as chronic renal
failure, affects over 250,000 Americans annually. It iscaused by a number of diseases and inherited disorders,but the progression of chronic kidney failure is always thesame. The kidneys, which serve as the body’s natural fil-tration system, gradually lose their ability to remove flu-ids and waste products (urea) from the bloodstream. Theyalso fail to regulate certain chemicals in the bloodstream,and deposit protein into the urine. Chronic kidney failureis irreversible, and will eventually lead to total kidneyfailure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD).Without proper treatment intervention to remove wastesand fluids from the bloodstream, ESRD is fatal.
Causes and symptoms
Kidney failure is triggered by disease or a hereditary
disorder in the kidneys. Both kidneys are typically affect-ed. The four most common causes of chronic kidney fail-ure include:
• Diabetes. Diabetes mellitus (DM), both insulin depen-"
"• Diabetes. Diabetes mellitus (DM), both insulin depen-
dant (IDDM) and non-insulin dependant (NIDDM),occurs when the body cannot produce and/or useinsulin, the hormone necessary for the body to processglucose. Long-term diabetes may cause the glomeruli,the filtering units located in the nephrons of the kid-neys, to gradually lose functioning.
•Glomerulonephritis . Glomerulonephritis is a chronic
inflammation of the glomeruli, or filtering units of thekidney. Certain types of glomerulonephritis are treat-able, and may only cause a temporary disruption of kid-ney functioning.
•Hypertension . High blood pressure is unique in that it
is both a cause and a major symptom of kidney failure.The kidneys can become stressed and ultimately sustainpermanent damage from blood pushing through them atan excessive level of pressure over a long period of time.
•Polycystic kidney disease . Polycystic kidney disease is"
"•Polycystic kidney disease . Polycystic kidney disease is
an inherited disorder that causes cysts to be formed onthe nephrons, or functioning units, of the kidneys. Thecysts hamper the regular functioning of the kidney.
Other possible causes of chronic kidney failure
include kidney cancer , obstructions such as kidney
stones ,pyelonephritis , reflux nephropathy, systemic
lupus erythematosus ,amyloidosis , sickle cell anemia,
Alport syndrome , and oxalosis.
Initially, symptoms of chronic kidney failure devel-
op slowly. Even individuals with mild to moderate kid-ney failure may show few symptoms in spite of increasedurea in their blood. Among the symptoms that may bepresent at this point are frequent urination during thenight and high blood pressure.
Most symptoms of chronic kidney failure are not
apparent until kidney disease has progressed significant-ly. Common symptoms include:
• Anemia. The kidneys are responsible for the production"
"• Anemia. The kidneys are responsible for the production
of erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone which stimulates redblood cell production. If kidney disease causes shrinkingof the kidney, this red cell production is hampered.
• Bad breath or a bad taste in mouth. Urea, or waste prod-
ucts, in the saliva may cause an ammonia-like taste inthe mouth.
• Bone and joint problems. The kidneys produce vitamin
D, which aids in the absorption of calcium and keepsbones strong. For patients with kidney failure, bonesmay become brittle, and in the case of children, normalgrowth may be stunted. Joint pain may also occur as a
result of unchecked phosphate levels in the blood.

"• Edema. Puffiness or swelling around the eyes, arms,
hands, and feet.
• Frequent urination.
• Foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may cause
it to foam significantly. Blood in the urine may indicatebleeding from diseased or obstructed kidneys, bladder,or ureters.
• Headaches. High blood pressure may trigger headaches.• Hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention of
fluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase,which in turn, causes blood pressure to rise.
• Increased fatigue . Toxic substances in the blood and the
presence of anemia may cause feelings of exhaustion.
•Itching . Phosphorus, which is typically eliminated in
the urine, accumulates in the blood of patients with kid-ney failure. This heightened phosphorus level maycause itching of the skin.
• Lower back pain. Pain where the kidneys are located, in
the small of the back below the ribs.

• Nausea, loss of appetite, and vomiting. Urea in the gas-
tric juices may cause upset stomach. This can lead tomalnutrition and weight loss.
Diagnosis
Kidney failure is typically diagnosed and treated by a
nephrologist, a doctor that specializes in treating the kid-neys. The patient that is suspected of having chronic kid-ney failure will undergo an extensive blood work-up. Ablood test will assess the levels of creatinine, blood ureanitrogen (BUN), uric acid, phosphate, sodium, and potas-sium in the blood. Urine samples will also be collected,usually over a 24-hour period, to assess protein loss.
Uncovering the cause of kidney failure is critical to"
"Uncovering the cause of kidney failure is critical to
proper treatment. A full assessment of the kidneys is nec-essary to determine if the underlying disease is treatableand if the kidney failure is chronic or acute. An x ray,MRI, computed tomography scan, ultrasound, renalbiopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneys may beemployed to determine the cause of kidney failure andlevel of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultra-sound of the bladder and/or ureters may also be taken.
Treatment
Chronic kidney failure is an irreversible condition.
Hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplan-
tation must be employed to replace the lost function of
the kidneys. In addition, dietary changes and treatment torelieve specific symptoms such as anemia and high bloodpressure are critical to the treatment process.KEY TERMS

Nephrotic syndrome —Characterized by protein

Ureters —The two ducts that pass urine from each
kidney to the bladder.
Hemodialysis
Hemodialysis is the most frequently prescribed type"
"of dialysis treatment in the United States. Mosthemodialysis patients require treatment three times aweek, for an average of three to four hours per dialysis“run” depending on the type of dialyzer used and theircurrent physical condition. The treatment involves circu-lating the patient’s blood outside of the body through anextracorporeal circuit (ECC), or dialysis circuit. Thedialysis circuit consists of plastic blood tubing, a two-compartment filter known as a dialyzer, or artificial kid-ney, and a dialysis machine that monitors and maintainsblood flow and administers dialysate, a chemical bathused to draw waste products out of the blood. Thepatient’s blood leaves and enters the body through twoneedles inserted into the patient’s vein, called an accesssite, and is pushed through the blood compartment of thedialyzer. Once inside of the dialyzer, excess fluids andtoxins are pulled out of the bloodstream and into thedialysate compartment, where they are carried out of thebody. At the"

"Peritoneal dialysis
In peritoneal dialysis (PD), the patient’s peritoneum,
or lining of the abdomen, acts as a blood filter. A catheteris surgically inserted into the patient’s abdomen. Duringtreatment, the catheter is used to fill the abdominal cavitywith dialysate. Waste products and excess fluids movefrom the patient’s bloodstream into the dialysate solu-tion. After a waiting period of six to 24 hours, dependingon the treatment method used, the waste-filled dialysateis drained from the abdomen, and replaced with cleandialysate. There are three types of peritoneal dialysis,which vary by treatment time and administrationmethod: Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis

and Intermittent Peritoneal Dialysis (IPD).
Kidney transplantation
Kidney transplantation involves surgically attaching
a functioning kidney, or graft, from a brain dead organdonor (a cadaver transplant), or from a living donor, to apatient with ESRD. Patients with chronic renal diseasewho need a transplant and don’t have a living donor reg-ister with UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing),the federal organ procurement agency, to be placed on awaiting list for a cadaver kidney transplant. Kidney avail-ability is based on the patient’s health status. When thenew kidney is transplanted, the patient’s existing, dis-eased kidneys may or may not be removed, depending onthe circumstances surrounding the kidney failure. A regi-men of immunosuppressive, or anti-rejection medication,is required after transplantation surgery.
Dietary management

"Dietary management
A diet low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorous,
three substances that the kidneys regulate, is critical inmanaging kidney disease. Other dietary restrictions, suchas a reduction in protein, may be prescribed dependingon the cause of kidney failure and the type of dialysistreatment employed. Patients with chronic kidney failurealso need to limit their fluid intake.
Medications and dietary supplements
Kidney failure patients with hypertension typically
take medication to control their high blood pressure.Epoetin alfa, or EPO (Epogen), a hormone therapy, andintravenous or oral iron supplements are used to manageanemia. A multivitamin may be prescribed to replace vit-
amins lost during dialysis treatments. Vitamin D, which
promotes the absorption of calcium, along with calciumsupplements, may also be prescribed.
Since 1973, Medicare has picked up 80% of ESRD"
"Since 1973, Medicare has picked up 80% of ESRD
treatment costs, including the costs of dialysis and trans-plantation and of some medications. To qualify for bene-fits, a patient must be insured or eligible for benefitsunder Social Security, or be a spouse or child of an eligi-ble American. Private insurance and state Medicaid pro-grams often cover the remaining 20% of treatment costs.
Prognosis
Early diagnosis and treatment of kidney failure is criti-
cal to improving length and quality of life in chronic kidneyfailure patients. Patient outcome varies by the cause ofchronic kidney failure and the method chosen to treat it.Overall, patients with chronic kidney disease leading toESRD have a shortened lifespan. According to the United
States Renal Data System (USRDS), the lifespan of anESRD patient is 18–47% of the lifespan of the age-sex-racematched general population. ESRD patients on dialysishave a lifespan that is 16–37% of the general population."
"The demand for kidneys to transplant continues to
exceed supply. In 1996, over 34,000 Americans were onthe UNOS waiting list for a kidney transplant, but only11,330 living donor and cadaver transplants were actual-ly performed. Cadaver kidney transplants have a 50%chance of functioning nine years, and living donor kid-neys that have two matching antigen pairs have a 50%chance of functioning for 24 years. However, some trans-plant grafts have functioned for over 30 years.

disease
Definition
Chronic obstructive lung disease, also known as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is a gen-eral term for a group of conditions in which there is per-sistent difficulty in expelling (or exhaling) air from thelungs. COPD commonly refers to two related, progres-sive diseases of the respiratory system, chronic bronchi-
tisand emphysema . Because smoking is the major
cause of both diseases, chronic bronchitis and emphyse-ma often occur together in the same patient.

COPD is one of the fastest-growing health prob-
lems. Nearly 16 million people in the United States, 14million with chronic bronchitis and two million withemphysema, suffer from COPD. COPD is responsiblefor more than 96,000 deaths annually, making it thefourth leading cause of death . Although COPD is more"
"common in men than women, the increase in incidenceof smoking among women since World War II has pro-duced an increase in deaths from COPD in women.COPD has a large economic impact on the healthcaresystem and a destructive impact on the lives of patientsand their families. Quality of life for a person withCOPD decreases as the disease progresses.
Chronic bronchitis
In chronic bronchitis, chronic inflammation caused
by cigarette smoking results in a narrowing of the open-ings in the bronchi, the large air tubes of the respiratorysystem, and interferes with the flow of air. Inflammationalso causes the glands that line the bronchi to produceexcessive amounts of mucus, further narrowing the air-ways and blocking airflow. The result is often a chroniccough that produces sputum (mainly mucus) and short-
ness of breath . Cigarette smoke also damages the cilia,
small hair-like projections that move bacteria and foreignparticles out of the lungs, increasing the risk of infections.
Emphysema"
"Emphysema
Emphysema is a disease in which cigarette smoke
causes an overproduction of the enzyme elastase, one ofthe immune system’s infection-fighting biochemicals.This results in irreversible destruction of a protein in thelung called elastin which is important for maintaining thestructure of the walls of the alveoli, the terminal small airsacs of the respiratory system. As the walls of the alveolirupture, the number of alveoli is reduced and many ofthose remaining are enlarged, making the lungs of thepatient with emphysema less elastic and overinflated.Due to the higher pressure inside the chest that must bedeveloped to force air out of the less-elastic lungs, thebronchioles, small air tubes of the respiratory system,tend to collapse during exhalation. Stale air gets trappedin the air sacs and fresh air cannot be brought in.
Causes and symptoms
There are several important risk factors for COPD:
• Lifestyle. Cigarette smoking is by far the most important"
"• Lifestyle. Cigarette smoking is by far the most important
risk factor for COPD (80% of all cases). Cigar and pipesmoking can also cause COPD. Air pollution and indus-trial dusts and fumes are other important risk factors.
• Age. Chronic bronchitis is more common in people
over 40 years old; emphysema occurs more often inpeople 65 years of age and older.
• Socioeconomic class. COPD-related deaths are about
twice as high among unskilled and semi-skilled labor-ers as among professionals.
• Family clustering. It is thought that heredity predispos-
es people in certain families to the development ofCOPD when other causes, such as smoking and air pol-lution, are present.
• Lung infections. Lung infections make all forms of
COPD worse.
In the general population, emphysema usually devel-"
"COPD worse.
In the general population, emphysema usually devel-
ops in older individuals with a long smoking history. How-ever, there is also a form of emphysema that runs in fami-lies. People with this type of emphysema have a hereditarydeficiency of a blood component, an enzyme inhibitorcalled alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT). This type of emphysemais sometimes called “early onset emphysema” because itcan appear when a person is as young as 30 or 40 yearsold. It is estimated that there are between 75,000 and150,000 Americans who were born with AAT-deficiency.Of this group, emphysema afflicts an estimated 20,000-40,000 people (1–3% of all cases of emphysema). The riskof developing emphysema for an AAT-deficient individualwho also smokes is much greater than for others.
The first symptoms of chronic bronchitis are cough"
"The first symptoms of chronic bronchitis are cough
and mucus production. These symptoms resemble a chestcold that lingers on for weeks. Later, shortness of breathdevelops. Cough, sputum production, and shortness ofbreath may become worse if a person develops a lunginfection. A person with chronic bronchitis may later

"develop emphysema as well. In emphysema, shortness of
breath on exertion is the predominant early symptom.Coughing is usually minor and there is little sputum. Asthe disease progresses, the shortness of breath occurswith less exertion, and eventually may be present evenwhen at rest. At this point, a sputum-producing coughmay also occur. Either chronic bronchitis or emphysemamay lead to respiratory failure—a condition in whichthere occurs a dangerously low level of oxygen or a seri-ous excess of carbon dioxide in the blood.
Diagnosis
The first step in diagnosing COPD is a good medical
evaluation, including a medical history and a physical
examination of the chest using a stethoscope. In addition,
the doctor may request one or more of the following tests:
Pulmonary function test

"Pulmonary function test
Using a spirometer, an instrument that measures the air
taken into and exhaled from the lungs, the doctor will deter-mine two important values: (1) vital capacity (VC), the largestamount of air expelled after the deepest inhalation, and (2)forced expiratory volume (FEV1), the maximum amount ofair expired in one second. The pulmonary function test can
be performed in the doctor’s office, but is expensive.
Chest x ray
Chest x rays can detect only about half of the cases of
emphysema. Chest x rays are rarely useful for diagnosingchronic bronchitis.Blood gas levels
Blood may be drawn from an artery (more painful
than drawing blood from a vein) to determine the amountof oxygen and carbon dioxide present. Low oxygen andhigh carbon dioxide levels are often indicative of chronicbronchitis, but not always of emphysema.
Tests for cause of infection
If infection is present, blood and sputum tests may
be done to determine the cause of infection.
Electrocardiogram (ECG)"
"be done to determine the cause of infection.
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Many patients with lung disease also develop heart
problems. The ECG identifies signs of heart disease.
Treatment
The precise nature of the patient’s condition will
determine the type of treatment prescribed for COPD.With a program of complete respiratory care, disabilitycan be minimized, acute episodes prevented, hospitaliza-tions reduced, and some early deaths avoided. On theother hand, no treatment has been shown to slow theprogress of the disease, and only oxygen therapy increas-es survival rate.
Drugs
Medications frequently prescribed for COPD
patients include:

"•Bronchodilators . These agents open narrowed airways
and offer significant symptomatic relief for many, butnot all, people with COPD. There are three types ofbronchodilators: Beta2 agonists, anticholinergic agents,and theophylline and its derivatives. Depending on thespecific drug, a bronchodilator may be inhaled, inject-ed, or taken orally.
•Corticosteroids . Corticosteroids, usually inhaled,
block inflammation and are most useful for patientswith chronic bronchitis with or without emphysema.Steroids are generally not useful in patients who haveemphysema.
• Oxygen replacement. Eventually, patients with low
blood oxygen levels may need to rely on supplementaloxygen from portable or stationary tanks.
•Antibiotics . Antibiotics are frequently given at the first
sign of a respiratory infection, such as increased spu-tum production or a change in color of sputum fromclear to yellow or green.
• Vaccines. To prevent pulmonary infection from viruses"
"• Vaccines. To prevent pulmonary infection from viruses
and bacteria, people with COPD should be vaccinatedagainst influenza each year at least six weeks before
flu season and have a one-time pneumococcal ( pneu-
monia ) vaccine.
• Expectorants. These agents help loosen and expel
mucus secretions from the airways.
• Diuretics. These drugs are given to prevent excess
water retention in patients with associated right heart
failure .
• Augmentation therapy (for emphysema due to AAT-
deficiency only). Replacement AAT (Prolastin), derivedfrom human blood which has been screened for viruses,is injected weekly or bimonthly for life.
Surgery
Surgical procedures for emphysema are very rare.
They are expensive and often not covered by insurance.The great majority of patients cannot be helped bysurgery, and no single procedure is ideal for those whocan be helped. In January of 1996, the government tem-porarily suspended Medicare payments for lung reduc-tion surgery."
"•Lung transplantation . Lung transplantation has been
successfully employed in some patients with end-stageCOPD. In the hands of an experienced team, the one-year survival rate is over 70%.
• Lung volume reduction. These procedures remove
20–30% of severely diseased lung tissue; the remainingparts of the lung are joined together. Mortality rates canbe as high as 15% and complication rates are evenKEY TERMS

Pulmonary rehabilitation
A structured, outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation
program improves functional capacity in certain patientswith COPD. Services may include general exercise train-
ing, administration of oxygen and nutritional supplements,intermittent mechanical ventilatory support, continuouspositive airway pressure, relaxation techniques, breathingexercises and techniques (such as pursed lip breathing),and methods for mobilizing and removing secretions.
Alternative treatment
For both chronic bronchitis and emphysema, alter-
native practitioners recommend diet and nutritional sup-plements, a variety of herbal medicines, hydrotherapy ,"
"acupressure and acupuncture ,aromatherapy ,home-
opathy , and yoga .
Prognosis
COPD is a disease that can be treated and controlled,
but not cured. Survival of patients with COPD is clearlyrelated to the degree of their lung function when they are

"diagnosed and the rate at which they lose this function.
Overall, the median survival is about 10 years forpatients with COPD who have lost approximately two-thirds of their lung function at diagnosis.
Prevention
Lifestyle modifications that can help prevent COPD,
or improve function in COPD patients, include: quittingsmoking, avoiding respiratory irritants and infections,avoiding allergens, maintaining good nutrition , drinking
lots of fluids, avoiding excessively low or high tempera-tures and very high altitudes, maintaining proper weight,and exercising to increase muscle tone.

Purpose
In the United States, circumcision in infant boys is
performed for social, medical, or cultural/religious rea-sons. Once a routine operation urged by pediatriciansand obstetricians for newborns in the middle of the twen-tieth century, circumcision has become an elective optionthat parents make for their sons on an individual basis.Families who practice Judaism or Islam may select tohave their sons circumcised as a religious practice. Oth-ers choose circumcision for medical benefits.

"mutilation ) is usually performed for cultural and social
reasons by family members and others who are not mem-bers of the medical profession, with no anesthesia. Notonly is the prepuce removed but often the vaginal open-ing is sewn to make it smaller. This practice is supposedto ensure the virginity of a bride on her wedding day. Italso prevents the woman from achieving sexual pleasureduring coitus. This practice is not universally approvedby the medical profession and is considered by some as ahuman rights violation.
Though the incidence of male circumcision has
decreased from 90% in 1979 to 60% in 1996, it is still themost common surgical operation in the United States.Circumcision rates are much lower for the rest of theindustrialized world. In Britain, it is only done for reli-gious practices or to correct a specific medical conditionof the penis.

"urinary tract infections (UTIs), the rate of incidence of
UTIs is quite low. There are also indications that cir-cumcised men are less likely to suffer from penile can-
cer, inflammation of the penis, or have many sexually
transmitted diseases. Here again, the rate of incidenceis low. Good hygiene usually prevents most infectionsof the penis. Phimosis and penile cancer are very rare,even in men who have not been circumcised. Educationand good safe sex practices can prevent sexually trans-mitted diseases in ways that a surgical procedure can-not because these are diseases acquired through riskybehaviors.

strong enough to recommended circumcision as a routine
practice.
Precautions
Circumcision should not be performed on infants
with certain deformities of the penis that may require aportion of the foreskin for repair. The most common con-dition for surgery using the foreskin is hypospadias, acongenital deformity of the penis where the urinary tractopening is not at the tip of the glans. Also, infants with alarge hydrocoele or hernia may suffer important compli-"
"cations through circumcision. Premature infants andinfants with serious infections are also poor candidates tobe circumcised, as are infants with hemophilia , other
bleeding disorders, or whose mothers had taken anticoag-ulant drugs. In older boys or men, circumcision is a minorprocedure. Therefore, it can be performed in virtuallyanyone without a serious illness or unusual deformity.
Description
The foreskin of the penis protects the sensitivity of
the glans and shields it from irritation by urine, feces,and foreign materials. It also protects the urinary openingagainst infection and incidental injury.
In circumcision of infants, the foreskin is pulled
tightly into a specially designed clamp, and the foreskinpulls away from the broadened tip of the penis. Pressurefrom the clamp stops bleeding from blood vessels thatsupplied the foreskin. In older boys or adults, an incisionis made around the base of the foreskin, the foreskin is

"pulled back, and then it is cut away from the tip of the
penis. Stitches are usually used to close the skin edges.
Preparation
Despite a long-standing belief that infants do not
experience serious pain from circumcision, most author-
ities now believe that some form of local anesthesia isnecessary. The physician injects local anesthesia at thebase of the penis or under the skin around the penis (sub-cutaneous ring block). Both anesthetics block keynerves. EMLA cream, a topical formula of several anes-thetics can also be used.
Aftercare
After circumcision, the wound should be washed
daily. An antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly may beapplied to the site. If there is an incision, a wound dress-ing will be present and should be changed each time thediaper is changed. Sometimes a plastic ring is usedinstead of a bandage. The ring will usually fall off in fiveto eight days. The penis will heal in seven to 10 days.

"Infants who undergo circumcision may be fussy for
some hours afterward, so parents should be prepared forcrying, feeding problems, and sleep problems. Generallythese go away within a day. In older boys, the penis may bepainful, but this will go away gradually. A topical anesthet-ic ointment or spray may be used to relieve this temporarydiscomfort. There may also be a “bruise” on the penis,which typically goes away with no particular attention.
Risks
Complications following newborn circumcision
appear in one out of every 500 procedures. Most compli-cations are minor. Bleeding occurs in half of the compli-cations and is usually easy to control. Infections are rare
and present with fever and signs of inflammation.

"There may be injuries to the penis itself, and these
may be difficult to repair. In 2000, there were reports thatthe surgical clamps used in circumcision were at fault inover 100 injuries reported between July 1996 and January2000. In nearly all cases, the clamps were assumed to bein working order but had been repaired with replacementparts that were not of the manufacturer’s specifications.Physicians were urged to inspect the clamps before useand ensure that their dimensions fit their infant patients.

Cirrhosis
Definition
Cirrhosis is a chronic, degenerative disease in which
normal liver cells are damaged and are then replaced byscar tissue.
Description
Cirrhosis changes the structure of the liver and the
blood vessels that nourish it. The disease reduces theliver’s ability to manufacture proteins and process hor-mones, nutrients, medications, and poisons.
Cirrhosis gets worse over time and can become
potentially life threatening. This disease can cause:
• excessive bleeding (hemorrhage)• impotence
• liver cancer
• coma due to accumulated ammonia and body wastes
(liver failure)

"•death
Cirrhosis is the seventh leading cause of disease-
related death in the United States. It is twice as commonin men as in women. The disease occurs in more thanhalf of all malnourished chronic alcoholics and killsabout 25,000 people a year. It is the third most commoncause of death in adults between the ages of 45 and 65.
Types of cirrhosis
Portal or nutritional cirrhosis is the form of the dis-
ease most common in the United States. About 30–50%of all cases of cirrhosis are this type. Nine out of every 10people who have nutritional cirrhosis have a history ofalcoholism . Portal or nutritional cirrhosis is also called
Laënnec’s cirrhosis.
Biliary cirrhosis is caused by intrahepatic bile-duct
diseases that impede bile flow. Bile is formed in the liverand is carried by ducts to the intestines. Bile then helpsdigest fats in the intestines. Biliary cirrhosis can scar orblock these ducts. It represents 15–20% of all cirrhosis.
Various types of chronic hepatitis, especially hepati-"
"Various types of chronic hepatitis, especially hepati-
tis B and hepatitis C , can cause postnecrotic cirrhosis.This form of the disease affects up to 40% of all patients
who have cirrhosis.
Disorders like the inability to metabolize iron and
similar disorders may cause pigment cirrhosis ( hemo-
chromatosis ), which accounts for 5–10% of all instances
of the disease.
Causes and symptoms
Long-term alcoholism is the primary cause of cir-
rhosis in the United States. Men and women respond dif-ferently to alcohol. Although most men can safely con-sume two to five drinks a day, one or two drinks a daycan cause liver damage in women. Individual tolerance toalcohol varies, but people who drink more and drinkmore often have a higher risk of developing cirrhosis. Insome people, one drink a day can cause liver scarring.
Chronic liver infections like hepatitis B and particu-"
"Chronic liver infections like hepatitis B and particu-
larly hepatitis C are commonly linked to cirrhosis. Peo-ple at high risk of contracting hepatitis B include thoseexposed to the virus through contact with blood and bodyfluids. This includes healthcare workers and intraveneous

"(IV) drug users. People in the past have contracted
hepatitis C through blood transfusions.
Liver injury, reactions to prescription medications,
exposure to toxic substances, and repeated episodes ofheart failure with liver congestion can cause cirrhosis.
The disorder can also be a result of diseases that run infamilies (inherited diseases) like:
• a lack of a specific liver enzyme (alpha
1-antitrypsin
deficiency)
• the absence of a milk-digesting enzyme (galactosemia)• an inability to convert sugars to energy (glycogen stor-
age disease)
• an absorption deficit in which excess iron is deposited in
the liver, pancreas, heart, and other organs (hemochro-matosis)
• a disorder characterized by accumulations of copper in
the liver, brain, kidneys, and corneas (Wilson’s disease)

"Poor nutrition increases a person’s risk of develop-
ing cirrhosis. In about 10 out of every 100 patients, thecause of cirrhosis cannot be determined. Many peoplewho have cirrhosis do not have any symptoms (oftencalled compensated cirrhosis). Their disease is detectedduring a routine physical or when tests for an unrelatedmedical problem are performed. This type of cirrhosiscan also be detected when complications occur (decom-pensated cirrhosis).
Symptoms of cirrhosis are usually caused by the loss
of functioning liver cells or organ swelling due to scarring.The liver enlarges during the early stages of illness. Thepalms of the hands turn red and patients may experience:
• constipation
• diarrhea
• dull abdominal pain
• fatigue• indigestion• loss of appetite• nausea• vomiting• weakness• weight loss

"fluid collects in the abdomen ( ascites ) and legs ( edema ).
Spider-like blood vessels appear on the chest and shoul-ders, and bruising becomes common. Men sometimeslose chest hair. Their breasts may grow and their testiclesmay shrink. Women may have menstrual irregularities.Cirrhosis can cause extremely dry skin and intense
itching . The whites of the eyes and the skin may turn
yellow ( jaundice ), and urine may be dark yellow or
brown. Stools may be black or bloody. Sometimes thepatient develops persistent high blood pressure due to thescarring (portal hypertension ). This type of hyperten-
sion can be life threatening. It can cause veins to enlargein the stomach and in the tube leading from the mouth tothe stomach (esophagus). These enlarged veins are calledvarices, and they can rupture and bleed massively.
Other symptoms of cirrhosis include:

"•f e v e r• fluid in the lungs
• hallucinations

• muscle weakness• musty breath
• painful nerve inflammation (neuritis)
• slurred speech
• tremors
If the liver loses its ability to remove toxins from the
brain, the patient may have additional symptoms. Thepatient may become forgetful and unresponsive, neglectpersonal care, have trouble concentrating, and acquirenew sleeping habits. These symptoms are related toammonia intoxication and the failure of the liver to con-vert ammonia to urea. High protein intake in thesepatients can also lead to these symptoms.
Diagnosis
A patient’s medical history can reveal illnesses or
lifestyles likely to lead to cirrhosis. Liver changes can beseen during a physical examination . A doctor who sus-
pects cirrhosis may order blood and urine tests to measureliver function. Because only a small number of healthycells are needed to carry out essential liver functions, testresults may be normal even when cirrhosis is present."
"Computed tomography scans (CT), ultrasound,
and other imaging techniques can be used during diagno-sis. They can help determine the size of the liver, indicatehealthy and scarred areas of the organ, and detect gall-
stones . Cirrhosis is sometimes diagnosed during surgery
or by examining the liver with a laparoscope. This view-

"ing device is inserted into the patient’s body through a
tiny incision in the abdomen.
Liver biopsy is usually needed to confirm a diagno-
sis of cirrhosis. In this procedure, a tissue sample isremoved from the liver and is examined under a micro-scope in order to learn more about the organ.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to cure or reduce the condi-
tion causing cirrhosis, prevent or delay disease progres-sion, and prevent or treat complications.
Salt and fluid intake are often limited, and activity is
encouraged. A diet high in calories and moderately high inprotein can benefit some patients. Tube feedings or vita-
min supplements may be prescribed if the liver continuesto deteriorate. Patients are asked not to consume alcohol.
Medication

"Medication
Iron supplements, diuretics , and antibiotics may be
used for anemia, fluid retention, and ammonia accumula-tion associated with cirrhosis. Vasoconstrictors are some-times needed to stop internal bleeding and antiemeticsmay be prescribed to control nausea.
Laxatives help the body absorb toxins and acceler-
ate their removal from the digestive tract. Beta blockers
may be prescribed to control cirrhosis-induced portalhypertension. Because the diseased liver can no longerefficiently neutralize harmful substances, medicationsmust be given with caution. Interferon medicines may beused by patients with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis Cto prevent post-hepatic cirrhosis.
Surgery

"Surgery
Medication that causes scarring can be injected
directly into veins to control bleeding from varices in thestomach or esophagus. Varices may require a special sur-gical procedure called balloon tamponade ligation to stopthe bleeding. Surgery may be required to repair disease-related throat damage. It is sometimes necessary toremove diseased portions of the spleen and other organs.
Liver transplants can benefit patients with advanced
cirrhosis. However, the new liver will eventually becomediseased unless the underlying cause of cirrhosis isremoved. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis must demon-strate a willingness to stop drinking before being consid-ered suitable transplant candidates.
Supportive measures
A balanced diet promotes regeneration of healthy
liver cells. Eating five or six small meals throughout theday should prevent the sick or bloated feeling patients
with cirrhosis often have after eating. Alcohol and caf-

was eaten, when it was eaten, and how the patient feltafterwards. This diary can be useful in identifying foodsthat are hard to digest and in scheduling meals to coin-cide with the times the patient is most hungry.
Patients who have cirrhosis should weigh them-
selves every day and notify their doctor of a sudden gainof five pounds or more. A doctor should also be notifiedif symptoms of cirrhosis appear in anyone who has notbeen diagnosed with the disease. A doctor should also benotified if a patient diagnosed with cirrhosis:
• vomits blood
• passes black stools• seems confused or unresponsive• shows signs of infection (redness, swelling, tenderness,
pain)

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for cirrhosis are aimed at pro-
moting the function of healthy liver cells and relieving thesymptoms associated with the disease. Several herbalremedies may be helpful to cirrhosis patients. Dandelion(Taraxacum officinale ) and rock-poppy ( Chelidonium
majus ) may help improve the efficiency of liver cells.
Milk thistle extract ( Silybum marianum ) may slow dis-
ease progression and significantly improve survival ratesin alcoholics and other cirrhosis patients. Practitioners ofhomeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine can also
prescribe treatments that support healthy liver function.
Prognosis
Cirrhosis-related liver damage cannot be reversed,
but further damage can be prevented by patients who:
• eat properly• get enough rest• do not consume alcohol
• remain free of infection

"• remain free of infection
If the underlying cause of cirrhosis cannot be cor-
rected or removed, scarring will continue. The liver willfail, and the patient will probably die within five years.Patients who stop drinking after being diagnosed withcirrhosis can increase their likelihood of living more thana few years from 40% to 60–70%.

"Prevention
Eliminating alcohol abuse could prevent 75–80% of
all cases of cirrhosis.
Other preventive measures include:
• obtaining counseling or other treatment for alcoholism
• taking precautions (practicing safe sex, avoiding dirty
needles) to prevent hepatitis
• getting immunizations against hepatitis if a person is in
a high-risk group
• receiving appropriate medical treatment quickly when
diagnosed with hepatitis B or hepatitis C
• having blood drawn at regular intervals to rid the body
of excess iron from hemochromatosis
• using medicines (chelating agents) to rid the body of
excess copper from Wilson’s disease
• wearing protective clothing and following product
directions when using toxic chemicals at work, athome, or in the garden

Cleft lip and palate
Definition
A cleft is a birth defect that occurs when the tissues
of the lip and/or palate of the fetus do not fuse very earlyin pregnancy . A cleft lip, sometimes referred to as a
harelip, is an opening in the upper lip that can extend intothe base of the nostril. A cleft palate is an opening in theroof of the mouth.
Description
Babies born with cleft lips will have an opening involv-
ing the upper lip. The length of the opening ranges from asmall notch, to a cleft that extends into the base of the nos-tril. Cleft lips may involve one or both sides of the lip.
Babies born with cleft palates have openings in the"
"Babies born with cleft palates have openings in the
palate, which is the roof of the mouth. The size and posi-tion of the opening varies. The cleft may be only in thehard palate, the bony portion of the roof of the mouth,opening into the floor of the nose. It may be only in thesoft palate, the soft portion of the roof of the mouth. Thecleft palate may involve both the hard and soft palate andmay occur on both sides of the center of the palate.
Babies may have cleft lips with or without cleft
palates. Cleft palates may also occur without cleft lips.
The incidence of cleft lip and palate not associated
with a syndrome is one in 700 newborns. Native Ameri-cans have an incidence of 3.6 in 1,000 newborns. The inci-dence among Japanese newborns is 2.1 in 1,000. The inci-dence among whites is one in 1,000 newborns. AfricanAmericans have an incidence of 0.3 in 1,000 newborns.

"Causes and symptoms
Cleft lips and palates not associated with a syn-
drome are caused by a combination of genetic and envi-ronmental factors. Inheritance caused by such a combi-nation is called multifactorial. The embryo inherits genesthat increase the risk for cleft lip and/or palate. When anembryo with such genes is exposed to certain environ-mental factors the embryo develops a cleft.
The risk of a baby being born with a cleft lip or
palate increases with the number of affected relatives andincreases with relatives that have more severe clefts.
Environmental factors that increase the risk of cleft
lip and palate include cigarette and alcohol use during
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 818Cleft lip and palateGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 818"
"pregnancy. Some drugs also increase the incidence of
clefting, such as phenytoin, sodium valproate, andmethotrexate. The pregnant mother’s nutrition may
affect the incidence of clefting as well.
Babies born with a cleft lip will be seen to have an
elongated opening in the upper lip. The size of this openingmay range from a small notch in the upper lip to an open-ing that extends into the base of the nostril. The cleft lipmay be below the right or left nostril or below both nostrils.
Babies born with a cleft palate will be seen to have
an opening into the roof of the mouth. The size and posi-tion of the cleft varies and it may involve only the hardpalate, or only the soft palate and may occur on bothsides of the center of the palate.
In some cases the cleft palate will be covered with
the normal lining of the mouth and can only be felt bythe examiner.
Babies with cleft lips and palates have feeding diffi-"
"Babies with cleft lips and palates have feeding diffi-
culties, which are more severe in babies with cleftpalates. The difficulty in feeding is due to the baby beingunable to achieve complete suction. In the case of cleftsof the hard palate, liquids enter the nose from the mouththrough the opening in the hard palate.
A cleft palate also affects a child’s speech, since the
palate is necessary for speech formation. The child’sspeech pattern may still be affected despite surgical repair.
Ear infections are more common in babies born with
cleft palates. The infections occur because the muscles ofthe palate do not open the Eustachian tubes which drainthe middle ear. This allows fluid to collect and increasesthe risk of infection and hearing loss .
Teeth may also erupt misaligned.
Diagnosis
Cleft lip and palate can be diagnosed before birth by
ultrasound. After birth, cleft lip and palate are diagnosedby physical exam.
Treatment
If cleft lip and/or palate are diagnosed by ultrasound"
"Treatment
If cleft lip and/or palate are diagnosed by ultrasound
before birth, further testing may be required to diagnoseassociated abnormalities if present. Referral to a cleftteam is essential. A cleft team consists of specialists inthe management of babies with clefts and includes sur-geons as well as nurses and speech therapists. Membersof the team inform the parents of all aspects of manage-ment. Feeding methods are also discussed, since feedingis the first problem that must be dealt with. It may bepossible to breastfeed a baby born with only a cleft lip,but babies born with cleft palates usually have moreproblems with feeding and frequently require special
bottles and teats. A palatal obturator is a device that fitsinto the roof of the mouth, thus blocking the cleft open-ing and allowing easier suckling.
Surgery to repair cleft lips is sometimes performed"
"Surgery to repair cleft lips is sometimes performed
after orthodontic treatment to narrow the gap in the upperlip. The orthodontic treatment can involve acrylic splintswith or without screws or may involve the use of adhesivetape placed across the gap in the lip. The orthodontic treat-ment for cleft lip should be started within the first threeweeks of life and continue until the cleft lip is repaired.
The timing of surgical cleft lip repair depends on the"
"The timing of surgical cleft lip repair depends on the
judgment of the surgeon who will perform the operation.The procedure is usually performed between one andthree months of age. The goals of the operation are toclose the gap in the upper lip, place scars in the naturalskin curves and to repair muscle so that the lip appearsnormal during movement. The closure is done in thethree layers (skin, muscle, and mucosa) that line theinside of the lip. At the time of the procedure, if the noseis shaped abnormally due to the cleft lip, it is also cor-rected. Sometimes further surgery may be needed on thelip and/or nose to refine the result.
The goals of the surgeon repairing a cleft palate are
normal speech, normal facial growth, and hearing for theaffected infant. The repair of the cleft palate is usually per-formed between three and 18 months of age. The timingmay extend beyond this and varies with the type of cleftpalate and center where the procedure is being performed."

"Depending of the type of cleft palate, more than one oper-
ation may be needed to close the cleft and improve speech.
Nonsurgical treatment of a cleft palate is available for
patients who are at high risk for surgery and consists of aprosthetic appliance worn to block the opening in the palate.
Babies born with cleft palates are vulnerable to ear
infections. Their Eustachian tubes do not effectivelydrain fluid from the middle ear so fluid accumulates andinfection sets in. This may lead to hearing loss. Thesechildren require drainage tubes to be inserted to preventfluid accumulation.
Babies born with clefts usually require orthodontic
treatment between 13 and 18 years of age. They alsorequire speech therapy.
Prognosis
Babies born with cleft lip and palate have a good
prognosis, and approximately 80% will develop normalspeech. There is no known means of preventing clefting.Good prenatal care is essential and avoiding harmfulsubstances appear to reduce the risk.

Definition
A clenched fist injury (CFI) is a bite wound on the
hand, caused when a person’s closed fist strikes the teethof another person, usually in the course of a fight. CFIs aresometimes referred to as closed fist injuries or fight bites.
Description
Clenched fist injuries are most common over the
metacarpo phalangeal joint. Their appearance is deceptivebecause they do not bleed heavily and the underlying injuryis hidden by soft tissue when the patient opens his hand andstraightens the injured finger. CFIs can, however, have seri-ous consequences, including infection, cellulitis , inflam-
mation of the bone or bone marrow ( osteomyelitis ), septic"
"mation of the bone or bone marrow ( osteomyelitis ), septic
arthritis, and inflammation of the sheaths covering the ten-dons of the hand (tenosynovitis). These may lead to perma-nent loss of function or amputation .
Most CFIs result in tissue injury due to the force of
impact, ragged-edged tears in the skin resulting fromcontact with the teeth, and contamination of the woundby the bacteria in human saliva. As the patient opens hishand, the skin of the finger is pulled backward over thedeeper part of the wound, thus sealing bacteria within theinjured tissue. This sealing of the wound by normalmotions of the finger is the reason why clenched fistinjuries have the highest rate of infection of any humanbite. The rate of infection of clenched-fist injuries variesfrom 15–50%.
Causes and symptoms
The causes of CFIs include fighting and other forms
of aggressive behavior, often combined with drug oralcohol consumption.
The symptoms of clenched fist injury include pain"
"The symptoms of clenched fist injury include pain
in the affected part of the hand and some stiffness of theinjured finger with limitation of movement. If the patienthas delayed getting medical treatment, there may be evi-dence of infection, including swelling, redness, and sup-puration (a discharge of pus). The skin around the woundwill be warm to the touch and fever may be present.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of clenched fist injuries is usually made
on the basis of the location of the injury and x-ray find-ings. The most common finding in CFI x rays is soft tis-sue swelling, but the x rays may also reveal air pockets indeep tissues or the joint spaces, fragments of teeth, frac-

"ture lines in the bones, or small loose bone chips. Diag-
nosis is often complicated by the fact that the patient willbe reluctant to admit how the injury happened. The treat-ing physician must maintain a high level of suspicion andoften ask directly.
Treatment

"Treatment
Treatment of clenched fist injuries is complicated by
several factors. One factor is the anatomical structure ofthe human hand, which contains many small closedspaces that make it easy for infection to spread and per-sist. Another is the number of disease-causing bacteriatransmitted by human bites; at least 42 different specieshave been identified. In addition, CFIs typically do notreceive immediate treatment because the patient is con-cerned about legal consequences. The longer the delay,the higher the chances of infection and permanent dam-age to the hand. Patients who wait longer than 24 hoursto seek treatment or have signs of infection or damage tothe tendon, joint capsule, or bones are usually referredimmediately to a doctor who specializes in hand surgery.
The first step in treatment of clenched fist injury is irri-"
"The first step in treatment of clenched fist injury is irri-
gation, a procedure by which the wound is flushed with astream of water under high pressure or with an antisepticsolution. Incision and drainage of the wound (I&D) may berequired as well as debridement , the surgical removal of
dead tissue and foreign objects from a wound. Careful
examination of the depth of the wound is essential to prop-er treatment. The surgeon may need to enlarge the sides ofthe wound in order to make an accurate evaluation. Thepatient will be asked to move the affected joint through itsfull range of motion so that the surgeon can determinewhether the tendon or joint capsule has been damaged. Fol-lowing these procedures, the surgeon will pack the woundand put the hand in a splint. Bite wounds are never sutured
(sewn shut) because of the possibility of enclosing bacteriainside the injury. After 24 hours, the packing will beremoved and the hand reexamined for signs of infection."
"If the wound has become infected, the patient is usu-
ally hospitalized and given parenteral (injectable) antibi-
otics . The wound is irrigated and examined to determine
the extent of the injury. Cultures are taken for both aerobic(requiring air or oxygen to live) and anaerobic (not requir-ing air or oxygen) species of bacteria. The cultures shouldbe taken from areas deep in the wound rather than fromthe surface for greater accuracy. Tetanus toxoid should be
given if the patient has not been immunized within the last10 years. The patient should also receive treatment andfollow-up for the rare possibility of HIV and hepatitistransmission. Although no well-documented cases of HIVtransmission by human bites exist as of 2001, the potentialfor transmission by this route is still present.KEY TERMS

Uninfected and relatively superficial CFIs may be treatedwith oral penicillin plus dicloxacillin or Augmentin. Forinfected CFIs, parenteral penicillin G is usually giventogether with nafcillin or cefuroxime. CFIs infected bydrug-resistant strains of S. aureus may require treatment

Prognosis
The prognosis depends on the patient’s underlying
state of health and compliance with treatment; depth ofthe wound; the involvement of the joint capsule or ten-don; and the length of time before the wound is treated.The more superficial the wound and the faster the treat-ment, the better the prognosis.
Prevention
The best way to prevent clenched fist injuries is to
avoid fist fights, intoxication, and association with peo-ple who practice these forms of behavior. If involved in afistfight, people should avoid directing punches at theiropponent’s mouth. The next best preventive measure is toget medical treatment at once for a clenched-fist injury.

Clubfoot
Definition
Clubfoot is a condition in which one or both feet are
twisted into an abnormal position at birth. The conditionis also known as talipes.
Description
True clubfoot is characterized by abnormal bone for-
mation in the foot. There are four variations of clubfoot,including talipes varus, talipes valgus, talipes equines,and talipes calcaneus. In talipes varus, the most commonform of clubfoot, the foot generally turns inward so thatthe leg and foot look somewhat like the letter J. In talipesvalgus, the foot rotates outward like the letter L. In tal-ipes equinus, the foot points downward, similar to that ofa toe dancer. In talipes calcaneus, the foot points upward,with the heel pointing down.Clubfoot can affect one foot or both. Sometimes an"
"infant’s feet appear abnormal at birth because of theintrauterine position of the fetus birth. If there is noanatomic abnormality of the bone, this is not true club-foot, and the problem can usually be corrected by apply-ing special braces or casts to straighten the foot.
The ratio of males to females with clubfoot is 2.5 to
1. The incidence of clubfoot varies only slightly. In theUnited States, the incidence is approximately 1 in every1,000 live births. A 1980 Danish study reported an over-all incidence of 1.20 in every 1,000 children; by 1994,that number had doubled to 2.41 in every 1,000 livebirths. No reason was offered for the increase.

"Causes and symptoms
Experts do not agree on the precise cause of club-
foot. The exact genetic mechanism of inheritance hasbeen extensively investigated using family studies andother epidemiological methods. As of 1999, no definitiveconclusions had been reached, although a Mendelian pat-tern of inheritance is suspected. This may be due to theinteraction of several different inheritance patterns, dif-ferent patterns of development appearing as the samecondition, or a complex interaction between genetic andenvironmental factors. The MSX1 gene has been associ-ated with clubfoot in animal studies. But, as of 2001,these findings have not been replicated in humans.
A family history of clubfoot has been reported in
24.4% of families in a single study. These findings sug-gest the potential role of one or more genes being respon-sible for clubfoot.
Several environmental causes have been proposed"
"Several environmental causes have been proposed
for clubfoot. Obstetricians feel that intrauterine crowd-ing causes clubfoot. This theory is supported by a sig-nificantly higher incidence of clubfoot among twinscompared to singleton births. Intrauterine exposure tothe drug misoprostol has been linked with clubfoot.Misoprostol is commonly used when trying, usuallyunsuccessfully, to induce abortion in Brazil and inother countries in South and Central America.Researchers in Norway have reported that males whoare in the printing trades have significantly more off-spring with clubfoot than men in other occupations.For unknown reasons, amniocentesis , a prenatal test,
has also been associated with clubfoot. The infants ofmothers who smoke during pregnancy have a greater
chance of being born with clubfoot than are offspringof women who do not smoke.

"True clubfoot is usually obvious at birth. The four
most common varieties have been described. A clubfoothas a typical appearance of pointing downward and

"being twisted inwards. Since the condition starts in the
first trimester of pregnancy, the abnormality is quite wellestablished at birth, and the foot is often very rigid.Uncorrected clubfoot in an adult causes only part of thefoot, usually the outer edge, or the heel or the toes, totouch the ground. For a person with clubfoot, walkingbecomes difficult or impossible.
Diagnosis
True clubfoot is usually recognizable and obvious
on physical examination . A routine x ray of the foot that
shows the bones to be malformed or misaligned suppliesa confirmed diagnosis of clubfoot. Ultrasonography isnot always useful in diagnosing the presence of clubfootprior to the birth of a child.

"Treatment
Most orthopedic surgeons agree that the initial treat-
ment of congenital (present at birth) clubfoot should benon-operative. Non-surgical treatment should begin inthe first days of life to take advantage of the favorablefibro-elastic properties of the foot’s connective tissues,those forming the ligaments, joint capsules, and tendons.In a common treatment, a series of casts is applied over aperiod of months to reposition the foot into a normalalignment. In mild cases, splinting and wearing braces atnight may correct the abnormality.
When clubfoot is severe enough to require surgery,"
"When clubfoot is severe enough to require surgery,
the condition is usually not completely correctable,although significant improvement is possible. In the mostsevere cases, surgery may be required, especially whenthe Achilles tendon, which joins the muscles in the calfto the bone of the heel, needs to be lengthened. Becausean early operation induces fibrosis, a scarring and stiff-ness of the tissue, surgery should be delayed until anaffected child is at least three months old.
Much of a clubfoot abnormality can be corrected by"
"Much of a clubfoot abnormality can be corrected by
the use of manipulation and casting during the first threemonths of life. Proper manipulative techniques must befollowed by applications of appropriately molded plastercasts to provide effective and safe correction of mostvarieties of clubfoot. Long-term care by an orthopedist isrequired after initial treatment to ensure that the correc-tion of the abnormality is maintained. Exercises, correc-tive shoes, or nighttime splints may be needed until thechild stops growing.
Prognosis
With prompt, expert treatment, clubfoot is usually
correctable. Most individuals are able to wear regularshoes and lead active lives. If clubfoot is not appropriate-
ly treated, the abnormality becomes fixed. This has aneffect on the growth of the leg and foot, and some degreeof permanent disability usually results.

Cluster headaches are characterized by an intense
one-sided pain centered by the eye or temple. The pain
lasts for one to two hours on average and may recur sev-eral times in a day.

"Description
Cluster headaches have been known as histamine
headaches, red migraines, and Horton’s disease, amongothers. The constant factor is the pain, which transcendsby far the distress of the more common tension-typeheadache or even that of a migraine headache .
Cluster headaches afflict less than 0.5% of the popu-
lation and predominantly affect men; approximately 80%of sufferers are male. Onset typically occurs in the late20s, but there is no absolute age restriction. Approximate-ly 80% of cluster headaches are classified as episodic; theremaining 20% are considered chronic. Both display thesame symptoms. However, episodic cluster headachesoccur during one- to five-month periods followed by six-to 24-month attack-free, or remission, periods. There isno such reprieve for chronic cluster headache sufferers.
Causes and symptoms
Biochemical, hormonal, and vascular changes"
"Causes and symptoms
Biochemical, hormonal, and vascular changes
induce cluster headaches, but why these changes occurremains unclear. Episodic cluster headaches seem to belinked to changes in day length, possibly signaling a con-nection to the so-called biological clock. Alcohol, tobac-co, histamine, or stress can trigger cluster headaches.
Decreased blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia) can also actas a trigger, particularly during the night when an indi-vidual is sleeping. Interestingly, the triggers do not causecluster headaches during remission periods.

"The primary cluster headache symptom is excruciat-
ing one-sided head pain centered behind an eye or nearthe temple. This pain may radiate outward from the ini-tial focus and encompass the mouth and teeth. For thisreason, some cluster headache sufferers may mistakenlyattribute their pain to a dental problem. Secondary symp-toms, occurring on the same side as the pain, include eyetearing, nasal congestion followed by a runny nose, pupilcontraction, and facial drooping or flushing.
Diagnosis
Cluster headache symptoms guide the diagnosis. A
medical examination includes recording headache

"details, such as frequency and duration, when it occurs,
pain intensity and location, possible triggers, and anyprior symptoms. This history allows other potential prob-lems to be discounted.
Treatment
Treatment for cluster headaches is composed of
induction, maintenance, and symptomatic therapies. Thefirst two therapies are prophylactic treatments, gearedtoward preventing headaches. Symptomatic therapy ismeant to stop or shorten a headache.
Induction and maintenance therapies begin together.
Induction therapy is intended to break the headache cyclewith drugs such as corticosteroids (for example, pred-"
"nisone) or dihydroergotamine. These drugs are not meantfor long-term therapy, but rather as a jump-start for main-tenance therapy. Maintenance therapy drugs include ver-apamil, lithium carbonate, ergotamine, and methy-sergide. These drugs have long-term effectiveness, butmust be taken for at least a week before a response isobserved. With long-term treatment, methysergide mustbe stopped for one month each year to avoid dangerousside effects (formation of fibrous tissue inside theabdominal artery, lungs, and heart valves).
Despite prophylactic treatment, headaches may still
occur. Symptomatic therapy includes oxygen inhalation,KEY TERMS

Alternative treatment
Since some cluster headaches are triggered by stress,
stress reduction techniques, such as yoga ,meditation ,
and regular exercise , may be effective. Some cluster
headaches may be an allergic response triggered by food orenvironmental substances, therefore identifying andremoving the allergen(s) may be key to resolution of theproblem. Histamine is another suspected trigger of clusterheadaches, and this response may be controlled with vita-min C and the bioflavonoids quercetin and bromelain(pineapple enzyme). Supplementation with essential fattyacids (EFA) will help decrease any inflammatory response."
"Physical medicine therapies such as adjustments of
the spine, craniosacral treatment, and massage at thetemporomandibular joint (TMJ) can clear blockages, ascan traditional Chinese medical therapies includingacupuncture . Homeopathic treatment can also be bene-
ficial. Nervous system relaxant herbs, used singly or incombination, can allow the central nervous system torelax as well as assist in peripheral nerve response. A fewherbs to consider for relaxation are valerian ( Valeriana
officinalis ), chamomile ( Matricaria recutita ), rosemary
(Rosemarinus officinalis ), and skullcap ( Scutellaria
baicalensis ).
Prognosis
In general, drug therapy offers effective treatment.

Coagulation disorders
Definition
Coagulation disorders deal with disruption of the
body’s ability to control blood clotting. The most com-monly known coagulation disorder is hemophilia , a con-
dition in which patients bleed for long periods of timebefore clotting. There are other coagulation disorderswith a variety of causes.
Description
Coagulation, or clotting, occurs as a complex
process involving several components of the blood. Plas-ma, the fluid component of the blood, carries a numberof proteins and coagulation factors that regulate bleed-ing. Platelets, small colorless fragments in the blood, ini-tiate contraction of damaged blood vessels so that lessblood is lost. They also help plug damaged blood vesselsand work with plasma to accelerate blood clotting. A dis-order affecting platelet production or one of the manysteps in the entire process can disrupt clotting.
Coagulation disorders arise from different causes"
"Coagulation disorders arise from different causes
and produce different complications. Some commoncoagulation disorders are:
• Hemophilia, or hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency),
an inherited coagulation disorder, affects about 20,000Americans. This genetic disorder is carried by femalesbut most often affects males.
• Christmas disease, also known as hemophilia B or Fac-
tor IX deficiency, is less common than hemophilia Awith similar in symptoms.
• Disseminated intravascular coagulation disorder, also
known as consumption coagulopathy, occurs as a resultof other diseases and conditions. This disease acceler-ates clotting, which can actually cause hemorrhage.
•Thrombocytopenia is the most common cause of
coagulation disorder. It is characterized by a lack of cir-culating platelets in the blood. This disease alsoincludes idiopathic thrombocytopenia.
• V on Willebrand’s disease is a hereditary disorder with

"prolonged bleeding time due to a clotting factor defi-
ciency and impaired platelet function. It is the mostcommon hereditary coagulation disorder.
• Hypoprothrombinemia is a congenital deficiency of
clotting factors that can lead to hemorrhage.
• Other coagulation disorders include Factor XI deficien-
cy, also known as hemophilia C, and Factor VII defi-ciency. Hemophilia C afflicts one in 100,000 peopleand is the second most common bleeding disorderamong women. Factor VII is also called serum pro-thrombin conversion accelerator (SPCA) deficiency.One in 500,000 people may be afflicted with this disor-der that is often diagnosed in newborns because ofbleeding into the brain as a result of traumatic delivery.
Causes and symptoms
Some coagulation disorders present symptoms such
as severe bruising. Others will show no apparent symp-toms, but carry the threat of severe internal bleeding.

measures may be required.
Mild and severe hemophilia A are inherited through
a complex genetic system that passes a recessive gene onthe female chromosome. Women usually do not showsigns of hemophilia but are carriers of the disease. Eachmale child of the carrier has a 50% chance of havinghemophilia, and each female child has a 50% chance ofpassing the gene on.

"Christmas disease
Christmas disease, or hemophilia B, is also heredi-
tary but less common than hemophilia A. The severity ofChristmas disease varies from mild to severe, althoughmild cases are more common. The severity depends onthe degree of deficiency of the Factor IX (clotting factor).Hemophilia B symptoms are similar to those of hemo-philia A, including numerous, large, and deep bruisesand prolonged bleeding. The more dangerous symptomsare those that represent possible internal bleeding, suchas swelling of joints, or bleeding into internal organsupon trauma. Hemophilia most often occurs in familieswith a known history of the disease, but occasionally,new cases will occur in families with no apparent history.

malfunction of clotting factors cause platelets to clot insmall blood vessels throughout the body. This action leadsto a lack of clotting factors and platelets at a site of injurythat requires clotting. Patients with disseminated intravas-cular coagulation (DIC) will bleed abnormally eventhough there is no history of coagulation abnormality.Symptoms may include minute spots of hemorrhage onthe skin, and purple patches or hematomas caused bybleeding in the skin. A patient may bleed from surgery orintravenous injection (IV) sites. Related symptoms includevomiting, seizures, coma ,shortness of breath ,shock ,
severe pain in the back, muscles, abdomen, or chest.

"tors. Severe head trauma can expose blood to brain tissue.
No matter the cause of DIC, the results are a malfunctionof thrombin (an enzyme) and prothrombin (a glycopro-tein), which activate the fibrinolytic system, releasingclotting factors in the blood. DIC can alternate from hem-orrhage to thrombosis, and both can exist, which furthercomplicates diagnosis and treatment.
Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia may be acquired or congenital. It
represents a defective or decreased production ofplatelets. Symptoms include sudden onset of small spotsof hemorrhage on the skin, or bleeding into mucousmembranes (such as nosebleeds). The disorder may alsobe evident as blood in vomit or stools, bleeding duringsurgery, or heavy menstrual flow in women. Somepatients show none of these symptoms, but complain offatigue and general weakness. There are several causes"
"of thrombocytopenia, which is more commonly acquiredas a result of another disorder. Common underlying dis-orders include leukemia, drug toxicity, or aplastic ane-

"mia, all of which lead to decreased or defective produc-
tion of platelets in the bone marrow. Other diseases maydestroy platelets outside the marrow. These includesevere infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation,and cirrhosis of the liver. The idiopathic form most com-
monly occurs in children, and is most likely the result ofproduction of antibodies that cause destruction ofplatelets in the spleen and to a lesser extent the liver.
V on Willebrand’s disease is caused by a defect in the
V on Willebrand clotting factor, often accompanied by adeficiency of Factor VIII as well. It is a hereditary disor-der that affects both males and females. In rare cases, itmay be acquired. Symptoms include easy bruising, bleed-ing in small cuts that stops and starts, abnormal bleedingafter surgery, and abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding.Nosebleeds and blood in the stool with a black, tarlikeappearance are also signs of V on Willebrand’s disease.

"Hypoprothrombinemia
This disorder is a deficiency in prothrombin, or Factor
II, a glycoprotein formed and stored in the liver. Prothrom-bin, under the right conditions, is converted to thrombin,which activates fibrin and begins the process of coagula-tion. Some patients may show no symptoms, and otherswill suffer severe hemorrhaging. Patients may experienceeasy bruising, profuse nosebleeds, postpartum hemorrhage,excessively prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, andpostsurgical hemorrhage. Hypoprothrombinemia may alsobe acquired rather than inherited, and usually results from aVitamin K deficiency caused by liver diseases, newborn

Factor XI deficiency, or hemophilia C, occurs more
frequently among certain ethnic groups, with an incidenceof about one in 10,000 among Ashkenazi Jews. Nearly50% of patients with this disorder experience no symp-toms, but others may notice blood in their urine, nose-bleeds, or bruising. Although joint bleeding seldom occurs,some factor XI patients will experience bleeding long afteran injury occurs. Some women will experience prolongedbleeding after childbirth . Patients with factor VII deficien-
cy vary greatly in their bleeding severity. Women mayexperience heavy menstrual bleeding, bleeding from thegums or nose, bleeding deep within the skin, and episodesof bleeding into the stomach, intestine, and urinary tract.Factor VII patients may also suffer bleeding into joints.

"Diagnosis
Several blood tests can be used to detect various
coagulation disorders. There are hundreds of differenttests a doctor can order to look for indications of specificdiseases. In addition to blood tests, physicians will com-
plete a medical history and physical examination . In the
case of acquired coagulation disorders, information suchas prior or current diseases and medications will beimportant in determining the cause of the blood disorder.
• Hemohilia A will be diagnosed with laboratory tests
detecting presence of clotting factor VIII, factor IX, andothers, as well as the presence or absence of clottingfactor inhibitors.
• Christmas disease will be checked against normal
bleeding and clotting time, as well as for abnormalserum reagents in factor IX deficiency. Other tests ofprothrombin time and thromboplastic generation may
also be ordered.
• There is no one test or group of tests that can always"
"also be ordered.
• There is no one test or group of tests that can always
make (or exclude) a diagnosis of DIC. DIC can be diag-nosed through a number of laboratory tests which mea-sure concentration of platelets and fibrinogen in theblood with normal counts and prolonged prothrombintime. Other supportive data include diminished levelsof factors V , fibrinogen, and VIII, decreased hemoglo-bin, and others. Since many of the test results also indi-cate other disorders, the physician may have to puttogether several results to reach a diagnosis of DIC.Serial tests may also be recommended, because a singleexamine at one moment in time may not reveal theprocess that is occurring.
• Tests for thrombocytopenia include coagulation tests
revealing a decreased platelet count , prolonged bleed-
ing time, and other measurements. If these tests indi-cate that platelet destruction is causing the disorder, thephysician may order bone marrow examination."
"• V on Willebrand’s disease will be diagnosed with the
assistance of laboratory tests which show prolongedbleeding time, absent or reduced levels of factor VIII,normal platelet count, and others.
• Hypothrombinemia is diagnosed with history informa-
tion and the use of tests that measure vitamin K defi-ciency, deficiency of prothrombin, and clotting factorsV , VII, IX, and X.
• Factor XI deficiency is diagnosed most often after
injury-related bleeding. Blood tests can help pinpointfactor VII deficiency.
Treatment
In mild cases, treatment may involve the use of
drugs that stimulate the release of deficient clotting fac-tors. In severe cases, bleeding may only stop if the clot-ting factor that is missing is replaced through infusion ofdonated human blood in the form of fresh frozen plasmaor cryoprecipitate.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 828Coagulation disordersGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 828"
"• Hemophilia A in mild episodes may require infusion of
a drug called desmopressin or DDA VP. Severe bleedingepisodes will require transfusions of human blood clot-ting factors. Hemophiliacs are encouraged to receivephysical therapy to help damaged joints and to exercise
in non-contact sports such as swimming, bicycle riding,or walking.
• Christmas disease patients are treated similarly to
hemophilia A patients. There are commercial productsand human blood products available to provide coagu-lation. Cryoprecipitate was invented in 1965 to replacethe need for whole plasma transfusions, which intro-duced more volume than needed. By the 1970s, peoplewere able to infuse themselves with freeze-dried clot-ting factor. Superficial wounds can be cleaned and ban-
daged. Parents of hemophiliac children receivingimmunizations should inform the vaccination provider"
"in advance to decrease the possibility of bleeding prob-lems. These children should probably not receive injec-tions which go into the muscle.
• Treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation
patients is complicated by the large variety of underly-ing causes of the disorder. If at all possible, the physi-cian will first treat this underlying disorder. If thepatient is not already bleeding, this supportive treat-ment may eliminate the DIC. However, if bleeding isoccurring, the patient may need blood, platelets, freshfrozen plasma, or other blood products. Heparin hasbeen controversial in treating DIC, but it is often usedas a last resort to stop hemorrhage. Heparin has notproven useful in treating patients with DIC resultingfrom heat stroke , exotic snakebites, trauma, mis-
matched transfusions, and acute problems resultingfrom obstetrical complications.
• Secondary acquired thrombocytopenia is best alleviated"
"• Secondary acquired thrombocytopenia is best alleviated
by treating the underlying cause or disorder. The specif-ic treatment may depend on the underlying cause.Sometimes, cortocoosterids or immune globulin maybe given to improve platelet production.
• V on Willebrand’s disease is treated by several methods
to reduce bleeding time and to replace factor VIII,which consequently will replace the V on Willebrandfactor. This may include infusion of cryoprecipitate orfresh frozen plasma. Desmopressin may also help raiselevels of the V on Willebrand factor.
• Hypoprothrombinemia may be treated with concen-
trates of prothrombin. Vitamin K may also be produced,and in bleeding episodes, the patient may receive freshplasma products.
• Factor XI (hemophilia C) is most often treated with
plasma, since there are no commercially available con-centrates of factor XI in the United States. Factor VIIpatients may be treated with prothrombin complex con-"
"centrates. As of early 1998, factor VII concentrate wasnot licensed in the United States and could only be usedwith special permission.
Alternative treatment
This can be a very severe condition and should be
managed by a practitioner of alternative medicine in con-junction with a medical doctor; this condition should notbe self managed. For patients known to suffer from hemo-philia A or B and other bleeding disorders, avoidance ofactivities that can cause severe injury should be practiced.Comprehensive care addresses the whole person by help-ing to deal with the psychosocial aspects of the disease.

"Prognosis
The prognosis for patients with mild forms of coag-
ulation disorders is normally good. Many people canlead a normal life and maintain a normal life expectancy.Without treatment of bleeding episodes, severe muscleand joint pain, and eventually, damage, can occur. Anyincident that causes blood to collect in the head, neck, ordigestive system can be very serious and requires imme-diate attention. DIC can be severe enough to cause clotsto form and a stroke could occur. DIC is also seriousenough to cause gangrene in the fingers, nose, or geni-
tals. The prognosis depends on early intervention andtreatment of the underlying condition. Hemorrhage froma coagulation disorder, particularly into the brain ordigestive track, can prove fatal. In the past, patients whoreceived regular transfusions of human blood productswere subject to increased risk of AIDS and other dis-
eases. However, efforts have been made since the early1990s to ensure the safety of the blood supply.
Prevention"
"Prevention
Prevention of coagulation disorders varies. Acquired
disorders may only be prevented by preventing onset of theunderlying disorder (such as cirrhosis). Hereditary disor-ders can be predicted with prenatal testing and genetic
counseling . Prevention of severe bleeding episodes may be
accomplished by refraining from activities that could causeinjury, such as contact sports. Open communication withhealthcare providers prior to procedures or tests that couldcause bleeding may prevent a severe bleeding incident.

Coarctation of the aorta
Definition
A defect that develops in the fetus in which there is a
narrowing of the aortic arch, the main blood artery thatdelivers blood from the left ventricle of the heart to the restof the body. Coarctation of the aorta is diagnosed in bothnewborns and adults. Approximately 10% of newborns withcongenital heart disease have coarctation of the aorta.
Description
Blood leaves the heart by way of the left ventricle"
"Description
Blood leaves the heart by way of the left ventricle
and is distributed to the body by arteries. The aortic archis the first artery to carry blood as it leaves the heart.Other arteries to the head and arms branch off the aorticarch. A narrowing of the aorta at any spot produces resis-tance to the flow of blood. This causes high blood pres-sure before the narrowing and low pressure below the nar-rowing (downstream). Parts of the body supplied by arter-ies that branch off the aortic arch before the narrowinghave high blood pressure, while most of the lower bodydoesn’t receive enough blood supply. To compensate forthis, the heart works harder, and the blood pressure rises.
Approximately half of all infants with coarctation of
the aorta are diagnosed within the first two months oflife. Frequently, there are other congenital cardiac com-plications present. Infants with Turner syndrome have a"
"45% rate of also having coarctation. There is evidencethat some cases of coarctation may be inherited.
Causes and symptoms
In newborns with congenital heart disease, coarcta-
tion of the aorta develops while the baby is in the womb.Among the consequences of coarctation of the aorta isventricular hypertrophy, an enlarging of the left ventriclein response to the increased back pressure of the bloodand the demand for more blood by the body. Symptomsin infants include shortness of breath (dyspnea), diffi-
culty in feeding, and poor weight gain. Older childrenusually don’t have symptoms, but may display fatigue ,
shortness of breath, or a feeling of lameness in their legs.

"Infants usually have an abnormal “gallop” heart
rhythm and may also have heart murmurs . Sometimes
excessive arterial pulses can be seen in the carotid andsuprasternal notch arteries, indicating increased pressurein these arteries, while the femoral pulse is weak or can’tbe detected. The systolic pressure is higher in the armsthan in the legs. Enlargement of the heart can be seen in xrays. Similar symptoms are seen in older children andadults. A 10 mm Hg (mercury) pressure differencebetween the upper and lower extremities is diagnostic forcoarctation of the aorta. For some patients, the systolicpressure difference is observed only during exercise .
Infants frequently have an abnormal electrocardiogram(ECG) that indicates that the right or both ventricles areenlarged, while in older children the ECG may be normalor show that the left ventricle is enlarged. The coarctationmay be detected in echocardiographic examination.

Surgery is indicated forinfants that don’t require immediate surgery, but whodevelop severe hypertension during the first severalmonths of life. Patients are advised to avoid vigorousexercise prior to surgical correction of the coarctation.Recoarctation can occur in some patients, even if theyhave had surgery.

dren who have not had surgery are hypertension, aorticrupture, intracranial bleeding, and congestive heart fail-ure. Women who have an uncorrected coarctation of theaorta have a mortality rate of 10% during pregnancy and
a 90% rate of complications.

Cocainemay be mixed with methcathinone (a more recent drug ofabuse, known as “cat,” that is similar to methampheta-mine) to create a “wildcat.” A hollowed-out cigar filledwith a mixture of crack and marijuana is known as a“woolah.” And either cocaine or crack used in conjunc-tion with heroin is called a “speedball.” Cocaine usedtogether with alcohol represents the most common fataltwo-drug combination.
History
Cocaine is one of the oldest known psychoactive
drugs. Coca leaves, the source of cocaine, were used bythe Incas and other inhabitants of the Andean region ofSouth America for thousands of years, both as a stimu-lant and to depress appetite and combat apoxia ( altitude
sickness ).

"sickness ).
Despite the long history of coca leaf use, it was not
until the latter part of the nineteenth century that theactive ingredient of the plant, cocaine hydrochloride, wasfirst extracted from those leaves. The new drug soonbecame a common ingredient in patent medicines andother popular products (including the original formulafor Coca-Cola). This widespread use quickly raised con-cerns about the drug’s negative effects. In the early1900s, several legislative steps were taken to addressthose concerns; the Harrison Act of 1914 banned the useof cocaine and other substances in non-prescription prod-ucts. In the wake of those actions, cocaine use declinedsubstantially.

"The drug culture of the 1960s sparked renewed
interest in cocaine. With the advent of crack in the 1980s,use of the drug had once again become a national prob-lem. Cocaine use declined significantly during the early1990s, but it remains a significant problem and is on theincrease in certain geographic areas and among certainage groups.
Causes and symptoms
As with other forms of addiction , cocaine abuse is
the result of a complex combination of internal andexternal factors. Genetic predisposition, family history,and immediate environment can all affect a person’sprobability of becoming addicted.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 831CocaineGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 831"
"As many as three to four million people are estimat-
ed to be chronic cocaine users. The 1997 NationalHousehold Survey on Drug Abuse reported an estimated600,000 current crack users, showing no significantchange since the late 1980s.
How cocaine affects the brain
Extensive research has been conducted to determine
how cocaine works on the brain and why it is so addictive.Cocaine has been found to affect an area of the brainknown as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which con-nects with the nucleus accumbens, a major pleasure cen-ter. Like other commonly abused addictive drugs,cocaine’s effects are related to the action of the neuro-transmitter dopamine, which carries information betweenneurons. Cocaine interferes with the normal functioningof neurons by blocking the re-uptake of dopamine, whichbuilds up in the synapses and is believed to cause thepleasurable feelings reported by cocaine users.

Cocaine use and pregnancy
The rise in cocaine use as well as the appearance of
crack cocaine in the late 1980s spurred fears about itseffects on the developing fetus and, since then, several"
"research reports have suggested that prenatal cocaine usecould be associated to a wide range of fetal, newborn,and child development problems. According to the TheLindesmith Center-Drug Policy Foundation, many ofthese early reports had methodological flaws, and mostresearchers nowadays propose more cautious conclu-sions concerning prenatal cocaine effects. Much evi-dence would seem to point to the lack of quality prenatalcare and the use of alcohol and tobacco as primary fac-tors in poor fetal development among pregnant cocaineusers. Research sponsored by the National Institute onDrug Abuse (NIDA) and the Albert Einstein MedicalCenter in Philadelphia corroborate the Lindensmith Cen-ter findings in reporting that the lack of quality prenatalcare is associated with undesirable effects often attrib-uted to cocaine exposure such as prematurity , low birth"
"weight, and fetal or infant death. The Center for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) however, reports thatmothers who use cocaine early in pregnancy are five
times as likely to have a baby with a malformation of theurinary tract as mothers who do not use the drug. Thus,cocaine use during pregnancy is assuredly most inadvis-able, especially since it is also often associated with theuse of alcohol known to cause long-term developmentalproblems. Supporting the cocaine-exposed expectingmother so as to discourage cocaine use remains animportant task for all health caregivers.
Diagnosis
Diagnosing cocaine addiction can be difficult.
Many of the signs of short-term cocaine use are notobvious. Since cocaine users often also use other drugs,it may not be easy to distinguish the effects of one drugfrom another.
Cocaine use has been documented in significant"
"Cocaine use has been documented in significant
numbers of eighth graders as well as older teens. Over allage groups, more men than women use the drug. Thehighest rate of cocaine use is found among adults 18 to25 years old.
Medical complications
Cocaine has been linked to several serious health
problems, including:
• arrhythmia
• heart attacks
• chest pain• respiratory failure
• strokes
• seizures
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 832CocaineGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 832"
"Other complications may vary depending on how
the drug is administered. Prolonged snorting, for exam-ple, can irritate the nasal septum, producing nosebleeds,chronic runny nose, and other problems. Intravenoususers face an increased risk of infectious diseases such asHIV/AIDS and hepatitis.
Testing
Drug testing can be useful in diagnosing and treating
cocaine abuse. Urine testing can detect cocaine; besidesproviding an objective alternative to reliance on what apatient says, such tests can also be used as a follow-up totreatment to confirm that the patient has remained drug-free.
Treatment
The last two decades have seen a dramatic rise in the
number of cocaine addicts seeking treatment. But like allforms of drug abuse, cocaine abuse/addiction is a multi-faceted phenomenon involving environmental, social,and familial as well as physiological factors. This greatlycomplicates the challenge of effectively treating cocaineaddiction.
Pharmacological treatments"
"Pharmacological treatments
To date, no medications have been approved specifi-
cally for treating cocaine addiction. But several wereunder development at this writing. Selegeline, deliveredeither via a time-release pill or a transdermal patch,shows promise as a possible anti-cocaine medication.Clinical studies have shown the drug disulfiram (alsoused to treat alcoholics) to be effective in treatingcocaine abusers. In addition, antidepressant medicationsare sometimes used to control the mood swings associat-ed with the early stages of cocaine withdrawal.
Behavioral approaches
A wide range of behavioral interventions have been
successfully used to treat cocaine addiction. Theapproach used must be tailored to the specific needs ofeach individual patient, however.
Contingency management rewards drug abstinence
(confirmed by urine testing) with points or voucherswhich patients can exchange for such things as anevening out or membership in a gym. Cognitive-behav-"
"ioral therapy helps users learn to recognize and avoid
situations most likely to lead to cocaine use and to devel-op healthier ways to cope with stressful situations. Resi-dential programs/therapeutic communities may also behelpful, particularly in more severe cases.

"Prognosis
Because addiction involves so many different factors,
prospects for individual addicts vary widely. However,research has consistently shown that treatment can signifi-cantly reduce both drug abuse and subsequent criminalactivity. The comprehensive Services Research OutcomesStudy (1998) found a 45% drop in cocaine use five yearsafter treatment, compared to use during the five years beforetreatment. The study also found that females generallyrespond better to treatment than males, and older patientstend to reduce their drug use more than younger patients.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 833CocaineGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 833"

programs used in conjunction with other approaches cansignificantly enhance the prospects for a positive out-come. One study of people in outpatient drug-treatmentprograms found that participation in a 12-step programnearly doubled their chances of remaining drug-free.
Prevention
Despite significant variation over time, cocaine
addiction has proven to be a persistent public health prob-lem. Interdiction and source control are expensive andhave failed to eliminate the problem, and some lawenforcement officials are now recommending moreemphasis on demand reduction through education andother measures to address the causes of cocaine addiction.

"immitis . Spores are the tiny, thick-walled structures that
fungi use to reproduce. Coccidioidomycosis exists inthree forms. The acute form produces flu-like symptoms.The chronic form can develop as many as 20 years afterinitial infection and, in the lungs, can produce inflamed,injured areas that can fill with pus (abscesses). Dissemi-nated coccidioidomycosis describes the type of coccid-ioidomycosis that spreads throughout the body affectingmany organ systems and is often fatal.
Description
Coccidioidomycosis is an airborne infection. The
fungus that causes the disease is found in the dry desertsoil of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Cen-tral and South America. Coccidioidomycosis is some-times called San Joaquin fever , valley fever, or desert
fever because of its prevalence in the farming valleys ofCalifornia. Although commonly acquired, overt coccid-ioidomycosis is a rare disease. Chronic infections occurin only one out of every 100,000 people."
"Although anyone can get coccidioidomycosis, farm
laborers, construction workers, and archaeologists whowork where it is dusty are at greater risk to becomeinfected. People of any age can get coccidioidomycosis,but the disease most commonly occurs in the 25–55 agegroup. In its acute form, coccidioidomycosis infects menand women equally.
Chronic and disseminated forms of coccidioidomy-
cosis occur more frequently in men and pregnant women.Although it is not clear why, people of color are 10-20times more likely to develop the disseminated form ofthe disease than caucasians. People who have a weak-ened immune system (immunocompromised), eitherfrom diseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as the result
of medications that suppressed the immune system ( cor-
ticosteroids ,chemotherapy ), are more likely to develop
disseminated coccidioidomycosis.

"Causes and symptoms
When the spores of C. immitis are inhaled, they can
become lodged in the lungs, divide, and cause localizedinflammation. This is known as acute or primary coccid-ioidomycosis. The disease is not spread from one personto another. Approximately 60% of people who are infect-ed exhibit no symptoms (asymptomatic). In the other40%, symptoms appear 10–30 days after exposure.These symptoms include a fever which can reach 104°F(39.5°C), dry cough , chest pains, joint and muscle aches,
headache , and weight loss. About two weeks after the
start of the fever, some people develop a painful red rashor lumps on the lower legs. Symptoms usually disappearwithout treatment in about one month. People who havebeen infected gain partial immunity to reinfection.
The chronic form of coccidioidomycosis normally
occurs after a long latent period of 20 or more years dur-ing which the patient experiences no symptoms of thedisease. In the chronic phase, coccidioidomycosis causes"

"lung abscesses that rupture, spilling pus and fluid into the
lungs, and causing serious damage to the lungs. Thepatient experiences difficulty breathing and has a fever,chest pain , and other signs of pneumonia . Medical treat-
ment is essential for recovery.
In its disseminated form, coccidioidomycosis
spreads to other parts of the body including the liver,bones, skin, brain, heart, and lining around the heart(pericardium). Symptoms include fever, joint pain, lossof appetite, weight loss, night sweats, skin lesions , and
difficulty breathing. Also, in 30–50% of patients withdisseminated coccidioidomycosis, the tissue coverings ofthe brain and spinal cord become inflamed ( meningitis ).
Diagnosis
Many cases of coccidioidomycosis go undiagnosed
because the symptoms resemble those of common viraldiseases. However, a skin test similar to that for tubercu-
losis will determine whether a person has been infected."
"losis will determine whether a person has been infected.
The test is simple and accurate, but it does not indicatewhether the disease was limited to its acute form or if ithas progressed to its chronic form.
Diagnosis of chronic or disseminated coccidioidomy-
cosis is made by culturing a sample of sputum or otherbody fluids in the laboratory to isolate the fungus. A bloodserum test is used to detect the presence of an antibody pro-duced in response to C. immitis infection. Chest x rays are
often used to assess lung damage, but alone cannot lead toa definitive diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis because otherdiseases can produce similar results on the x ray.
Treatment
In most cases of acute coccidioidomycosis, the
body’s own immune system is adequate to bring aboutrecovery without medical intervention. Fever and paincan be treated with non-prescription drugs.
Chronic and disseminated coccidioidomycosis, how-"
"Chronic and disseminated coccidioidomycosis, how-
ever, are serious diseases that require treatment with pre-scription drugs. Patients with intact immune systems whodevelop chronic coccidiodomycosis are treated with thedrug ketoconazole (Nizoral) or amphotericin B (Fungi-zone). Patients with suppressed immune systems are treat-ed with amphotericin B (Fungizone). Amphotericin B is apowerful fungistatic drug with potentially toxic sideeffects. As a result, hospitalization is required in order tomonitor patients. The patient may also receive other drugsto minimize the side effects of the amphotericin B.
Patients with AIDS must continue to take itracona-

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatment for fungal infections focuses
on creating an internal environment where the funguscannot survive. This is accomplished by eating a diet lowin dairy products, sugars, including honey and fruit juice,and foods like beer that contain yeast. This is comple-mented by a diet consisting, in large part, of uncookedand unprocessed foods. Supplements of vitamins C, E,

Most people who are infected with coccidiodomycosis
only suffer from the mild, acute form of the disease andrecover without further complications. Patients who sufferfrom chronic coccidiodomycosis and who have no underly-ing lung or immune system diseases also stand a goodchange of recovery, although they must be alert to a relapse.

the disease, many of whom have AIDS, is less positive.Untreated disseminated coccidiodomycosis is almostalways fatal within a short time. With treatment, chance ofsurvival increases, but the death rate remains high when

Because the fungus that causes coccidioidomycosis
is airborne and microscopic, the only method of preven-tion is to avoid visiting areas where it is found in the soil.Unfortunately, for many people this is impractical. Main-taining general good health and avoiding HIV infectionwill limit coccidioidomycosis to the acute and relativelymild form in most people.

"Description
The coccyx consists of fused vertebrae, which are
not flexible like the other vertebrae of the vertebral col-umn which are all interspaced by intervertebral disks andjoined together by elastic ligaments. Since the spinalcord ends just before the coccyx begins, coccygeal verte-brae also lack a central foramen (hole). In the coccyx, thevertebrae generally fuse together in early adulthood andmay also fuse with the sacrum, the bone located betweenthe 5th lumbar vertebra and the coccyx, as a person ages.In males, the coccyx curves downward, and in females, itis straighter to allow a baby to pass through the birthcanal without impediment.
Pain in or around the coccyx is called coccydynia or
coccygodynia. Coccydynia presents a range of symptomsassociated to a variety of underlying causes and conditions.

"Causes and symptoms
Causes
Coccydynia can be caused by a number of factors.
Usually, patients report pain after a fall onto their but-tocks, as occurs when going down stairs or while skating.Others have pain during pregnancy or after childbirth .
Some experience repetitive strain from rowing or cycling,and some cite anal intercourse as the cause of pain. Inmany cases, pain derives from a malformation of the coc-cyx itself. Sometimes bony spurs appear on the coccyx,but only seem to be painful in thin patients who do nothave the padding to protect the region from the spur.
Other causes of coccydynia include cancer or dam-

Some patientswill experience pain during bowel movements, sexualintercourse, or menstruation.
Secondary symptoms include back pain from sitting

Cochlear implants
Definition
A cochlear implant is a surgical treatment for hear-
ing loss that works like an artificial human cochlea in the
inner ear, helping to send sound from the ear to the brain.It is different from a hearing aid, which simply amplifiessound.
Purpose
A cochlear implant bypasses damaged hair cells and
helps establish some degree of hearing by stimulating thehearing (auditory) nerve directly.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 837Cochlear implantsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 837"
"Precautions
Because the implants are controversial, very expen-
sive, and have uncertain results, the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) has limited the implants to people:
• who get no significant benefit from hearing aids
• who are at least 2 years old (the age at which specialists
can verify severity of deafness)
• with severe to profound hearing loss.
Description
Hearing loss is caused by a number of different
problems that occur either in the hearing nerve or parts ofthe middle or inner ear. The most common type of deaf-ness is caused by damaged hair cells in the cochlea, thehearing part of the inner ear. Normally, hair cells stimu-late the hearing nerve, which transmits sound signals tothe brain. When hair cells stop functioning, the hearingnerve remains unstimulated, and the person can’t hear.Hair cells can be destroyed by many things, includinginfection, trauma, loud noise, aging , or birth defects .
All cochlear implants consist of a microphone"
"All cochlear implants consist of a microphone
worn behind the ear that picks up sound and sends italong a wire to a speech processor, which is worn in asmall shoulder pouch, pocket, or belt. The processorboosts the sound, filters out background noise, andturns sound into digital signals before sending it to atransmitter worn behind the ear. A magnet holds thetransmitter in place through its attraction to thereceiver-stimulator, a part of the device that is surgical-ly attached beneath the skin in the skull. The receiverpicks up digital signs forwarded by the transmitter, andconverts them into electrical impulses. These electricalimpulses flow through electrodes contained in a narrow,flexible tube that has been threaded into the cochlea.As many as 24 electrodes (depending on the type of
implant) carry the impulses that stimulate the hearingnerve. The brain then interprets the signals as specificsounds.
Despite the benefits that the implant appears to offer,"
"Despite the benefits that the implant appears to offer,
some hearing specialists and members of the deaf com-munity still believe that the benefits may not outweighthe risks and limitations of the device. Because thedevice must be surgically implanted, it carries some sur-gical risk. Also, manufacturers can’t promise how well aperson will hear with an implant. Moreover, after gettingan implant, some people say they feel alienated from theDeaf community, while at the same time not feeling fullya part of the hearing world.
The sounds heard through an implant are different
from the normal hearing sounds, and have beendescribed as artificial or “robotlike.” This is because theimplant’s handful of electrodes cannot hope to match thecomplexity of a person’s 15,000 hair cells.
Surgical procedure
During the procedure, the surgeon makes an incision"
"Surgical procedure
During the procedure, the surgeon makes an incision
behind the ear and opens the mastoid bone (the ridge onthe skull behind the ear) leading into the middle ear. Thesurgeon then places the receiver-stimulator in the bone,and gently threads the electrodes into the cochlea. Thisoperation takes between one and one-half to five hours.
Preparation
Before a person gets an implant, specialists at an

Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict who will
benefit from an implant. In general, the later in life a per-son becomes deaf, and the shorter the duration of deaf-ness, the better the person is likely to understand speechwith an implant. Likewise,someone with a healthy hearingnerve will do better than someone with a damaged nerve.

to be fitted with the external parts of the device (thespeech processor, microphone, and transmitter). A clini-cican tunes the speech processor and sets levels of stimu-lation for each electrode, from soft to loud.
The patient is then trained in how to interpret the
sounds heard through the device. The length of the train-ing varies from days to years, depending on how well theperson can interpret the sounds heard through the device.
Risks
As with all operations, there are a few risks of
surgery. These include:
• dizziness
• facial paralysis (rarely)
• infection at the incision site
Scientists aren’t sure about the long-term effects of
electrical stimulation on the nervous system. It is alsopossible to damage the implant’s internal componentsby a blow to the head, which will render the deviceunworkable.

"Normal results
Most profoundly, deaf patients who receive an
implant are able to discern medium and loud sounds,including speech, at comfortable listening levels. Manyuse sound clues from the implant, together with speechreading and other facial cues. Almost all adults improvetheir communication skills when combining the implantwith speech reading (lip reading), and some can under-stand spoken words without speech reading. More thanhalf of adults who lost hearing after they learned to speakcan understand some speech without speech reading.About 30% can understand spoken sounds well enoughto use the phone.
Children who were born deaf or who lost their hear-
ing before they could speak have the most difficulty inlearning to use the implant. Research suggests, however,that most of these children are able to learn spoken lan-guage and understand speech using the implant.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an action-oriented
form of psychosocial therapy that assumes that maladap-

"tive, or faulty, thinking patterns cause maladaptive
behavior and “negative” emotions. (Maladaptive behav-ior is behavior that is counter-productive or interfereswith everyday living.) The treatment focuses on chang-ing an individual’s thoughts (cognitive patterns) in orderto change his or her behavior and emotional state.
Purpose
Theoretically, cognitive-behavioral therapy can be
employed in any situation in which there is a pattern ofunwanted behavior accompanied by distress and impair-ment. It is a recommended treatment option for a numberof mental disorders, including affective (mood) disor-ders, personality disorders , social phobia, obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders, substance
abuse, anxiety or panic disorder ,agoraphobia ,post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is also fre-
quently used as a tool to deal with chronic pain for
patients with illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis ,"
"patients with illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis ,
back problems, and cancer . Patients with sleep disor-
ders may also find cognitive-behavioral therapy a useful
treatment for insomnia .
Precautions
Cognitive-behavioral therapy may not be suitable for
some patients. Those who don’t have a specific behav-ioral issue they wish to address and whose goals for ther-apy are to gain insight into the past may be better servedby psychodynamic therapy. Patients must also be willingto take a very active role in the treatment process.
Cognitive-behavioral intervention may be inappro-
priate for some severely psychotic patients and for cogni-tively impaired patients (for example, patients withorganic brain disease or a traumatic brain injury),depending on their level of functioning.
Description
Cognitive-behavioral therapy combines the individ-
ual goals of cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy.
Pioneered by psychologists Aaron Beck and Albert"
"Pioneered by psychologists Aaron Beck and Albert
Ellis in the 1960s, cognitive therapy assumes that mal-adaptive behaviors and disturbed mood or emotions arethe result of inappropriate or irrational thinking patterns,called automatic thoughts. Instead of reacting to the real-
ity of a situation, an individual reacts to his or her owndistorted viewpoint of the situation. For example, a per-son may conclude that he is “worthless” simply becausehe failed an exam or didn’t get a date. Cognitive thera-pists attempt to make their patients aware of these dis-torted thinking patterns, or cognitive distortions, and
change them (a process termed cognitive restructuring).
Behavioral therapy, or behavior modification, trains"
"Behavioral therapy, or behavior modification, trains
individuals to replace undesirable behaviors with healthi-er behavioral patterns. Unlike psychodynamic therapies,it does not focus on uncovering or understanding theunconscious motivations that may be behind the maladap-tive behavior. In other words, strictly behavioral therapistsdon’t try to find out why their patients behave the waythey do, they just teach them to change the behavior.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy integrates the cogni-"
"Cognitive-behavioral therapy integrates the cogni-
tive restructuring approach of cognitive therapy with thebehavioral modification techniques of behavioral thera-py. The therapist works with the patient to identify boththe thoughts and the behaviors that are causing distress,and to change those thoughts in order to readjust thebehavior. In some cases, the patient may have certainfundamental core beliefs, called schemas, which areflawed and require modification. For example, a patientsuffering from depression may be avoiding social contactwith others, and suffering considerable emotional dis-tress because of his isolation . When questioned why, the"
"patient reveals to his therapist that he is afraid of rejec-tion, of what others may do or say to him. Upon furtherexploration with his therapist, they discover that his realfear is not rejection, but the belief that he is hopelesslyuninteresting and unlovable. His therapist then tests thereality of that assertion by having the patient namefriends and family who love him and enjoy his company.By showing the patient that others value him, the thera-pist both exposes the irrationality of the patient’s beliefand provides him with a new model of thought to changehis old behavior pattern. In this case, the person learns tothink, “I am an interesting and lovable person; therefore Ishould not have difficulty making new friends in socialsituations.” If enough “irrational cognitions” arechanged, this patient may experience considerable relieffrom his depression.
A number of different techniques may be employed"
"A number of different techniques may be employed
in cognitive-behavioral therapy to help patients uncoverand examine their thoughts and change their behaviors.They include:
• Behavioral homework assignments. Cognitive-behav-
ioral therapists frequently request that their patientscomplete homework assignments between therapy ses-sions. These may consist of real-life “behavioral exper-iments” where patients are encouraged to try out newresponses to situations discussed in therapy sessions.
• Cognitive rehearsal. The patient imagines a difficult sit-
uation and the therapist guides him through the step-by-step process of facing and successfully dealing with it.The patient then works on practicing, or rehearsing,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 840Cognitive-behavioral therapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 840"
"these steps mentally. Ideally, when the situation arises
in real life, the patient will draw on the rehearsedbehavior to address it.
• Journal. Patients are asked to keep a detailed diary
recounting their thoughts, feelings, and actions whenspecific situations arise. The journal helps to make thepatient aware of his or her maladaptive thoughts and toshow their consequences on behavior. In later stages oftherapy, it may serve to demonstrate and reinforce posi-tive behaviors.
• Modeling. The therapist and patient engage in role-
playing exercises in which the therapist acts out appro-priate behaviors or responses to situations.
• Conditioning. The therapist uses reinforcement to"
"• Conditioning. The therapist uses reinforcement to
encourage a particular behavior. For example, a childwith ADHD gets a gold star every time he stays focusedon tasks and accomplishes certain daily chores. Thegold star reinforces and increases the desired behaviorby identifying it with something positive. Reinforce-ment can also be used to extinguish unwanted behav-iors by imposing negative consequences.
• Systematic desensitization. Patients imagine a situation"
"they fear, while the therapist employs techniques to helpthe patient relax, helping the person cope with their fearreaction and eventually eliminate the anxiety altogether.For example, a patient in treatment for agoraphobia, orfear of open or public places, will relax and then pictureherself on the sidewalk outside of her house. In her nextsession, she may relax herself and then imagine a visit toa crowded shopping mall. The imagery of the anxiety-producing situations gets progressively more intenseuntil, eventually, the therapist and patient approach theanxiety-causing situation in real-life (a “graded expo-sure”), perhaps by visiting a mall. Exposure may beincreased to the point of “flooding,” providing maximumexposure to the real situation. By repeatedly pairing adesired response (relaxation) with a fear-producing situa-tion (open, public spaces), the patient gradually becomesdesensitized to the old response of fear and learns toreact with feelings of relaxation."
"• Validity testing. Patients are asked to test the validity of
the automatic thoughts and schemas they encounter.The therapist may ask the patient to defend or produceevidence that a schema is true. If the patient is unable tomeet the challenge, the faulty nature of the schema isexposed.
Initial treatment sessions are typically spent explain-
ing the basic tenets of cognitive-behavioral therapy to thepatient and establishing a positive working relationshipbetween therapist and patient. Cognitive-behavioral thera-py is a collaborative, action-oriented therapy effort. Assuch, it empowers the patient by giving him an active roleKEY TERMS

"in 1955 by psychologist Albert Ellis. REBT is based on
the belief that a person’s past experiences shape theirbelief system and thinking patterns. People form illogi-cal, irrational thinking patterns that become the cause ofboth their negative emotions and of further irrationalideas. REBT focuses on helping patients discover theseirrational beliefs that guide their behavior and replacethem with rational beliefs and thoughts in order to relievetheir emotional distress.
There are 10 basic irrational assumptions that trigger
maladaptive emotions and behaviors:
• It is a necessity for an adult to be loved and approved of
by almost everyone for virtually everything.
• A person must be thoroughly competent, adequate, and
successful in all respects.
• Certain people are bad, wicked, or villainous and
should be punished for their sins.

• Human unhappiness is externally caused. People have
little or no ability to control their sorrows or to ridthemselves of negative feelings.
• It is right to be terribly preoccupied with and upset
about something that may be dangerous or fearsome.
• It is easier to avoid facing many of life’s difficulties and
responsibilities than it is to undertake more rewardingforms of self-discipline.
• The past is all-important. Because something once
strongly affected someone’s life, it should continue todo so indefinitely.
• People and things should be different from the way they
are. It is catastrophic if perfect solutions to the grimrealities of life are not immediately found.

It is based on the belief that an indi-vidual’s actions follow directly from this self-talk. Thistype of therapy emphasizes teaching patients copingskills that they can use in a variety of situations to helpthemselves.

referred for treatment by a primary physician, psycholo-gist, or psychiatrist. Because the patient and therapistwork closely together to achieve specific therapeuticobjectives, it is important that their working relationshipis comfortable and their goals are compatible. Prior tobeginning treatment, the patient and therapist shouldmeet for a consultation session, or mutual interview. Theconsultation gives the therapist the opportunity to makean initial assessment of the patient and recommend acourse of treatment and goals for therapy. It also givesthe patient an opportunity to find out important detailsabout the therapist’s approach to treatment, professionalcredentials, and any other issues of interest.

Normal results
Many patients who undergo cognitive-behavioral
therapy successfully learn how to replace their mal-adaptive thoughts and behaviors with positive ones thatfacilitate individual growth and happiness. Cognitive-behavioral therapy may be used in conjunction withpharmaceutical and other treatment interventions, sooverall success rates are difficult to gauge. However,success rates of 65% or more have been reported withcognitive-behavioral therapy alone as a treatment forpanic attacks and agoraphobia. Relapse has been report-ed in some patient populations, perhaps due to the briefnature of the therapy, but follow-up sessions can putpatients back on track.

Cold agglutinins test
Definition
The cold agglutinins test is performed to detect the
presence of antibodies in blood that are sensitive to tem-perature changes. Antibodies are proteins produced bythe immune system in response to specific diseaseagents; autoantibodies are antibodies that the body pro-duces against one of its own substances. Cold agglutininsare autoantibodies that cause red blood cells to clump,but only when the blood is cooled below the normal bodytemperature of 98.6°F (37°C). The clumping is most pro-nounced at temperatures below 78°F (25.6°C).

"Purpose
The cold agglutinins test is used to confirm the diag-

mononucleosis, mumps ,measles ,scarlet fever , some
parasitic infections, cirrhosis of the liver, and some
types of hemolytic anemia can also cause the formation
of cold agglutinins. Hemolytic anemias are conditions in
which the blood is low in oxygen because the red bloodcells are breaking down at a faster rate than their normallife expectancy of 120 days. In addition to these illness-es, some people have a benign condition called chroniccold agglutinin disease, in which exposure to cold causestemporary clumping of red blood cells and consequentnumbness in ears, fingers, and toes.

Cold sore
Definition
A cold sore is a fluid-filled blister which usually
appears at the edge of the lips. Cold sores are caused by aherpes simplex virus infection.
Description
A cold sore is a fluid-filled, painful blister that is
usually on or around the lips. Other names for a cold soreare fever blister, oral herpes, labial herpes, herpes labi-
alis, and herpes febrilis. Cold sores most often occur onthe lips which distinguishes them from the commoncanker sore, which is usually inside the mouth. Coldsores do not usually occur inside the mouth except dur-ing the initial episode. Canker sores usually form either
on the tongue or inside the cheeks.
Cold sores are caused by a herpes virus. There are"
"on the tongue or inside the cheeks.
Cold sores are caused by a herpes virus. There are
eight different kinds of human herpes viruses. Only twoof these, herpes simplex types 1 and 2, can cause coldsores. It is commonly believed that herpes simplex virustype 1 infects above the waist and herpes simplex virustype 2 infects below the waist. This is not completelytrue. Both herpes virus type 1 and type 2 can cause her-pes lesions on the lips or genitals, but recurrent coldsores are almost always type 1.
Oral herpes is very common. More than 60% of"
"Oral herpes is very common. More than 60% of
Americans have had a cold sore, and almost 25% ofthose infected experience recurrent outbreaks. Most ofthese persons became infected before age 10. Anyonecan become infected by herpes virus and, once infected,the virus remains latent for life. Herpes viruses arespread from person to person by direct skin-to-skin con-tact. The highest risk for spreading the virus is the timeperiod beginning with the appearance of blisters and end-ing with scab formation. However, infected persons neednot have visible blisters to spread the infection to otherssince the virus may be present in the saliva without obvi-ous oral lesions.Viruses are different from bacteria. While bacteria
are independent and can reproduce on their own, virusesenter human cells and force them to make more virus. Theinfected human cell is usually killed and releases thou-sands of new viruses. The cell death and resulting tissue"
"damage causes the actual cold sores. In addition, the her-pes virus can infect a cell and instead of making the cellproduce new viruses, it hides inside the cell and waits.The herpes virus hides in the nervous system. This iscalled “latency.” A latent virus can wait inside the nervoussystem for days, months, or even years. At some futuretime, the virus “awakens” and causes the cell to producethousands of new viruses that cause an active infection.
This process of latency and active infection is best"
"This process of latency and active infection is best
understood by considering the cold sore cycle. An activeinfection is obvious because cold sores are present. Thefirst infection is called the “primary” infection. This activeinfection is then controlled by the body’s immune systemand the sores heal. In between active infections, the virusis latent. At some point in the future, latent viruses becomeactivated and once again cause sores. These are called“recurrent” infections. Although it is unknown what trig-gers latent virus to activate, several conditions seem tobring on infections. These include stress , illness, tired-
ness, exposure to sunlight, menstruation, fever, and diet.

"Causes and symptoms
While anyone can be infected by herpes virus, not
everyone will show symptoms. The first symptoms ofherpes occur within two-20 days after contact with aninfected person. Symptoms of the primary infection areusually more severe than those of recurrent infections.The primary infection can cause symptoms like otherviral infections including tiredness, headache , fever, and
swollen lymph nodes in the neck.
Typically, 50-80% of persons with oral herpes expe-
rience a prodrome (symptoms of oncoming disease) ofpain , burning, itching , or tingling at the site where blis-
ters will form. This prodrome stage may last anywherefrom a few hours to one to two days. The herpes infec-tion prodrome occurs in both the primary infection andrecurrent infections.

"In 95% of the patients with cold sores, the blisters
occur at the outer edge of the lips which is called the“vermilion border.” Less often, blisters form on the nose,chin, or cheek. Following the prodrome, the diseaseprocess is rapid. First, small red bumps appear thatquickly form fluid-filled blisters. The painful blistersmay either burst and form a scab or dry up and form ascab. Within two days of the first red bumps, all the blis-ters have formed scabs. The skin heals completely andwithout scarring within six to ten days.

"Some children have a very serious primary (first
episode) herpes infection called “gingivostomatitis.” Thiscauses fever, swollen lymph glands, and numerous blis-ters inside the mouth and on the lips and tongue that mayform large, open sores. These painful sores may last upto three weeks and can make eating and drinking diffi-cult. Because of this, young children with gingivostom-atitis are at risk for dehydration (excessive loss of water
from the body).
Most people experience fewer than two recurrent
outbreaks of cold sores each year. Some people neverexperience outbreaks, while some have very frequentoutbreaks. In most people, the blisters form in the samearea each time and are triggered by the same factors(such as stress, sun exposure, etc).

"Diagnosis
Because oral herpes is so common, it is diagnosed
primarily by symptoms. It can be diagnosed and treatedby the family doctor, dermatologists (doctors who spe-cialize in skin diseases) and infectious disease special-ists. Laboratory tests may be performed to look for thevirus. Because healing sores do not shed much virus, asample from an open sore would be taken for viral cul-ture. A sterile cotton swab would be wiped over opensores and the sample used to infect human cells in cul-ture. Cells that are killed by the herpes virus have a cer-tain appearance under microscopic examination. Theresults of this test are available within two to 10 days.

"Oral herpes may resemble a bacterial infection called
impetigo. This skin infection is most commonly seen inchildren and causes herpes-like blisters around the mouthand nose. Also, because oral herpes can occur inside themouth, the blisters could be mistaken for common cankersores. Therefore, the doctor would need to determinewhether the blisters are oral herpes, canker sores, orimpetigo . The diagnosis and treatment of herpes infec-
tions should be covered by most insurance providers.

"are antiviral drugs available that have some effect on
lessening the symptoms and decreasing the length of her-pes outbreaks. There is evidence that some may also pre-vent future outbreaks. These antiviral drugs work byinterfering with the replication of the viruses, and aremost effective when taken as early in the infectionprocess as possible. For the best results, drug treatmentshould begin during the prodrome stage before blistersare visible. Depending on the length of the outbreak,drug treatment could continue for up to 10 days.Acyclovir (Zovirax) is the drug of choice for herpes
infection and can be given intravenously or taken bymouth. It can be applied directly to sores as an ointmentbut is not very useful in this form. A liquid form for chil-dren is also available. Acyclovir is effective in treatingboth the primary infection and recurrent outbreaks.When taken by mouth to prevent an outbreak, acyclovirreduces the frequency of herpes outbreaks."
"During an outbreak of cold sores, salty foods, citrus
foods (oranges etc.), and other foods that irritate the soresshould be avoided. Wash the sores once or twice a daywith warm, soapy water and pat gently to dry. Over-the-counter lip products that contain the chemical phenol(such as Blistex Medicated Lip Ointment) and numbingointments (Anbesol) help to relieve cold sores. A bandagemay be placed over the sores to protect them and preventspreading the virus to other sites on the lips or face.Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)
may be taken if necessary to reduce pain and fever.
Alternative treatment
Vitamin and mineral supplements and diet may have
an effect on the recurrence and duration of cold sores. Ingeneral, cold sore sufferers should eat a healthy diet ofunprocessed foods such as vegetables, fruits, and wholegrains. Alcohol, caffeine , and sugar should be avoided.
An imbalance in the amino acids lysine and arginine"
"An imbalance in the amino acids lysine and arginine
is thought to be one contributing factor in herpes virus out-breaks. A diet that is rich in the amino acid lysine mayhelp prevent recurrences of cold sores. Foods which con-tain high levels of lysine include most vegetables,legumes, fish, turkey, and chicken.

1,000 mg of lysine three times a day during a cold soreoutbreak and 500 mg daily on an ongoing basis to preventrecurrences. Intake of the amino acid arginine should bereduced. Foods rich in arginine that should be avoided arechocolate, peanuts, almonds, and other nuts and seeds.
Vitamin C and bioflavonoids (a substance in fruits
that helps the body to absorb and use vitamin C) havebeen shown to reduce the duration of a cold sore outbreakand reduce the number of sores. The vitamin B complexincludes important vitamins that support the nervous sys-"
"tem where viruses can hide out. B complex vitamins canalso help manage stress, an important contributing factorto the outbreak of herpes viruses. Applying the oil in vita-min E capsules directly to cold sores may provide relief.Zinc lozenges appear to affect the reproduction of virusesand also enhance the immune system. Ointments contain-ing lemon balm ( Melissa officinalis ) or licorice ( Gly-
cyrrhiza glabra ) and peppermint ( Mentha piperita ) have
been shown to help cold sores heal.
Prognosis
Oral herpes can be painful and embarrassing, but it
is not a serious infection. There is no cure for oral herpes,but outbreaks usually occur less frequently after age 35.The spread of the herpes virus to the eyes is very serious.The herpes virus can infect the cells in the cornea andcause scarring that may impair vision.

"Prevention
The only way to prevent oral herpes is to avoid con-
tact with infected persons. This is not an easy solutionbecause many people aren’t aware that they are infectedand can easily infect others. Currently there are no her-pes vaccines available, although herpes vaccines arebeing tested.KEY TERMS
Latent —A nonactive virus which is in a dormant
state within a cell. The herpes virus is latent in thenervous system.
Prodrome —The Symptoms that warn of the begin-
ning of disease. The herpes prodrome consists ofpain, burning, tingling, or itching at a site beforeblisters are visible.
Recurrence —The return of an active infection fol-

sores and the spread of virus to other body locations orpeople. These practices are:
• Avoidance of sun exposure to the face. Before getting
prolonged exposure to the sun, apply sunscreen to theface and especially to the lips. Wearing a hat with alarge brim is also helpful."
"• Avoid touching cold sores. Squeezing, picking, or
pinching blisters can allow the virus to spread to otherparts of the lips or face and infect those sites.
• Wash hands frequently. Persons with oral herpes should
wash their hands carefully before touching others. Aninfected person can spread the virus to others evenwhen he or she has no obvious blisters.
• Avoid contact with others during active infection.
Infected persons should avoid kissing or sexual contactwith others until after the cold sores have healed.
• Wear gloves when applying ointment to a child’s sore.• Be especially careful with infants. Never kiss the eyes
or lips of a baby who is under six months old.
• Be watchful of infected children. Do not allow infected
children to share toys that may be put into the mouth.Toys that have been mouthed should be disinfectedbefore other children play with them.

"Colic
Definition
Colic is persistent, unexplained crying in a healthy
baby between two weeks and five months of age.
Description
Colic, which is not a disease, affects 10–20% of all
infants. It is more common in boys than in girls and mostcommon in a family’s first child. Symptoms of colic usu-ally appear when a baby is 14–21 days old, reach acrescendo at the age of three months, and disappear with-in the next eight weeks. Episodes occur frequently butintermittently and usually begin with prolonged periodsof crying in the late afternoon or evening. They can lastfor just a few minutes or continue for several hours.Some babies who have colic are simply fussy. Others cryso hard that their faces turn red, then pale.
Causes and symptoms
No one knows what causes colic. The condition may
be the result of swallowing large amounts of air, whichbecomes trapped in the digestive tract and causes bloat-ing and severe abdominal pain .
Other possible causes of colic include:"
"Other possible causes of colic include:
• digestive tract immaturity
• food intolerances
• hunger or overfeeding
• lack of sleep
• loneliness
• overheated milk or formula
• overstimulation resulting from noise, light, or activity
• tension
During a colicky episode, babies’ bellies often look
swollen, feel hard, and make a rumbling sound. Cryingintensifies, tapers off, then gets louder. Many babiesgrow rigid, clench their fists, curl their toes, and drawtheir legs toward their body. A burp or a bowel move-ment can end an attack. Most babies who have colicdon’t seem to be in pain between attacks.
Diagnosis
Pediatricians and family physicians suspect colic in
an infant who:
• has cried loudly for at least three hours a day at least
three times a week for three weeks or longer• is not hungry but cries for several hours between din-
nertime and midnight
• demonstrates the clenched fists, rigidity, and other
physical traits associated with colic"
"• demonstrates the clenched fists, rigidity, and other
physical traits associated with colic
The baby’s medical history and a parent’s descrip-
tion of eating, sleeping, and crying patterns are used toconfirm a diagnosis of colic. Physical examination and
laboratory tests are used to rule out infection, intestinalblockage, and other conditions that can cause abdominalpain and other colic-like symptoms.
Treatment
Medications do not cure colic. Doctors sometimes
recommend simethicone (Mylicon Drops) to relieve gaspain, but generally advise parents to take a practicalapproach to the problem.
Gently massaging the baby’s back can release a
trapped gas bubble, and holding the baby in a sittingposition can help prevent air from being swallowed dur-ing feedings. Bottle-fed babies can swallow air if nippleholes are either too large or too small.
Nipple-hole size can be checked by filling a bottle"
"Nipple-hole size can be checked by filling a bottle
with cold formula, turning it upside down, and countingthe number of drops released when it is shaken orsqueezed. A nipple hole that is the right size will releaseabout one drop of formula every second.
Babies should not be fed every time they cry, but
feeding and burping a baby more often may alleviatesymptoms of colic. A bottle-fed baby should be burpedafter every ounce, and a baby who is breastfeedingshould be burped every five minutes.
When cow’s milk is the source of the symptoms,
bottle-fed babies should be switched to a soy milkhydrolyzed protein formula. A woman whose baby isbreastfeeding should eliminate dairy products from herdiet for seven days, then gradually reintroduce themunless the baby’s symptoms reappear.
Since intolerance to foods other than cow’s milk may
also lead to symptoms of colic, breastfeeding women mayalso relieve their babies’ colic by eliminating from their diet:
• coffee
• tea• cocoa• citrus
• peanuts"

"Rocking a baby in a quiet, darkened room can pre-
vent overstimulation, and a baby usually calms downwhen cuddled in a warm, soft blanket.
Colicky babies cry less when they are soothed by the
motion of a wind-up swing, a car ride, or being carried ina parent’s arms. Pacifiers can soothe babies who areupset, but a pacifier should never be attached to a string.
A doctor should be notified if a baby who has been
diagnosed with colic:
• develops a rectal fever higher than 101°F (38.3°C)
• cries for more than four hours• vomits• has diarrhea or stools that are black or bloody
• loses weight
• eats less than normal
Alternative treatment
Applying gentle pressure to the webbed area
between the thumb and index finger of either hand cancalm a crying child. So can gently massaging the areadirectly above the child’s navel and the correspondingspot on the spine. Applying warm compresses or holdingyour hand firmly over the child’s abdomen can relievecramping."
"Teas made with chamomile ( Matricaria recutita ),
lemon balm ( Melissa officinalis ), peppermint ( Mentha
piperita ), or dill ( Anethum graveolens ) can lessen bowel
inflammation and reduce gas. A homeopathic combina-tion called “colic” may be effective, and constitutionalhomeopathic treatment can help strenthen the child’sentire constitution.
Prognosis
Colic is distressing, but it is not dangerous. Symp-
toms almost always disappear before a child is sixmonths old.
Prevention
Many doctors believe that colic cannot be prevented.
Some alternative practitioners, however, feel that coliccan be prevented by an awareness of food intolerancesand their impact.

Colon cancer
Definition
Cancer of the colon is the disease characterized by
the development of malignant cells in the lining orepithelium of the first and longest portion of the largeintestine. Malignant cells have lost normal control mech-anisms governing growth. These cells may invade sur-rounding local tissue, or they may spread throughout thebody and invade other organ systems.
Synonyms for the colon include the large bowel or"
"Synonyms for the colon include the large bowel or
the large intestine. The rectum is the continuation of thelarge intestine into the pelvis that terminates in the anus.
Description
The colon is a tubular organ beginning in the right
lower aspect of the abdomen. Anatomically, it ascends onthe right side of the abdomen, traverses from right to leftin the upper abdomen, descends vertically down the leftside, takes an S-shaped curve in the lower left abdomen,and then flows into the rectum as it leaves the abdomenfor the pelvis. These portions of the colon are named sep-arately though they are part of the same organ:
• cecum, the beginning of the colon
• ascending colon, the right vertical ascent of the colon• transverse colon, the portion traversing from right to left
• descending colon, the left vertical descent of the colon
• sigmoid colon, the s-shaped segment of colon above the
pelvis
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 848Colon cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 848"
"These portions of the colon are recognized anatomi-
cally based on the arterial blood supply and venous andlymphatic drainage of these segments of the colon.Lymph, a protein-rich fluid that bathes the cells of thebody, is transported in small channels known as lymphat-ics that run along side the veins of the colon. Lymphnodes are small filters through which the lymph travelson its way back to the blood stream. Cancer can spreadelsewhere in the body by invading the lymph and vascu-lar systems. Therefore, these anatomic considerationsbecome very important in the treatment of colon cancer.
The small intestine is the continuation of the upper"
"The small intestine is the continuation of the upper
gastrointestinal tract that is responsible for the transportof ingested nutrients into the body. The waste left afterthe small intestine has completed absorption of nutrientsamounts to a few liters (about the same as quart) of mate-rial per day and is directly delivered to the colon (at thececum) for processing. Physiologically, the colon isresponsible for the preservation of fluid and electrolytesas it propels the increasingly solid waste towards the rec-tum and anus for excretion.
When cells lining the colon become malignant, they"
"When cells lining the colon become malignant, they
first grow locally and may invade partially or totallythrough the wall of the bowel and even into adjacentstructures and organs. In the process, the tumor can pene-trate and invade the lymphatics or the capillaries locallyand it gains access to the circulation. As the malignantcells work their way to other areas of the body, theyagain become locally invasive in the new area to whichthey have spread. These tumor deposits, originating inthe colon primary tumor, are then known as metastases.If metastases are found in the regional lymph nodes fromthe primary, they are known as regional metastases orregional nodal metastases. If they are distant from theprimary tumor, they are known as distant metastases. Thepatient with distant metastases has systemic disease.Thus the cancer originating in the colon begins locallyand, given time, can become systemic in its extent.
By the time the primary is originally detected, it is"
"By the time the primary is originally detected, it is
usually larger than 0.4 in (1 cm) in size and has over amillion cells. This amount of growth itself is estimated totake about three to seven years. Each time the cells dou-ble in number, the size of the tumor quadruples. Thus,like most cancers, the part that is identified clinically islater in the progression than would be desired andscreening becomes a very important endeavor to aid inearlier detection of this disease.
There are about 94,000 cases of colon cancer diag-
nosed per year in the United States. Together, colon andrectal cancers account for 10% of cancers in men and11% of cancers in women. It is the second most com-mon site-specific cancer affecting both men andwomen. (Lung cancer is the first affecting both men and"
"women, breast is the leader in women and prostate theleader in men.) Nearly 48,000 people died from coloncancer in the United States in 2000. In recent years theincidence of this disease is decreasing very slightly, ashas the mortality rate. It is difficult to tell if thedecrease in mortality reflects earlier diagnosis, lessdeath related to the actual treatment of the disease, or a
combination of both factors.
Cancer of the colon is thought to arise sporadically
in about 80% of those who develop the disease. Twentypercent of cases are thought to have genetic predisposi-tion that ranges from familial syndromes affecting 50%of the offspring of a mutation carrier, to a risk of 6%when there is just a family history of colon cancer occur-ring in a first degree relative. Development of colon can-cer at an early age, or at multiple sites, or recurrent coloncancer suggests a genetically transmitted form of the dis-ease as opposed to the sporadic form.
Causes and symptoms"
"Causes and symptoms
Causes of colon cancer are probably environmental
in the sporadic cases (80%) and genetic in the hereditypredisposed cases (20%). Since malignant cells have achanged genetic makeup, this means that in 80% ofcases, the environment spontaneously induces change,whereas in those born with a genetic predisposition, theyare either destined to get the cancer or it will take lessenvironmental exposure to induce the cancer. Exposureto agents in the environment that may induce mutation isthe process of carcinogenesis and is caused by agentsknown as carcinogens (cancer-causing agents). Specificcarcinogens have been difficult to identify; however,dietary factors seem to be involved.
Colon cancer is more common in industrialized
nations and diets high in fat, red meat, total calories, and"
"nations and diets high in fat, red meat, total calories, and
alcohol seem to predispose. Diets high in fiber are asso-ciated with a decreased risk. The mechanism for protec-tion by high-fiber diets may be related to less exposure ofthe colon lining to carcinogens from the environment, asthe transit time through the bowel is faster with a high-fiber diet than it is with a low-fiber diet.
Age plays a definite role in the predisposition to
colon cancer. Colon cancer is uncommon before age 40.This incidence increases substantially after age 50 anddoubles with each succeeding decade.
There is also a slight increase risk for colon cancer
in the individual who smokes.
Patients who suffer from inflammatory diseases of
the colon known as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s colitis
are also at increased risk.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 849Colon cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 849"
"As for genetic predisposition, on chromosome 5,"
"there is a gene called the APC gene associated with thefamilial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. There aremultiple different mutations that occur at this site, yetthey all cause a defect in tumor suppression that resultsin early and frequent development of colon cancer. Thisgenetic aberration is transmitted to 50% of offspring andeach of those affected will develop colon cancer, usuallyat an early age. There is another syndrome, hereditarynon-polyposis colon cancer (also known as Lynch syn-drome), related to mutations in any of four genes respon-sible for DNA mismatch repair. In patients with coloncancer, the p53 gene is mutated 70% of the time. Whenthe p53 gene is mutated and ineffective, cells with dam-aged DNA escape repair or destruction. This allows forthe damaged cell to perpetuate itself, and continuedreplication of the damaged DNA may lead to tumordevelopment. Though these syndromes have a very highincidence of colon cancer, family history without thesyndrome is also a"
"syndromes have a very highincidence of colon cancer, family history without thesyndrome is also a substantial risk factor. When consid-ering first-degree relatives, history of one with colon can-cer raises the baseline risk of 2% to 6%. (Most physi-cians think that this baseline is about 4%.) The presenceof a second raises the risk to 17%."
"The development of polyps of the colon almost
always precedes the development of colon cancer by fiveor more years. Polyps are benign growths of the colonlining. They can be unrelated to cancer, precancerous, ormalignant. Polyps, when identified, are removed fordiagnosis. If the polyps are benign, the patient shouldundergo careful surveillance for the development ofmore polyps or the development of colon cancer.
Colon cancer causes symptoms related to its local
presence in the large bowel or by its effect on otherorgans if it has spread. These symptoms may occur aloneor in combination:
• a change in bowel habit• blood in the stool• bloating, persistent abdominal distention
• constipation
• a feeling of fullness even after having a bowel move-
ment
• narrowing of the stool—so-called ribbon stools
• persistent, chronic fatigue
• abdominal discomfort• unexplained weight loss
• very rarely, nausea and vomiting

"• very rarely, nausea and vomiting
Most of these symptoms are caused by the physical
presence of the tumor mass in the colon. Similar symp-toms can be caused by other processes; these are not
absolutely specific to colon cancer. The key is recogniz-ing that the persistence of these types of symptoms with-out ready explanation should prompt the individual toseek medical evaluation.
Many of the symptoms are understood by remem-
bering that the colon is a tubular conduit. If a tumordevelops, as it reaches a certain size it will begin to causesymptoms related to the obstruction of that conduit. Inaddition, the tumor commonly oozes blood that is lost inthe stool. (Often, this blood is not visible.) This phenom-enon results in anemia and chronic fatigue. Weight loss isa late symptom, often implying substantial obstruction orthe presence of systemic disease.
Diagnosis
Screening
Of all of the major cancers, only colorectal cancer"
"Diagnosis
Screening
Of all of the major cancers, only colorectal cancer
can be prevented by screening. In all other cancers (breastand prostate, for example), screening tests look for small,malignant lesions. Screening for colorectal cancers, how-ever, is the search for pre-malignant, benign polyps. Thisscreening can be close to 100% effective in preventingcancer development, not just in detecting small cancers.
Screening involves physical exam, simple laboratory
tests, and the visualization of the lining of the colon. Theways to visualize the colon epithelium are with x rays (indi-rect visualization), and endoscopy (direct visualization).
The physical examination involves the perfor-
mance of a digital rectal exam (DRE). The DRE includesmanual examination of the rectum, anus, and theprostate. During this examination, the physician exam-ines the anus and the surrounding skin for hemorrhoids ,"
"abscesses, and other irregularities. After lubricating thegloved finger and anus, the examiner gently slides thefinger into the anus and follows the contours of the rec-tum. The examiner notes the tone of the anus and feelsthe walls and the edges for texture, tenderness and mass-es as far as the examining finger can reach. At the time ofthis exam, the physician checks the stool on the examin-ing glove with a chemical to see if any occult (invisible),blood is present. At home, after having a bowel move-ment, the patient is asked to swipe a sample of stoolobtained with a small stick on a card. After 3 such speci-mens are on the card, the card is then easily chemicallytested for occult blood also. (The stool analysis men-tioned here is known as a fecal occult blood test ,o r
FOBT, and, while it can be helpful, it is not 100% accu-rate—only about 50% of cancers are FOBT-positive.)These exams are accomplished as an easy part of a rou-tine yearly physical exam."
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 850Colon cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 850
"Proteins are sometimes produced by cancers, and
these may be elevated in the patient’s blood. When thisoccurs, the protein produced is known as a tumor marker.There is a tumor marker for some cancers of the colon; itis known as carcinoembryonic antigen, or CEA. Unfortu-nately, this protein may be made by other adenocarcino-mas as well, or it may not be produced by a particularcolon cancer. Therefore, screening by chemical analysisfor CEA has not been helpful. CEA has been helpfulwhen used in a follow-up role for patients treated forcolon cancer if their tumor makes the protein.
Indirect visualization of the colon may be accom-
plished by placing barium through the rectum and filling thecolon with this compound. Barium produces a white con-trast image of the lining of the colon on x ray and thus, thecontour of the lining of the colon may be seen. Detail can beincreased if the barium utilized is thinned and air also intro-duced. These studies are known as the barium enema (BE)"
"and the double contrast barium enema (DCBE).
Direct visualization of the lining of the colon is
accomplished using a scope or endoscope. The physicianintroduces the instrument through the rectum and passesit proximally, visualizing the colon epithelium in theprocess. Older, shorter scopes were rigid. Today, utiliz-ing fiberoptic technology, the scopes are flexible and canreach much farther. If the left colon only is visualized, itis called flexible sigmoidoscopy . When the entire colon
is visualized, the procedure is known as colonoscopy .
Unlike the indirect visualizations of the colon (the
BE and the DCBE), the endoscopic screeenings allow thephysician to remove polyps and biopsy suspicious tissue.(A biopsy is a removal of tissue for examination by apthologist.) For this reason, many physicians prefer endo-scopic screening. All of the visualizations, the BE,DCBE, and each type of endoscopy require pre-procedurepreparation (evacuation) of the colon."
"The American Cancer Society has recommended the
following screening protocol for those of normal riskover 50 years of age:
• yearly DRE with occult blood in stool testing• flexible sigmoidoscopy at age 50• flexible sigmoidoscopy repeated every five years
Many physicians, however, recommend full colono-
scopy every five to seven years. Screening evaluationsshould start sooner for patients who have predisposingfactors, such as family history, history of polyps, or afamilial syndrome.
Evaluation of patients with symptoms
For those whose symptoms prompt them to visit
their physician, and if their symptoms could possibly berelated to colon cancer, the entire colon will be inspect-"
"ed. The combination of a flexible sigmoidoscopy andDCBE may be performed but the preferred evaluation ofthe entire colon and rectum is that of completecolonoscopy. Colonoscopy allows direct visualization,photography, and the opportunity to obtain a biopsy ofany abnormality visualized. If, for technical reasons, theentire colon is not visualized endoscopically, a DCBEshould complement the colonoscopy.
The diagnosis of colon cancer is actually made by
the performance of a biopsy of any abnormal lesion inthe colon. When a tumor growth is identified, it could beeither a benign polyp (or lesion) or a cancer; the biopsyresolves the issue. The endoscopist may take many sam-ples so as to exclude any sampling errors.
If the patient presents with advanced disease, or has
advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, areas wherethe tumor has spread (such as the liver) may be amenableto biopsy. Such biopsies are usually obtained using a spe-cial needle under local anesthesia."
"Once a diagnosis of colon cancer has been estab-
lished by biopsy, in addition to the physical exam,studies will be performed to assess the extent of thedisease. Blood studies include a complete blood
count ,liver function tests , and a CEA. Imaging stud-
ies will include a chest x ray and a CAT scan (comput-
ed tomography scan) of the abdomen. The chest x raywill determine if there is spread to the lung, and theCAT scan will evaluate potential spread to the liver aswell as any local invasive characteristics of the primarytumor. If the patient has any neurologic symptoms, aCAT scan of the brain will be performed, and if the

"patient is experiencing bone pain , a bone scan will

Treatment
Once the diagnosis has been confirmed by biopsy,
the clinical stage of the cancer is assigned. Using thecharacteristics of the primary tumor, its depth of penetra-tion through the bowel, and the presence or absence ofregional or distant metastases, the stage of the cancer isderived. Often, the depth of penetration through thebowel or the presence of regional lymph nodes can’t beassigned before surgery.
Colon cancer is assigned stages I through IV based
on the following general criteria:
• Stage I: the tumor is confined to the epithelium or has
not penetrated through the first layer of muscle in thebowel wall.
• Stage II: the tumor has penetrated through to the outer
wall of the colon or has gone through it, possibly invad-ing other local tissue.
• Stage III: any depth or size of tumor associated with
regional lymph node involvement.KEY TERMS

Usually, on the basis of the blood supply, the par-tial colectomies are separated into right, left, transverse,or sigmoid. The removal of the blood supply at its originalong with the regional lymph nodes that accompany itassures an adequate margin of normal colon on eitherside of the primary tumor. When the cancer lies in a posi-tion such that the blood supply and lymph drainage liesbetween two of the major vessels, both vessels are takento assure complete radical resection or removal (extend-

"ed radical right or left colectomy). If the primary tumor
penetrates through the bowel wall, any tissue adjacent tothe tumor extension is also taken if feasible.
Surgery is used as primary therapy for stages I
through III colon cancer unless there are signs that localinvasion will not permit complete removal of the tumor,as may occur in advanced stage III tumors. However, thiscircumstance is very rare, and occurs in less than 2% ofall colon cancer cases.
After the resection is completed, the ends of the
remaining colon are reconstructed; the hook-up is calledan anastomosis. Once healing has occurred, there may be aslight increase in the frequency of bowel movements. Thiseffect usually lasts only for several weeks. Most patientsgo on to develop completely normal bowel function.
Occasionally, the anastomosis would be risky and"
"Occasionally, the anastomosis would be risky and
cannot be performed. (Most commonly, this occurs whenthe bowel could not be adequately evacuated in an emer-gency circumstance due to bowel obstruction.) When theanastomosis cannot be performed, a colostomy is per-
formed instead. A colostomy is performed by bringing theend of the colon through the abdominal wall and sewing itto the skin. The patient will have to wear an appliance (abag) to manage the stool. The colostomy may be tempo-rary and the patient may undergo a hook-up at a later, saferdate, or the colostomy may be permanent. In most cases,emergent colostomies are not reversed and are permanent.
Radiation

"Radiation
Radiation therapy is used as an adjunct to surgery
if there is concern about potential for local recurrencepost-operatively and the area of concern will tolerate theradiation. For instance, if the tumor invaded muscle ofthe abdominal wall but was not completely removed, thisarea would be considered for radiation. Radiation hassignificant dose limits when residual bowel is exposed toit because the small and large intestine do not tolerateradiation well.
Radiation is also used in the treatment of patients
who present with or progress to having metastatic dis-ease. It is particularly useful in shrinking metastaticcolon cancer to the brain.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is useful for patients who have had
all identifiable tumor removed and are at risk for recur-rence (adjuvant chemotherapy). Chemotherapy may alsobe used when the cancer is stage IV and is beyond thescope of regional therapy, but this use is rare.
Adjuvant therapy is considered in stage II disease"
"Adjuvant therapy is considered in stage II disease
with deep penetration or in stage III patients. Standardtherapy is treatment with 5-fluorouracil, (5FU) combined
with leucovorin for a period of six to 12 months. 5FU isan antimetabolite and leukovorin improves the responserate. (A response is a temporary regression of the cancerin response to the chemotherapy.) Another agent, lev-amisole, (which seems to stimulate the immune system),may be substituted for leucovorin. These protocolsreduce rate of recurrence by about 15% and reduce mor-tality by about 10%. The regimens do have some toxicity,but usually are tolerated fairly well.
Similar chemotherapy may be administered for stage"
"Similar chemotherapy may be administered for stage
IV disease or if a patient progresses and develops metas-tases. Results show response rates of about 20%. Unfortu-nately, these patients eventually succumb to the disease,and this chemotherapy may not prolong survival orimprove quality of life in Stage IV patients. Clinical trialshave now shown that the results can be improved with theaddition of another agent to this regimen. Irinotecan doesnot seem to increase toxicity but it improved response ratesto 39%, added two to three months to disease-free survival,and prolonged overall survival by a little over two months.

"large-scale, scientific way. Large doses of vitamins ,
fiber, and green tea are among therapies tried. Avoidingcigarettes and alcohol may be helpful. Before initiatingany alternative therapies, the patient is wise to consulthis/her physician to be sure that these therapies do notcomplicate or interfere with the established therapy.
Prognosis
Prognosis is the long-term outlook or survival after
therapy. Overall, about 50% of patients treated for coloncancer survive the disease. As expected, the survival ratesare dependent upon the stage of the cancer at the time ofdiagnosis, making early detection a very worthwhileendeavor.
About 15% of patients present with stage I disease
and 85–90% survive. Stage II represents 20–30% ofcases and 65–75% survive. Thirt to forty percent com-prise the stage III presentation of which 55% survive.The remaining 20–25% present with stage IV diseaseand are very rarely cured.

tion. High-fiber diets and vitamins, avoiding obesity , and
staying active lessen the risk. Avoiding cigarettes andalcohol may be helpful. By controlling these environ-mental factors, an individual can lessen risk and to thisdegree prevent the disease.
By undergoing appropriate screening when uncon-
trollable genetic risk factors have been identified, anindividual may be rewarded by the identification ofbenign polyps that can be treated as opposed to havingthese growths degenerate into a malignancy.

"Colonic irrigation
Definition
Colonic irrigation is also known as hydrotherapy of
the colon, high colonic, entero-lavage, or simply colonic. Itis the process of cleansing the colon by passing several gal-lons of water through it with the use of special equipment.It is similar to an enema but treats the whole colon, not justthe lower bowel. This has the effect of flushing out impact-ed fecal matter, toxins, mucous, and even parasites thatoften build up over the passage of time. It is a procedurethat should only be undertaken by a qualified practitioner.
Purpose
Anyone suffering from gas, bloating, cramping
pains, acne and other skin complaints, arthritis, and a list
of bowel complaints such as diverticulitis and irritablebowel etc., may benefit from colonic irrigation. In partic-ular, cancer patients are often advised to undertake a"
"course of colonic irrigation sessions as an essential partof their treatment. When a biological cancer therapybegins to enable the body to breakdown a cancerousmass, it is essential that speedy and effective eliminationof the resulting toxins is achieved.
Colon and bowel cancer is one of the leading causes
of death in the United States, and alternative practitioners
insist that it can be prevented by efficient hygiene proce-dures. Providing that care is taken to replace the naturalorganisms that flourish in the bowel, many health benefitscan be expected from colonic irrigation. In general, alter-native practitioners maintain that an ill-functioning bowelis the source of all disease, and therefore keeping it cleanwill be an effective protection against this.
Removing large amounts of toxic matter relieves the
patient and can lead to the alleviation of symptoms suchas arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome ,candidiasis , and"
"a host of other illnesses. Properly executed, colonic irriga-tion can help restore normal peristaltic action to a slug-gish bowel, thus reducing the need for more hydrotherapytreatments over time. In addition, removing the layer offecal matter which coats the intestines in many individu-als allows improved assimilation of the nutrients fromfoods and can alleviate symptoms of vitamin and othernutrient deficiencies. Many alternative health practition-ers consider some form of hydrotherapy for the bowel tobe essential in the treatment of degenerative diseases.
Description
Origins
Cleansing the colon with the use of hydrotherapy is
not a new concept. Forms of colonic irrigation have beenused successfully for decades to relieve chronic toxicityand even acute cases of toxemia.
Over time, many people develop a thick layer of
fecal matter that coats their colon. It hardens andbecomes impacted, reducing the efficiency of the bowel,"
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 854Colonic irrigationGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 854
"and in some cases, completely obstructing normal elimi-
nation of waste matter from the body. It is quite commonfor people to only have one bowel movement per day,and some as few as one or two per week.
Alternative practitioners advise that we probably
should have one bowel movement for every meal that weeat. If not, then we are not eliminating wastes complete-ly, and if input exceeds output, then we will surely sufferthe consequences at some point.
Incomplete elimination of body wastes may result in
the following, depending on where the deposits end up:
• sluggish system
• joint pain and arthritis
• irritable bowel syndrome• diverticulitis
•Crohn’s disease
• leaky gut syndrome• heart problem• migraine
•allergies
• bad breath• acne and other skin problems such as psoriasis• asthma• early senility and Alzheimer’s disease
• chronic fatigue syndrome
• cancer, particularly of the bowel• multiple sclerosis

"During colonic irrigation, a small speculum is
passed into the patient’s bowel through the rectum. Thisis attached to a tube, which leads to a machine thatpumps temperature-controlled water into the colon at acontrolled rate (to be controlled by either the practitioneror the patient). The temperature of the water should ide-ally be kept as close to body temperature as possible.
The patient will temporarily be filled with water up
to the level of the entire colon. Patients say they can feelthe water up under their ribs but that the process,although sometimes uncomfortable, is not painful. Theamount of water will vary but will generally be in theregion of between two and six liters (or quarts) at anyone time. This triggers peristaltic action and the patientwill begin to expel the water along with fecal matter backthrough the tube and into the machine.

"reflexology , or lymphatic drainage techniques may be used
to loosen deposits and stimulate the bowel. It is importantthat the right amount of water is used, as too much willcause discomfort and too little will be ineffective. If cor-rectly done, colonic irrigation is not painful at all and somepatients claim to sleep through their treatment.
Sanitation is vital to this process. The tubes and
speculums used are generally disposable, but other partsof the machine, such as the viewing tube, must be steril-ized after each patient.
Normally, a series of treatments will be required to
achieve desired results regarding the elimination ofimpacted, decaying matter, and restoration of bowel reg-ularity. Initially, only gas and recent fecal matter may beexpelled.

"Impacted fecal matter can cause an imbalance of the
natural organisms that normally populate the bowel, caus-ing what is known as dysbiosis. Under ideal conditions,the bowel is populated by a variety of naturally occurringorganisms.

may lead to many health problems, as constipation caus-
es backed up pollution of the body cells. The process ofrepair and elimination of wastes enters a downward spi-ral which at best will cause fatigue, lack of energy and

is generally between $35–70 per session, which maylast from 45 minutes to one hour. The cost of themachine itself ranges from $4,000–12,000, but again, itshould be noted that only qualified therapists shouldconduct sessions.

"Precautions
It may be advisable to use a probiotic pessary after

There are certain conditions that either partlyor completely preclude the use of colonic irrigation, suchas an active attack of Crohn’s disease, bleeding ulcers,and hyperacidosis. If in doubt, a qualified practitionershould be consulted. Anyone suffering from these condi-tions should always notify the practitioner when receiv-ing colonic irrigation treatments.
Side effects
Some allopathic practitioners claim that colonic irri-
gation flushes out essential electrolytes and friendly bac-teria from the bowel and that it can be dangerous. Practi-tioners counter that this can easily be remedied with theuse of probiotics, and that in any case, these possible dis-advantages are easily offset by the benefits of havinglarge amounts of putrefying matter, harmful organisms,and parasites removed from the system.

"Research and general acceptance
Although many alternative health care practitioners
swear by colonic irrigation, there is a large allopathiclobby that claims that there are no benefits to be had, andthat there are dangers involved. However, there are manydecades of records and research from the alternativehealth care community that indicate that this therapy mayhave a valuable place in the treatment of degenerativediseases and toxic conditions.

Colonoscopy
Definition
Colonoscopy is a medical procedure where a long,
flexible, tubular instrument called the colonoscope isused to view the entire inner lining of the colon (largeintestine) and the rectum.
Purpose
A colonoscopy is generally recommended when the
patient complains of rectal bleeding or has a change inbowel habits and other unexplained abdominal symp-toms. The test is frequently used to test for colorectalcancer , especially when polyps or tumor-like growths
have been detected using the barium enema and other
diagnostic tests. Polyps can be removed through thecolonoscope and samples of tissue (biopsies) can betaken to test for the presence of cancerous cells.
The test also enables the physician to check for
bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s
disease . It is a necessary tool in monitoring patients who
have a past history of polyps or colon cancer .

"Description
The procedure can be done either in the doctor’s
office or in a special procedure room of a local hospital.An intravenous (IV) line will be started in a vein in thearm. The patient is generally given a sedative and a pain-killer through the IV line.
During the colonoscopy, the patient will be asked to
lie on his/her left side with his/her knees drawn uptowards the abdomen. The doctor begins the procedureby inserting a lubricated, gloved finger into the anus tocheck for any abnormal masses or blockage. A thin, well-lubricated colonoscope will then be inserted into the anusand it will be gently advanced through the colon. The lin-ing of the intestine will be examined through the scope.Occasionally air may be pumped through the colono-scope to help clear the path or open the colon. If there are

"excessive secretions, stool, or blood that obstruct the
viewing, they will be suctioned out through the scope.The doctor may press on the abdomen or ask the patientto change his/her position in order to advance the scopethrough the colon.
The entire length of the large intestine can be exam-
ined in this manner. If suspicious growths are observed,tiny biopsy forceps or brushes can be inserted throughthe colon and tissue samples can be obtained. Smallpolyps can also be removed through the colonoscope.After the procedure, the colonoscope is slowly with-drawn and the instilled air is allowed to escape. The analarea is then cleansed with tissues.
The procedure may take anywhere from 30 minutes
to two hours depending on how easy it is to advance thescope through the colon. Colonoscopy can be a long anduncomfortable procedure, and the bowel cleaning prepa-ration may be tiring and can produce diarrhea and"
"cramping. During the colonoscopy, the sedative and thepain medications will keep the patient very drowsy and
relaxed. Most patients complain of minor discomfort andpressure from the colonoscope moving inside. However,the procedure is not painful.
Preparation
The doctor should be notified if the patient has aller-
gies to any medications or anesthetics; any bleeding
problems; or if the woman is pregnant. The doctor shouldalso be informed of all the medications that the person iscurrently on and if he or she has had a barium x-rayexamination recently. If the patient has had heart valvesreplaced, the doctor should be informed so that appropri-ate antibiotics can be administered to prevent any
chance of infection. The risks of the procedure will be

It is important that the colon be thoroughly cleaned
before performing the examination. Hence, before theexamination, considerable preparation is necessary toclear the colon of all stool. The patient will be asked torefrain from eating any solid food for 24–48 hours beforethe test. Only clear liquids such as juices, broth, and Jelloare recommended. The patient is advised to drink plentyof water to avoid dehydration . The evening before the
test, the patient will have to take a strong laxative that thedoctor has prescribed. Several 1 qt enemas of warm tap
water may have to be taken on the morning of the exam.Commercial enemas (e.g., Fleet) may be used.

how to use the enema and how many such enemas arenecessary. Generally, the procedure has to be repeatedKEY TERMS

Color blindness
Definition
Color blindness is an abnormal condition character-
ized by the inability to clearly distinguish different colorsof the spectrum. The difficulties can be mild to severe. Itis a misleading term because people with color blindnessare not blind. Rather, they tend to see colors in a limitedrange of hues; a rare few may not see colors at all.
Description
Normal color vision requires the use of specialized
receptor cells called cones, which are located in the reti-na of the eye. There are three types of cones, termed red,blue, and green, which enable people to see a wide spec-trum of colors. An abnormality, or deficiency, of any ofthe types of cones will result in abnormal color vision.
There are three basic variants of color blindness."
"There are three basic variants of color blindness.
Red/green color blindness (deuteranopia) is the mostcommon deficiency, affecting 8% of Caucasian malesand 0.5% of Caucasian females. The prevalence varieswith culture.Blue color blindness (protanopia) is an inability to
distinguish both blue and yellow, which are seen as whiteor gray. Protanopia is quite rare and has equal prevalencein males and females. It is common for young children tohave blue/green confusion that becomes less pronouncedin adulthood. Blue color deficiency often appears in peo-ple who have physical disorders such as liver disease ordiabetes mellitus .
A total inability to distinguish colors (achromatop-
sia) is exceedingly rare. These affected individuals viewthe world in shades of gray. They frequently have poorvisual acuity and are extremely sensitive to light (photo-phobia), which causes them to squint in ordinary light.
Researchers studying red/green color blindness in"
"Researchers studying red/green color blindness in
the United Kingdom reported an average prevalence ofonly 4.7% in one group. Only 1% of Eskimo males arecolor blind. Approximately 2.9% of boys from SaudiArabia and 3.7% from India were found to have deficientcolor vision. Red/green color blindness may slightlyincrease an affected person’s chances of contracting lep-
rosy. Pre-term infants exhibit an increased prevalence of
blue color blindness. Achromatopsia has a prevalence ofabout 1 in 33,000 in the United States and affects malesand females equally.
Causes and symptoms
Red/green and blue color blindness appear to be"
"Causes and symptoms
Red/green and blue color blindness appear to be
located on at least two different gene locations. Themajority of affected individuals are males. Females arecarriers, but are not normally affected. This indicates thatthe X chromosome is one of the locations for color blind-ness. Male offspring of females who carry the alteredgene have a 50-50 chance of being color-blind. The rarefemale that has red/green color blindness, or rarer still,blue color blindness, indicates there is an involvement ofanother gene. As of 2001, the location of this gene hasnot been identified.
Achromatopsia, the complete inability to distinguish"
"Achromatopsia, the complete inability to distinguish
color, is an autosomal recessive disease of the retina.This means that both parents have one copy of the alteredgene but do not have the disease. Each of their childrenhas a 25% chance of not having the gene, a 50% chanceof having one altered gene (and, like the parents, beingunaffected), and a 25% risk of having both the alteredgene and the condition. In 1997, the achromatopsia genewas located on chromosome 2.
The inability to correctly identify colors is the only
sign of color blindness. It is important to note that peoplewith red/green or blue varieties of color blindness useother cues such as color saturation and object shape orlocation to distinguish colors. They can often distinguish

"red or green if they can visually compare the colors.
However, most have difficulty accurately identifying col-ors without any other references. Most people with anyimpairment in color vision learn colors, as do otheryoung children. These individuals often reach adoles-cence before their visual deficiency is identified.
Color blindness is sometimes acquired. Chronic ill-
nesses that can lead to color blindness include Alzheimer’s
disease , diabetes mellitus, glaucoma , leukemia, liver dis-
ease, chronic alcoholism ,macular degeneration ,multi-
ple sclerosis ,Parkinson’s disease , sickle cell anemia, and
retinitis pigmentosa . Accidents or strokes that damage the
retina or affect particular areas of the brain eye can lead tocolor blindness. Some medications such as antibiotics ,
barbiturates , anti-tuberculosis drugs, high blood pressure"
"barbiturates , anti-tuberculosis drugs, high blood pressure
medications, and several medications used to treat nervousdisorders and psychological problems may cause colorblindness. Industrial or environmental chemicals such ascarbon monoxide, carbon disulfide, fertilizers, styrene, andsome containing lead can cause loss of color vision. Occa-sionally, changes can occur in the affected person’s capaci-ty to see colors after age 60.
Diagnosis
There are several tests available to identify problems
associated with color vision. The most commonly used isthe American Optical/Hardy, Rand, and Ritter Pseudo-isochromatic test. It is composed of several discs filledwith colored dots of different sizes and colors. A personwith normal color vision looking at a test item sees aKEY TERMS

"The Ishihara test is comprised of eight plates that are
similar to the American Optical Pseudoisochromatic testplates. The individual being tested looks for numbersamong the various colored dots on each test plate. Someplates distinguish between red/green and blue colorblindness. Individuals with normal color vision perceiveone number. Those with red/green color deficiency see adifferent number. Those with blue color vision see yet adifferent number.
A third analytical tool is the Titmus II Vision Tester
Color Perception test. The subject looks into a stereo-scopic machine. The test stimulus most often used inprofessional offices contains six different designs ornumbers on a black background, framed in a yellow bor-der. Titmus II can test one eye at a time. However, itsvalue is limited because it can only identify red/greendeficiencies and is not highly accurate.

"Treatment
There is no treatment or cure for color blindness.
Most color vision deficient persons compensate well fortheir abnormality and usually rely on color cues anddetails that are not consciously evident to persons withtypical color vision.
Inherited color blindness cannot be prevented. In the
case of some types of acquired color deficiency, if thecause of the problem is removed, the condition mayimprove with time. But for most people with acquiredcolor blindness, the damage is usually permanent.
Prognosis
Color blindness that is inherited is present in both
eyes and remains constant over an individual’s entire life.Some cases of acquired color vision loss are not severe,may appear in only one eye, and last for only a shorttime. Other cases tend to be progressive, becoming worsewith time.

Colostomy
Definition
Ostomy is a surgical procedure used to create an
opening for urine and feces to be released from the body.Colostomy refers to a surgical procedure where a portionof the large intestine is brought through the abdominalwall to carry stool out of the body.
Purpose
A colostomy is created as a means to treat various
disorders of the large intestine, including cancer , obstruc-
tion, inflammatory bowel disease, ruptured diverticulum,ischemia (compromised blood supply), or traumatic"
"injury. Temporary colostomies are created to divert stoolfrom injured or diseased portions of the large intestine,allowing rest and healing. Permanent colostomies are per-formed when the distal bowel (bowel at the farthest dis-tance) must be removed or is blocked and inoperable.Although colorectal cancer is the most common indica-tion for a permanent colostomy, only about 10–15% ofpatients with this diagnosis require a colostomy.
Description
Surgery will result in one of three types of colos-
tomies:

"tomies:
• End colostomy. The functioning end of the intestine
(the section of bowel that remains connected to theupper gastrointestinal tract) is brought out onto the sur-face of the abdomen, forming the stoma by cuffing theintestine back on itself and suturing the end to the skin.A stoma is an artificial opening created to the surface ofthe body. The surface of the stoma is actually the liningof the intestine, usually appearing moist and pink. Thedistal portion of bowel (now connected only to the rec-tum) may be removed, or sutured closed and left in theabdomen. An end colostomy is usually a permanentostomy, resulting from trauma, cancer or another patho-logical condition.

"• Double–barrel colostomy. This colsotomy involves the
creation of two separate stomas on the abdominal wall.The proximal (nearest) stoma is the functional end thatis connected to the upper gastrointestinal tract and willdrain stool. The distal stoma, connected to the rectumand also called a mucous fistula, drains small amountsof mucus material. This is most often a temporarycolostomy performed to rest an area of bowel, and to belater closed.
• Loop colostomy. This colostomy is created by bringing
a loop of bowel through an incision in the abdominalwall. The loop is held in place outside the abdomen bya plastic rod slipped beneath it. An incision is made inthe bowel to allow the passage of stool through the loopcolostomy. The supporting rod is removed approxi-mately 7-10 days after surgery, when healing hasoccurred that will prevent the loop of bowel from

"retracting into the abdomen. A loop colostomy is most
often performed for creation of a temporary stoma todivert stool away from an area of intestine that has beenblocked or ruptured.
Preparation
As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be
required to sign a consent form after the procedure isexplained thoroughly. Blood and urine studies, alongwith various x rays and an electrocardiograph (EKG),may be ordered as the doctor deems necessary. If possi-ble, the patient should visit an enterostomal therapist,who will mark an appropriate place on the abdomen forthe stoma, and offer pre-operative education on ostomymanagement.
In order to empty and cleanse the bowel, the patient
may be placed on a low residue diet for several days priorto surgery. A liquid diet may be ordered for at least theday before surgery, with nothing by mouth after mid-night. A series of enemas and/or oral preparations"
"(GoLytely or Colyte) may be ordered to empty the bowelof stool. Oral anti-infectives (neomycin, erythromycin,
or kanamycin sulfate) may be ordered to decrease bacte-ria in the intestine and help prevent post-operative infec-tion. A nasogastric tube is inserted from the nose to thestomach on the day of surgery or during surgery toremove gastric secretions and prevent nausea and vom-
iting . A urinary catheter (a thin plastic tube) may also be
inserted to keep the bladder empty during surgery, givingmore space in the surgical field and decreasing chancesof accidental injury.
Aftercare
Post-operative care for the patient with a new colos-
tomy, as with those who have had any major surgery,involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respirations,and temperature. Breathing tends to be shallow becauseof the effect of anesthesia and the patient’s reluctance tobreathe deeply and experience pain that is caused by the"
"abdominal incision. The patient is instructed how to sup-port the operative site during deep breathing and cough-ing, and given pain medication as necessary. Fluid intakeand output is measured, and the operative site is observed

Fluids and electrolytes are infused intravenouslyuntil the patient’s diet is can gradually be resumed, begin-ning with liquids. Usually within 72 hours, passage of gasand stool through the stoma begins. Initially the stool isliquid, gradually thickening as the patient begins to takesolid foods. The patient is usually out of bed in 8–24hours after surgery and discharged in 2–4 days.

"A colostomy pouch will generally have been placed
on the patient’s abdomen, around the stoma, duringsurgery. During the hospital stay, the patient and his orher caregivers will be educated on how to care for thecolostomy. Determination of appropriate pouching sup-plies and a schedule of how often to change the pouchshould be established. Regular assessment and meticu-lous care of the skin surrounding the stoma is importantto maintain an adequate surface on which to apply thepouch. Some patients with colostomies are able to rou-tinely irrigate the stoma, resulting in regulation of bowelfunction; rather than needing to wear a pouch, thesepatients may need only a dressing or cap over theirstoma. Often, an enterostomal therapist will visit thepatient at home after discharge to help with the patient’sresumption of normal daily activities.

Colposcopy
Definition
Colposcopy is a procedure that allows a physician to
take a closer look at a woman’s cervix and vagina using aspecial instrument called a colposcope. It is used tocheck for precancerous or abnormal areas. The colpo-scope can magnify the area between 10 and 40 times;some devices also can take photographs.
Purpose
The colposcope helps to identify abnormal areas of
the cervix or vagina so that small pieces of tissue (biop-sies) can be taken for further analysis."
"the cervix or vagina so that small pieces of tissue (biop-sies) can be taken for further analysis.
Colposcopy is used to identify or rule out the exis-
tence of any precancerous conditions in the cervical tis-sue. If a PAP test shows abnormal cell growth, further
testing, such as colposcopy, often is required. A PAP testis a screening test that involves scraping cells from theoutside of the cervix. If abnormal cells are found, thephysician will attempt to find the area that produced theabnormal cells and remove it for further study (biopsy).Only then can a diagnosis be made.
Colposcopy may also be performed if the cervix
looks abnormal during a routine examination. It may alsobe suggested for women with genital warts and for
diethylstilbestrol (DES) daughters (women whose moth-ers took DES when pregnant with them).

"Precautions
Women who are pregnant, or who suspect that they
are pregnant, must tell their doctor before the procedurebegins. Pregnant women can, and should, have a col-poscopy if they have an abnormal PAP test. However, spe-cial precautions must be taken during biopsy of the cervix.
Description
A colposcopy is performed in a physician’s office
and is similar to a regular gynecologic exam. An instru-ment called a speculum is used to hold the vagina open,and the gynecologist looks at the cervix and vaginathrough the colposcope instead simply by eye, as in aroutine examination.
The colposcope is placed outside the patient’s body
and never touches the skin. The cervix and vagina areswabbed with dilute acetic acid (vinegar). The solutionhighlights abnormal areas by turning them white (insteadof a normal pink color). Abnormal areas can also beidentified by looking for a characteristic pattern made byabnormal blood vessels."

"If any abnormal areas are seen, the doctor will take a
biopsy of the tissue, a common procedure that takesabout 15 minutes. Several samples might be taken,depending on the size of the abnormal area. A biopsymay cause temporary discomfort and cramping, whichusually go away within a few minutes. If the abnormalarea appears to extend inside the cervical canal, a scrap-ing of the canal may be done. The biopsy results are usu-ally available within a week.
If the tissue sample indicates abnormal growth (dys-
plasia) or precancer, and if the entire abnormal area canbe seen, the doctor can destroy the tissue using one ofseveral procedures, including ones that use high heat(diathermy), extreme cold (cryosurgery), or lasers.Another procedure, called a loop electrosurgical excision(LEEP), uses low-voltage high-frequency radio waves toexcise tissue. If any of the abnormal tissue is within thecervical canal, a cone biopsy (removal of a conical sec-tion of the cervix for inspection) will be needed."
"Preparation
Colposcopy is a painless procedure that does not
require any anesthetic medication. If a biopsy is done,there may be mild cramps or a sharp pinching when thetissue is removed. To lessen this pain , your doctor may
recommend 800 mg of ibuprofen (Motrin) taken thenight before and the morning of the procedure (no laterthan 30 minutes before the appointment). Patients whoare pregnant or allergic to aspirin or ibuprofen can take
two tablets of acetaminophen (Tylenol) instead.

discharge afterwards. After the sample is removed, theKEY TERMS

Coma
Definition
Coma, from the Greek word “koma,” meaning deep
sleep, is a state of extreme unresponsiveness, in which anindividual exhibits no voluntary movement or behavior.Furthermore, in a deep coma, even painful stimuli(actions which, when performed on a healthy individual,result in reactions) are unable to affect any response, andnormal reflexes may be lost.

"Description
Coma lies on a spectrum with other alterations in con-
sciousness. The level of consciousness required by, forexample, someone reading this passage lies at one extremeend of the spectrum, while complete brain death lies at the
other end of the spectrum. In between are such states asobtundation, drowsiness, and stupor. All of these are con-ditions which, unlike coma, still allow the individual torespond to stimuli, although such a response may be briefand require stimulus of greater than normal intensity.
In order to understand the loss of function suffered
by a comatose individual, it is necessary to first under-stand the important characteristics of the conscious state.Consciousness is defined by two fundamental elements:awareness and arousal.

"Awareness allows one to receive and process all the
information communicated by the five senses, and thusrelate to oneself and to the outside world. Awareness hasboth psychological and physiological components. Thepsychological component is governed by an individual’smind and mental processes. The physiological compo-nent refers to the functioning of an individual’s brain,and therefore that brain’s physical and chemical condi-tion. Awareness is regulated by cortical areas within thecerebral hemispheres, the outermost layer of the brainthat separates humans from other animals by allowingfor greater intellectual functioning.
Arousal is regulated solely by physiological func-"
"Arousal is regulated solely by physiological func-
tioning and consists of more primitive responsiveness tothe world, as demonstrated by predictable reflex (invol-untary) responses to stimuli. Arousal is maintained bythe reticular activating system (RAS). This is not ananatomical area of the brain, but rather a network ofstructures (including the brainstem, the medulla, and thethalamus) and nerve pathways, which function togetherto produce and maintain arousal.
Causes and symptoms
Coma, then, is the result of something that interferes
with the functioning of the cerebral cortex and/or thefunctioning of the structures which make up the RAS. Infact, a huge and varied number of conditions can result incoma. A good way of categorizing these conditions is toconsider the anatomic and the metabolic causes of coma.Anatomic causes of coma are those conditions that dis-rupt the normal physical architecture of the brain struc-tures responsible for consciousness, either at the level of"

There are many metabolic causes of coma, including:
• A decrease in the delivery to the brain of substances
necessary for appropriate brain functioning, such asoxygen, glucose (sugar), and sodium.
• The presence of certain substances that disrupt the
functioning of neurons. Drugs or alcohol in toxic quan-tities can result in neuronal dysfunction, as can sub-stances normally found in the body, but that, due tosome diseased state, accumulate at toxic levels. Accu-mulated substances that might cause coma includeammonia due to liver disease, ketones due to uncon-trolled diabetes, or carbon dioxide due to a severe asth-

Fifteen is thelargest possible number of total points, indicating thehighest level of functioning. The highest level of func-tioning would be demonstrated by an individual whospontaneously opens his/her eyes, gives appropriateanswers to questions about his/her situation, and cancarry out a command (such as “move your leg” or “nodyour head”). Three is the least possible number of totalpoints and would be given to a patient for whom not evena painful stimulus is sufficient to provoke a response. Inthe middle are those patients who may be able torespond, but who require an intense or painful stimulus,and whose response may demonstrate some degree ofbrain malfunctioning (such as a person whose onlyresponse to pain in a limb is to bend that limb in toward"

If head trama has not been exclud-ed, the neck should be stablized in the event of fracture. Itis obviously extremely important for a physician to deter-mine quickly the cause of a coma, so that potentiallyreversible conditions are treated immediately.

injury can be reduced with certain medications. Variousmetabolic disorders can be addressed by supplying theindividual with the correct amount of oxygen, glucose, orsodium; by treating the underlying disease in liver dis-ease, asthma, or diabetes; and by halting seizures withmedication. Because of their low incidence of side effectsand potential for prompt reversal of coma in certain con-ditions, glucose, the B-vitamin thiamine, and Narcan (tocounteract any narcotic-type drugs) are routinely given.

"Prognosis
Some conditions that cause coma can be completely
reversed, restoring the individual to his or her originallevel of functioning. However, if areas of the brain havebeen sufficiently damaged due to the severity or durationof the condition which led to the coma, the individualmay recover from the coma with permanent disabilities,or may even never regain consciousness. Take, for exam-ple, the situation of someone whose coma was caused bybrain injury in a car accident. Such an injury can result inone of three outcomes. In the event of a less severe braininjury, with minimal swelling, an individual may indeedrecover consciousness and regain all of his or her originalabilities. In the event of a more severe brain injury, withswelling that resulted in further pressure on areas of thebrain, an individual may regain consciousness, but mayhave some degree of impairment. The impairment maybe physical (such as paralysis of a leg) or may even"
"result in a change in the individual’s intellectual func-tioning and/or personality. The most severe types ofbrain injury, short of death, result in states in which theindividual loses all ability to function and remains deeplyunresponsive. An individual who has suffered such asevere brain injury may remain in a coma indefinitely.This condition is termed persistent vegetative state .
Outcome from a coma is therefore quite variable and
depends a great deal on the cause and duration of the coma.In the case of drug poisonings, extremely high rates ofrecovery can be expected following prompt medical atten-tion. Patients who have suffered head injuries tend to dobetter than do patients whose coma was caused by othertypes of medical illnesses. Leaving out those people whosecoma followed drug poisoning , only about 15% of patients"
"who remain in a coma for more than just a few hours makea good recovery. Those adult patients who remain in acoma for greater than four weeks have almost no chance ofeventually regaining their previous level of functioning. Onthe other hand, children and young adults have regainedfunctioning even after two months in a coma.

Common cold
Definition
The common cold is a viral infection of the upper
respiratory system, including the nose, throat, sinuses,eustachian tubes, trachea, larynx, and bronchial tubes.Although over 200 different viruses can cause a cold,30–50% are caused by a group known as rhinoviruses.Almost all colds clear up in less than two weeks withoutcomplications.
Description
Colds, sometimes called rhinovirus or coronavirus
infections, are the most common illness to strike any partof the body. It is estimated that the average person hasmore than 50 colds during a lifetime. Anyone can get acold, although pre-school and grade school childrencatch them more frequently than adolescents and adults.Repeated exposure to viruses causing colds creates par-tial immunity."
"Although most colds resolve on their own without
complications, they are a leading cause of visits to thedoctor and of time lost from work and school. Treatingsymptoms of the common cold has given rise to a multi-million dollar industry in over-the-counter medications.
Cold season in the United States begins in early
autumn and extends through early spring. Although it isnot true that getting wet or being in a draft causes a cold(a person has to come in contact with the virus to catch acold), certain conditions may lead to increased suscepti-bility. These include:
• fatigue and overwork• emotional stress
• poor nutrition
•smoking
• living or working in crowded conditions
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 869Common coldGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 869"
"Colds make the upper respiratory system less resis-
tant to bacterial infection. Secondary bacterial infectionmay lead to middle ear infection, bronchitis ,pneumo-
nia, sinus infection, or strep throat . People with chronic
lung disease, asthma , diabetes, or a weakened immune
system are more likely to develop these complications.
Causes and symptoms
Colds are caused by more than 200 different viruses.
The most common groups are rhinoviruses and coron-aviruses. Different groups of viruses are more infectiousat different seasons of the year, but knowing the exactvirus causing the cold is not important in treatment.
People with colds are contagious during the first two
to four days of the infection. Colds pass from person toperson in several ways. When an infected person coughs,sneezes, or speaks, tiny fluid droplets containing the virusare expelled. If these are breathed in by other people, thevirus may establish itself in their noses and airways."
"Colds may also be passed through direct contact. If a
person with a cold touches his runny nose or watery eyes,then shakes hands with another person some of the virus istransferred to the uninfected person. If that person thentouches his mouth, nose, or eyes, the virus is transferred toan environment where it can reproduce and cause a cold.
Finally, cold viruses can be spread through inani-
mate objects (door knobs, telephones, toys) that becomecontaminated with the virus. This is a common methodof transmission in child care centers. If a child with acold touches his runny nose, then plays with a toy, someof the virus may be transferred to the toy. When anotherchild plays with the toy a short time later, he may pick upsome of the virus on his hands. The second child thentouches his contaminated hands to his eyes, nose, ormouth and transfers some of the cold virus to himself.
Once acquired, the cold virus attaches itself to the"
"Once acquired, the cold virus attaches itself to the
lining of the nasal passages and sinuses. This causes theinfected cells to release a chemical called histamine. His-tamine increases the blood flow to the infected cells,causing swelling, congestion, and increased mucus pro-duction. Within one to three days the infected personbegins to show cold symptoms.
The first cold symptoms are a tickle in the throat,
runny nose, and sneezing. The initial discharge from thenose is clear and thin. Later it changes to a thick yellowor greenish discharge. Most adults do not develop a fever
when they catch a cold. Young children may develop alow fever of up to 102°F (38.9°C).
In addition to a runny nose and fever, signs of a cold
include coughing, sneezing, nasal congestion, headache ,
muscle ache, chills, sore throat , hoarseness, wateryeyes, tiredness, and lack of appetite. The cough that
accompanies a cold is usually intermittent and dry.
Most people begin to feel better four to five days"
"Most people begin to feel better four to five days
after their cold symptoms become noticeable. All symp-toms are generally gone within ten days, except for a drycough that may linger for up to three weeks.
Colds make people more susceptible to bacterial
infections such as strep throat, middle ear infections, andsinus infections. A person whose cold does not begin toimprove within a week; or who experiences chest pain ,
fever for more than a few days, difficulty breathing,bluish lips or fingernails, a cough that brings up green-ish-yellow or grayish sputum, skin rash, swollen glands,or whitish spots on the tonsils or throat should consult adoctor to see if they have acquired a secondary bacterialinfection that needs to be treated with an antibiotic.
People who have emphysema , chronic lung disease,
diabetes, or a weakened immune system—either fromdiseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as the result of
medications, ( corticosteroids ,chemotherapy drugs)—"
"medications, ( corticosteroids ,chemotherapy drugs)—
should consult their doctor if they get a cold. People withthese health problems are more likely to get a secondaryinfection.
Diagnosis
Colds are diagnosed by observing a person’s symp-
toms. There are no laboratory tests readily available todetect the cold virus. However, a doctor may do a throat
culture or blood test to rule out a secondary infection.
Influenza is sometimes confused with a cold, but flu
causes much more severe symptoms and generally afever. Allergies to molds or pollens also can make the
nose run. Allergies are usually more persistent than thecommon cold. An allergist can do tests to determine ifthe cold-like symptoms are being caused by an allergicreaction. Also, some people get a runny nose when theygo outside in winter and breathe cold air. This type ofrunny nose is not a symptom of a cold.

"Treatment
There are no medicines that will cure the common
cold. Given time, the body’s immune system will makeantibodies to fight the infection, and the cold will beresolved without any intervention. Antibiotics are use-
less against a cold. However, a great deal of money isspent by pharmaceutical companies in the United Statespromoting products designed to relieve cold symptoms.These products usually contain antihistamines ,decon-
gestants , and/or pain relievers.
Antihistamines block the action of the chemical hist-
amine that is produced when the cold virus invades the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 870Common coldGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 870"
"cells lining the nasal passages. Histamine increases
blood flow and causes the cells to swell. Antihistaminesare taken to relieve the symptoms of sneezing, runnynose, itchy eyes, and congestion. Side effects are dry
mouth and drowsiness, especially with the first few
doses. Antihistamines should not be taken by people whoare driving or operating dangerous equipment. Somepeople have allergic reactions to antihistamines. Com-mon over-the-counter antihistamines include Chlor-Trimeton, Dimetapp, Tavist, and Actifed. The genericname for two common antihistamines are chlorpheni-ramine and diphenhydramine.
Decongestants work to constrict the blood flow to
the vessels in the nose. This can shrink the tissue, reducecongestion, and open inflamed nasal passages, makingbreathing easier. Decongestants can make people feel jit-tery or keep them from sleeping. They should not be usedby people with heart disease, high blood pressure, orglaucoma . Some common decongestants are Neo-"
"Synepherine, Novafed, and Sudafed. The generic namesof common decongestants include phenylephrine,phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine, and in nasalsprays naphazoline, oxymetazoline and xylometazoline.
Many over the counter medications are combina-
tions of both antihistamines and decongestants; an acheand pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Datril,
Tylenol, Panadol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Nuprin, Motrin,Medipren); and a cough suppressant (dextromethor-phan). Common combination medications includeTylenol Cold and Flu, Triaminic, Sudafed Plus, andTavist D. Aspirin should not be given to children with a
cold because of its association with a risk of Reye’s syn-
drome , a serious disease.
Nasal sprays and nose drops are other products pro-
moted for reducing nasal congestion. These usually con-tain a decongestant, but the decongestant can act morequickly and strongly than ones found in pills or liquidsbecause it is applied directly in the nose. Congestionreturns after a few hours."
"People can become dependent on nasal sprays and
nose drops. If used for a long time, users may sufferwithdrawal symptoms when these products are discon-tinued. Nasal sprays and nose drops should not be usedfor more than a few days. Check the label for recommen-dations on length and frequency of use.
People react differently to different cold medications
and may find some more helpful than others. A medica-tion may be effective initially, then lose some of its effec-tiveness. Children sometimes react differently thanadults. Over-the-counter cold remedies should not begiven to infants without consulting a doctor first.Care should be taken not to exceed the recommend-"
"ed dosages, especially when combination medications ornasal sprays are taken. Individuals should determinewhether they wish to use any of these drugs. None ofthem shorten or cure a cold. At best they help a personfeel more comfortable. People who are confused aboutthe drugs in any over-the-counter cold remedies shouldask their pharmacist for an explanation.
In addition to the optional use of over the counter
cold remedies, there are some self-care steps that peoplecan take to ease their discomfort. These include:
• drinking plenty of fluids, but avoiding acidic juices,
which may irritate the throat
• gargling with warm salt water—made by adding one
teaspoon of salt to 8 oz of water—for a sore throat
• not smoking
• getting plenty of rest
• using a cool-mist room humidifier to ease congestion
and sore throat

"prevent irritation from frequent nose blowing
• for babies too young to blow their noses, the mucus

Alternative treatment
Alternative practitioners emphasize that people get
colds because their immune systems are weak. Theypoint out that everyone is exposed to cold viruses, but noteveryone gets every cold. The difference seems to be inthe ability of the immune system to fight infection. Pre-vention focuses on strengthening the immune system byeating a healthy diet low in sugars and high in fresh fruitsand vegetables, practicing meditation to reduce stress,
and getting regular moderate exercise .

"Description
Immunodeficiency means that the immune system is"
"deficient in one or more of its components and is unableto respond effectively. Common variable immunodefi-ciency is the most common of the immunodeficiency dis-orders. Patients with this disease have frequent infec-tions, especially those caused by the same microorgan-ism. Recurring infections are an indication that theimmune system is not responding normally and develop-ing immunity to reinfection. Patients with common vari-able immunodeficiency have a normal number of B cells,the lymphocytes that make antibodies. In approximatelyone-third of these patients, the number of B cells in theblood that have IgG antibodies on their surface is lowerthan normal, but there are normal numbers of B cells intheir bone marrow. B cells with IgG antibodies on theirsurface are capable of responding to microorganisms.The lack of IgG on the surface of the B cells means thatthey are not prepared to fight infection.

"Causes and symptoms
The cause of common variable immunodeficiency is
not known, although some forms seem to be hereditary.The main symptom is recurring infections that tend to bechronic rather than acute. Patients may also develop diar-
rhea and, as a consequence of the diarrhea, do not absorb
food efficiently. This can lead to malnourishment that canaggravate the disorder. Common variable immunodefi-ciency normally appears in children after the age of 10.Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis ,
thyroiditis , and systemic lupus erythematosus and cer-
tain cancers such as lymphomas and leukemias may beassociated with common variable immunodeficiency.

Treatment for common variable immunodeficiency aimsat boosting the body’s immune response and preventingor controlling infections. Immune serum, obtained fromdonated blood, is given as a source of antibodies to boostthe immune response. Immune serum is obtained fromdonated blood. It contains whatever antibodies thedonors had in their blood. Consequently, it may not con-tain all the antibodies that the patient needs and may lackantibodies specific for some of the recurring infectionsthat these patients suffer. Antibiotics are used routinely
at the first sign of an infection to help the patient elimi-nate infectious microorganisms.

Complement deficiencies are a group of disorders in
which there is a reduced level of specific proteins, com-plement, involved in proper immune functioning.

cells. Without sufficient complement, the body is proneto frequent infections, like pneumonia or meningitis ,o r
other illnesses, including autoimmune diseases, like sys-
temic lupus erythematosus . Since there are more than
20 different types of complement, the disease that resultsdepends on the specific complement that is lacking.

"Diagnosis
There are blood tests that determine the activity of the
complement system. The two most common screeningtests, CH50 and APH50, tell the physician which group ofcomplement components have a defect. More specificblood tests for the individual complement components(e.g., C3 or C4 complement) are then performed. Otherspecialized blood tests, including C1 esterase level, Hamtest, and a white blood count , may also be performed.
Treatment
There is no way to treat the actual complement defi-
ciency. However, antibiotics are used to treat infections
and vaccinations are given to reduce the risk of disease.Often, the person is vaccinated against infections thatinclude influenza , pneumonia, and meningitis. In some
cases, (e.g., a specific disease called paroxysmal noctur-nal hemoglobinuria [PNH]), a bone marrow transplantmay be recommended.

Prognosis
Since complement deficiencies include a wide range
of disorders, the prognoses can also vary widely. Somepatients remain healthy their entire life. Others are hospi-talized frequently because of infections which, if notproperly treated, can be fatal. Those with autoimmunediseases could have a normal life expectancy. There aresome complement deficiencies, that have a high mortali-ty rate. In those cases, death may occur within 10 years
after diagnosis.
Prevention
There is currently no way to prevent complement
deficiencies.

"Purpose
CT scans are used to image a wide variety of body
structures and internal organs. Since the 1990s, CTequipment has become more affordable and available. Insome diagnoses, CT scans have become the first imagingexam of choice. Because the computerized image is sosharp, focused, and three-dimensional, many tissues canbe better differentiated than on standard x rays. CommonCT indications include:
• Sinus studies. The CT scan can show details of sinusi-
tisand bone fractures . Physicians may order a CT of
the sinuses to provide an accurate map for surgery.
• Brain studies. Brain scans can detect hematomas,
tumors, and strokes. The introduction of CT scanning,especially spiral CT, has helped reduce the need for moreinvasive procedures such as cerebral angiography .
• Body scans. CT scans of the body will often be used
to observe abdominal organs, such as the liver, kid-neys, adrenal glands, spleen, and lymph nodes, andextremities.

"• Aorta scans. CT scans can focus on the thoracic or
abdominal aorta to locate aneurysms and other possibleaortic diseases.
• Chest scans. CT scans of the chest are useful in distin-

Precautions
Pregnant women or those who could possibly be
pregnant should not have a CT scan unless the diagnosticbenefits outweigh the risks. Pregnant patients should par-ticularly avoid full body or abdominal scans. If the examis necessary for obstetrics purposes, technologists areinstructed not to repeat films if there are errors. Pregnantpatients receiving CT or any x-ray exam away from theabdominal area may be protected by a lead apron; mostradiation, known as scatter, travels through the body andis not blocked by the apron.

"Contrast agents are often used in CT exams and the
use of these agents should be discussed with the medicalprofessional prior to the procedure. Patients should beasked to sign a consent form concerning the administra-tion of contrast. One of the common contrast agents,iodine, can cause allergic reactions. Patients who areknown to be allergic to iodine (or shellfish) shouldinform the physician prior to the CT scan.
Description
Computed tomography, also called CT scan, CAT
scan, or computerized axial tomography, is a combina-tion of focused x-ray beams and computerized produc-tion of an image. Introduced in the early 1970s, this radi-ologic procedure has advanced rapidly and is now widelyused, sometimes in the place of standard x rays.

"CT equipment
A CT scan may be performed in a hospital or outpa-
tient imaging center. Although the equipment looks largeand intimidating, it is very sophisticated and fairly com-fortable. The patient is asked to lie on a gantry, or narrowtable, that slides into the center of the scanner. The scan-ner looks like a doughnut and is round in the middle,which allows the x-ray beam to rotate around the patient.The scanner section may also be tilted slightly to allowfor certain cross-sectional angles.
CT procedure
The patient will feel the gantry move very slightly as
the precise adjustments for each sectional image are

"made. A technologist watches the procedure from a win-
dow and views the images on a computer screen.
It is essential that the patient lie very still during the
procedure to prevent motion blurring. In some studies,such as chest CTs, the patient will be asked to hold his orher breath during image capture.
Following the procedure, films of the images are
usually printed for the radiologist and referring physicianto review. A radiologist can also interpret CT exams on aspecial computer screen. The procedure time will vary inlength depending on the area being imaged. Averagestudy times are from 30 to 60 minutes. Some patientsmay be concerned about claustrophobia, but the width ofthe “doughnut” portion of the scanner is such that manypatients can be reassured of openness.

"The CT image
While traditional x rays image organs in two dimen-
sions, with the possibility that organs in the front of thebody are superimposed over those in the back, CT scansallow for a more three-dimensional effect. Some havecompared CT images to slices in a loaf of bread. Precisesections of the body can be located and imaged as cross-sectional views. The screen before the technologistshows a computer’s analysis of each section detected bythe x-ray beam. Thus, various densities of tissue can beeasily distinguished.
Contrast agents
Contrast agents are often used in CT exams and in
other radiology procedures to illuminate certain detailsof anatomy which may not be easily seen. Some con-trasts are natural, such as air or water. Other times, awater-based contrast agent is administered for specificdiagnostic purposes. Barium sulfate is commonly used ingastroenterology procedures. The patient may drink this"
"contrast, or receive it in an enema. Oral and rectal con-trast are usually given when examining the abdomen orcells, and not given when scanning the brain or chest.Iodine is the most widely used intravenous contrast agentand is given through an intravenous needle.
If contrast agents are used in the CT exam, these will
be administered several minutes before the study begins.Abdominal CT patients may be asked to drink a contrastmedium. Some patients may experience a salty taste, flush-ing of the face, warmth or slight nausea, or hives from an
intravenous contrast injection. Technologists and radiolo-gists have equipment and training to help patients throughthese minor reactions and to handle more severe reactions.Severe reactions to contrast are rare, but do occur.

"Spiral CT
Spiral CT, also called helical CT, is a newer version
of CT scanning which is continuous in motion andallows for three-dimensional recreation of images. Forexample, traditional CT allows the technologist to takeslices at very small and precise intervals one after theother. Spiral CT allows for a continuous flow of images,without stopping the scanner to move to the next imageslice. A major advantage of spiral CT is the ability toreconstruct images anywhere along the length of thestudy area. The procedure also speeds up the imagingprocess, meaning less time for the patient to lie still. Theability to image contrast more rapidly after it is injected,when it is at its highest level, is another advantage of spi-ral CT’s high speed.

"Some facilities will have both spiral and convention-
al CT available. Although spiral is more advantageousfor many applications, conventional CT is still a superiorand precise method for imaging many tissues and struc-tures. The physician will evaluate which type of CTworks best for the specific exam purpose.
Preparation
If a contrast medium is administered, the patient
may be asked to fast from about four to six hours prior tothe procedure. Patients will usually be given a gown (likea typical hospital gown) to be worn during the procedure.All metal and jewelry should be removed to avoid arti-facts on the film.
Aftercare
No aftercare is generally required following a CT
scan. Immediately following the exam, the technologistwill continue to watch the patient for possible adversecontrast reactions. Patients are instructed to advise the

difficulty. The site of contrast injection will be bandagedand may feel tender following the exam. Hives maydevelop later and usually do not require treatment.
Risks
Radiation exposure from a CT scan is similar to,
though higher than, that of a conventional x ray.Although this is a risk to pregnant women, the exposureto other adults is minimal and should produce no effects.Although severe contrast reactions are rare, they are arisk of many CT procedures.

"Normal results
Normal findings on a CT exam show bone, the most
dense tissue, as white areas. Tissues and fat will show asvarious shades of gray, and fluids will be gray or black.Air will also look black. Intravenous, oral, and rectal con-trast appear as white areas. The radiologist can determineif tissues and organs appear normal by the sensitivity ofthe gray shadows. In CT, the images that can cut througha section of tissue or organ provide three-dimensionalviewing for the radiologist and referring physician.
Abnormal results
Abnormal results may show different characteristics
of tissues within organs. Accumulations of blood or otherfluids where they do not belong may be detected. Radiol-ogists can differentiate among types of tumors through-out the body by viewing details of their makeup.

"Sinus studies
The increasing availability and lowered cost of CT
scanning has led to its increased use in sinus studies,either as a replacement for a sinus x ray or as a follow-upto an abnormal sinus radiograph. The sensitivity of CTallows for location of areas of sinus infection, particularlychronic infection. CT scans can show the extent and loca-tion of tiny fractures to the sinus and nasal bones. Foreignbodies in the sinus and nasal area are also easily detectedby CT. CT imaging of the sinuses is important in evaluat-ing trauma or disease of the sphenoid bone (the wedgeshaped bone at the base of the skull). Sinus tumors willshow as shades of gray indicating the difference in theirdensity from that of normal tissues in the area.
Brain studies
The precise differences in density allowed by CT scan
can clearly show tumors, strokes, or lesions in the brain areaas altered densities. These lighter or darker areas on theimage may indicate a tumor or hematoma within the brain"
"and skull area. Different types of tumors can be identifiedby the presence of edema , by the tissue’s density, or by
studying blood vessel location and activity. The speed andconvenience of CT often allows for detection of hemorrhagebefore symptoms even occur. Congenital abnormalities inchildren, such as hydrocephalus , may also be confirmed
with CT. Hydrocephalus is suggested by enlargement of thefluid structures called ventricles of the brain.
Body scans
The body scan can identify abnormal body structures
and organs. Throughout the body, a CT may indicatetumors or cysts, enlarged lymph nodes, abnormal collec-tions of fluids, blood or fat, and metastasis of cancer ."
"Tumors resulting from metastasis are different in makeupthan primary tumors, or those that originate in the loca-tion of study. Fractures or damage to soft tissues and liga-ments will be more easily seen on the sensitive imagesproduced by CT scanning, though CT is not usually donefor these. Liver conditions, such as cirrhosis or abscessed
or fatty liver , may be observed on the body scan.
CT of the aorta
CT provides the ability to see and measure the thick-
ness of the aortal wall, which is very helpful in diagnos-ing aortic aneurysms. The use of contrast will help seedetails within the aorta. In addition, density can identifycalcification, and this helps differentiate between acuteand chronic problems. An abnormal CT scan may indi-cate signs of aortic clots. Aortic rupture is suggested bysigns such as a hematoma around the aorta or the escapeof blood from its cavity.

"Chest scans
In addition to those findings that may indicate aortic
aneurysms, chest CT studies can show other problems inthe heart and lungs, and distinguish between an aortic
aneurysm and a tumor adjacent to the aorta. The com-
puter will not only show differences between air, water,tissues, and bone, but will also assign numerical valuesto the various densities. Coin-sized lesions in the lungsmay be indicative of tuberculosis or tumors. CT will
help distinguish among the two. Enlarged lymph nodesin the chest area may indicate Hodgkin’s disease . Spiral
CT is particularly effective at identifying pulmonaryemboli (clots in the lung’s blood vessels).

status, with confusion and amnesia , and with or without
a brief loss of consciousness.

"a brief loss of consciousness.
Description
A concussion occurs when the head hits or is hit by
an object, or when the brain is jarred against the skull,with sufficient force to cause temporary loss of functionin the higher centers of the brain. The injured person mayremain conscious or lose consciousness briefly, and isdisoriented for some minutes after the blow. Accordingto the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,approximately 300,000 people sustain mild to moderatesports-related brain injuries each year, most of themyoung men between 16 and 25.

"While concussion usually resolves on its own with-
out lasting effect, it can set the stage for a much moreserious condition. “Second impact syndrome” occurswhen a person with a concussion, even a very mild one,suffers a second blow before fully recovering from thefirst. The brain swelling and increased intracranial pres-sure that can result is potentially fatal. More than 20 suchcases have been reported since the syndrome was firstdescribed in 1984.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
Most concussions are caused by motor vehicle acci-
dents and sports injuries . In motor vehicle accidents,
concussion can occur without an actual blow to the head.Instead, concussion occurs because the skull suddenlydecelerates or stops, which causes the brain to be jarredagainst the skull. Contact sports, especially football,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 878ConcussionGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 878"
"hockey, and boxing, are among those most likely to lead
to concussion. Other significant causes include falls, col-lisions, or blows due to bicycling, horseback riding, ski-ing, and soccer.
The risk of concussion from football is extremely
high, especially at the high school level. Studies showthat approximately one in five players suffer concussionor more serious brain injury during their brief high-school careers. The rate at the collegiate level is approxi-mately 1 in 20. Rates for hockey players are not knownas certainly, but are believed to be similar.
Concussion and lasting brain damage is an especial-
ly significant risk for boxers, since the goal of the sportis, in fact, to deliver a concussion to the opponent. Forthis reason, the American Academy of Neurology hascalled for a ban on boxing. Repeated concussions overmonths or years can cause cumulative head injury . The"
"cumulative brain injuries suffered by most boxers canlead to permanent brain damage. Multiple blows to thehead can cause “punch-drunk” syndrome or dementia
pugilistica, as evidenced by Muhammed Ali, whoseparkinsonism is a result of his career in the ring.
Young children are likely to suffer concussions from
falls or collisions on the playground or around the home.Child abuse is, unfortunately, another common cause of
concussion.
Symptoms
Symptoms of concussion include:
• headache
• disorientation as to time, date, or place• confusion
• dizziness
• vacant stare or confused expression• incoherent or incomprehensible speech
• incoordination or weakness
• amnesia for the events immediately preceding the blow
• nausea or vomiting

"• double vision• ringing in the ears
These symptoms may last from several minutes to
several hours. More severe or longer-lasting symptomsmay indicate more severe brain injury. The person with aconcussion may or may not lose consciousness from theblow; if so, it will be for several minutes at the most.More prolonged unconsciousness indicates more severebrain injury.
The severity of concussion is graded on a three-point
scale, used as a basis for treatment decisions.KEY TERMS
Amnesia —A loss of memory that may be caused
by brain injury, such as concussion.
Parkinsonism —A neurological disorder that
includes a fine tremor, muscular weakness andrigidity, and an altered way of walking.
• Grade 1: no loss of consciousness, transient confusion,
and other symptoms that resolve within 15 minutes.
• Grade 2: no loss of consciousness, transient confusion,
and other symptoms that require more than 15 minutesto resolve.
• Grade 3: loss of consciousness for any period."
"• Grade 3: loss of consciousness for any period.
Days or weeks after the accident, the person may
show signs of:
• headache
• poor attention and concentration
• memory difficulties
• anxiety• depression• sleep disturbances• light and noise intolerance
The occurrence of such symptoms is called “post-
concussion syndrome.”
Diagnosis
It is very important for those attending a person with
concussion to pay close attention to the person’s symp-toms and progression immediately after the accident. Theduration of unconsciousness and degree of confusion arevery important indicators of the severity of the injury andhelp guide the diagnostic process and treatment decisions.
A doctor, nurse, or emergency medical technician
may make an immediate assessment based on the severi-ty of the symptoms; a neurologic exam of the pupils,"
"coordination, and sensation; and brief tests of orienta-tion, memory, and concentration. Those with very mildconcussions may not need to be hospitalized or haveexpensive diagnostic tests. Questionable or more severecases may require computed tomography scan (CT) or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to look for
brain injury.
Treatment
The symptoms of concussion usually clear quickly
and without lasting effect, if no further injury is sus-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 879ConcussionGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 879"
"tained during the healing process. Guidelines for return-
ing to sports activities are based on the severity of theconcussion.
A grade 1 concussion can usually be treated with
rest and continued observation alone. The person mayreturn to sports activities that same day, but only afterexamination by a trained professional, and after allsymptoms have completely resolved. If the person sus-tains a second concussion of any severity that same day,he or she should not be allowed to continue contactsports until he or she has been symptom-free, duringboth rest and activity, for one week.
A person with a grade 2 concussion must discontin-"
"A person with a grade 2 concussion must discontin-
ue sports activity for the day, should be evaluated by atrained professional, and should be observed closelythroughout the day to make sure that all symptoms havecompletely cleared. Worsening of symptoms, or continu-ation of any symptoms beyond one week, indicates theneed for a CT or MRI scan. Return to contact sportsshould only occur after one week with no symptoms,both at rest and during activity, and following examina-tion by a physician. Following a second grade 2 concus-sion, the person should remain symptom-free for twoweeks before resuming contact sports.
A person with a grade 3 concussion (involving any"
"loss of consciousness, no matter how brief) should beexamined by a medical professional either on the scene orin an emergency room. More severe symptoms may war-rant a CT or MRI scan, along with a thorough neurologicaland physical exam. The person should be hospitalized ifany abnormalities are found or if confusion persists. Pro-longed unconsciousness and worsening symptoms requireurgent neurosurgical evaluation or transfer to a trauma cen-ter. Following discharge from professional care, the patientis closely monitored for neurological symptoms which mayarise or worsen. If headaches or other symptoms worsen orlast longer than one week, a CT or MRI scan should be per-formed. Contact sports are avoided for one week followingunconsciousness of only seconds, and for two weeks forunconsciousness of a minute or more. A person receiving asecond grade 3 concussion should avoid contact sports forat least a month after all symptoms have cleared, and thenonly with the approval of a physician. If"
"least a month after all symptoms have cleared, and thenonly with the approval of a physician. If signs of brainswelling or bleeding are seen on a CT or MRI scan, the ath-lete should not return to the sport for the rest of the season,or even indefinitely."
"For someone who has sustained a concussion of any
severity, it is critically important that he or she avoid thepossibility of another blow to the head until well after allsymptoms have cleared to prevent second-impact syn-drome. The guidelines above are designed to minimizethe risk of this syndrome.Prognosis
Concussion usually leaves no lasting neurological
problems. Nonetheless, symptoms of post-concussion
syndrome may last for weeks or even months.
Studies of concussion in contact sports have shown
that the risk of sustaining a second concussion is evengreater than it was for the first if the person continues toengage in the sport.
Prevention

"Prevention
Many cases of concussion can be prevented by using
appropriate protective equipment. This includes seatbelts and air bags in automobiles, and helmets in all con-tact sports. Helmets should also be worn when bicycling,skiing, or horseback riding. Soccer players should avoidheading the ball when it is kicked at high velocity fromclose range. Playground equipment should be underlaidwith soft material, either sand or special matting.
The value of high-contact sports such as boxing,
football, or hockey should be weighed against the highrisk of brain injury during a young person’s participationin the sport. Steering a child’s general enthusiasm forsports into activities less apt to produce head impactsmay reduce the likelihood of brain injury.

Condom
Definition
Male condoms are thin sheaths of latex (rubber),
polyurethane (plastic), or animal tissue that are rolled ontoan erect penis immediately prior to intercourse. They arecommonly called “safes” or “rubbers.” Female condomsare made of polyurethane and are inserted into the vaginal
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 880CondomGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 880"
"canal before sexual relations. The open end covers the out-
side of the vagina, and the closed ring fits over the cervix(opening into the uterus). Both types of condoms collectthe male semen at ejaculation, acting as a barrier to fertil-ization. Condoms also perform as barriers to the exchangeof bodily fluids and are subsequently an important tool inthe prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
Purpose
Both male and female condoms are used to prevent
pregnancy and to protect against STDs such as human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), gonorrhea , chlamydia,
and syphilis . To accomplish these goals, the condom
must be applied and removed correctly.
Precautions
Male and female condoms should not be used togeth-
er as there is a risk that one of them may come off. Themale condom should not be snug on the tip of the penis. A"
"space of about 0.5 in should be left at the end to avoid thepossibility of it breaking during sexual intercourse. Thepenis must be withdrawn quickly after ejaculation to pre-vent the condom from falling off as the penis softens. Thecondom should therefore always be removed while thepenis is still erect to prevent the sperm from spilling intothe vagina.
Description
Male condoms made from animal tissue and linen
have been in use for centuries. Latex condoms wereintroduced in the late 1800s and gained immediate pop-ularity because they were inexpensive and effective. Atthat time, they were primarily used to protect againstSTDs. A common complaint made by many consumersis that condoms reduce penis sensitivity and impairorgasm. Both men and women may develop allergies to

"the latex. Consumer interest in female condoms has
been slight.
Male condoms may be purchased lubricated, ribbed,
or treated with spermicide (a chemical that kills sperm).To be effective, condoms must be removed carefully soas not to “spill” the contents into the vaginal canal. Con-doms that leak or break do not provide protection againstpregnancy or disease.
If used correctly, male condoms have an effective-
ness rate of about 90% for preventing pregnancy, butthis rate can be increased to about 99% if used with aspermicide. (Several types of spermicides are available;they can be purchased in the form of contraceptivecreams and jellies, foams, or films.) Benefits associatedwith this type of contraceptive device include easy avail-ability (no prescription is required), convenience of use,and lack of serious side effects. The primary disadvan-tage is that sexual activity must be interrupted in orderto put the condom on.

"Female condoms, when used correctly and at every
instance of intercourse, were shown to prevent pregnancyin over 95% of women surveyed over the course of sixmonths. When used inconsistently, the female condomwas shown to have a failure rate of 21% in the samestudy. One benefit of the female condom is that it may beinserted immediately before sexual intercourse or up toeight hours prior, so that sexual activity does not need tobe interrupted for its insertion. One study performed by amanufacturer of the female condom indicated that50–75% of couples in numerous countries found the bar-rier acceptable for use.
Condoms provide better protection against STDs
than any other contraceptive method. One study conduct-ed in the 1990s indicated that out of 123 couples withone HIV-positive partner, not one healthy individual con-KEY TERMS

Conduct disorder
Definition
Conduct disorder (CD) is a behavioral and emotion-
al disorder of childhood and adolescence. Children withconduct disorder act inappropriately, infringe on therights of others, and violate the behavioral expectationsof others.
Description
CD is present in approximately 9% of boys and
2–9% of girls under the age of 18. Children with con-duct disorder act out aggressively and express angerinappropriately. They engage in a variety of antisocialand destructive acts, including violence towards peopleand animals, destruction of property, lying, stealing,

"truancy, and running away from home. They often
begin using and abusing drugs and alcohol, and havingsex at an early age. Irritability, temper tantrums, andlow self-esteem are common personality traits of chil-dren with CD.
Causes and symptoms
There are two sub-types of CD, one beginning in
childhood and the other in adolescence. There is noknown cause. Researchers and physicians suggest thatthis disease may be caused by the following:
• poor parent-child relationships• dysfunctional families• drug abuse• physical abuse• poor relationships with other children• cognitive problems leading to school failures• brain damage• biological defects

"Difficulty in school is an early sign of potential con-
duct disorder problems. While the patient’s IQ tends tobe in the normal range, they can have trouble with verbaland abstract reasoning skills and may lag behind theirclassmates, and consequently, feel as if they don’t “fitin.” The frustration and loss of self-esteem resulting fromthis academic and social inadequacy can trigger thedevelopment of CD.
A dysfunctional home environment can be another
major contributor to CD. An emotionally, physically, orsexually abusive home environment, a family history ofantisocial personality disorder, or parental substanceabuse can damage a child’s perceptions of himself andput him on a path toward negative behavior. Other lessobvious environmental factors can also play a part in thedevelopment of conduct disorder. Long-term studieshave shown that maternal smoking during pregnancy"
"may be linked to the development of CD in boys. Ani-mal and human studies point out that nicotine can haveundesirable effects on babies. These include alteredstructure and function of their nervous systems, learningdeficits, and behavioral problems. In a study of 177 boysages seven-12 years, those with mothers who smokedover one half a package of cigarettes daily while preg-nant were more apt to have a CD than those with moth-ers who did not smoke.
Other conditions that may cause or co-exist with CD
include head injury , substance abuse disorder, major
depressive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder ( ADHD ). Thirty to fifty percent of childrendiagnosed with ADHD, a disorder characterized by a
persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity, alsohave CD.

CD is diagnosed and treated by a number of social
workers, school counselors, psychiatrists, and psycholo-gists. Genuine diagnosis may require psychiatric exper-tise to rule out such conditions as bipolar disorder or
ADHD. A comprehensive evaluation of the child shouldideally include interviews with the child and parents, afull social and medical history, a cognitive evaluation,and a psychiatric exam. One or more clinical inventoriesor scales may be used to assess the child for conduct dis-order—including the Youth Self-Report, the OvertAggression Scale (OAS), Behavioral Assessment Sys-tem for Children (BASC), Child Behavior Checklist(CBCL), and Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Chil-dren (DISC). The tests are verbal and/or written and areadministered in both hospital and outpatient settings."

"Treatment
Treating conduct disorder requires an approach that
addresses both the child and his environment. Behavioraltherapy and psychotherapy can help a child with CD tocontrol his anger and develop new coping skills. Familygroup therapy may also be effective in some cases. Par-
ents should be counseled on how to set appropriate limitswith their child and be consistent and realistic when dis-ciplining. If an abusive home life is at the root of the con-duct problem, every effort should be made to move thechild into a more supportive environment. Parent trainingprograms are increasing in number.
For children with coexisting ADHD, substance
abuse, depression, or learning disorders , treating these
conditions first is preferred, and may result in a signifi-cant improvement to the CD condition. In all cases ofCD, treatment should begin when symptoms first appear.Recent studies have shown Ritalin to be a useful drug forboth ADHD and CD.

"When aggressive behavior is severe, mood stabi-
lizing medication, including lithium (Cibalith-S,Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid, Lithonate, Lithotabs), car-bamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol), and propranolol(Inderal), may be an appropriate option for treating theaggressive symptoms. However, placing the child intoa structured setting or treatment program such as a psy-chiatric hospital may be just as beneficial for easingaggression as medication.
Prognosis
The prognosis for children with CD is not bright.
Follow-up studies of conduct disordered children haveshown a high incidence of antisocial personality disor-der, affective illnesses, and chronic criminal behaviorlater in life. However, proper treatment of co-existingdisorders, early identification and intervention, andlong-term support may improve the outlook signifi-cantly.KEY TERMS

Addressing these problems when they firstappear helps to prevent the frustration and low self-esteem that may lead to CD later on.

"hormone androgen, which is present at birth and affects
sexual development.
Description
CAH is a form of adrenal insufficiency in which the
enzyme that produces two important adrenal steroid hor-mones, cortisol and aldosterone, is deficient. Becausecortisol production is impeded, the adrenal gland insteadoverproduces androgens (male steroid hormones).Females with CAH are born with an enlarged clitoris andnormal internal reproductive tract structures. Males havenormal genitals at birth. CAH causes abnormal growthfor both sexes; patients will be tall as children and shortas adults. Females develop male characteristics, andmales experience premature sexual development.
In its most severe form, called salt-wasting CAH, a
life-threatening adrenal crisis can occur if the disorderis untreated. Adrenal crisis can cause dehydration ,
shock , and death within 14 days of birth. There is also"
"shock , and death within 14 days of birth. There is also
a mild form of CAH that occurs later in childhood oryoung adult life in which patients have partial enzymedeficiency.
CAH, a genetic disorder, is the most common adren-
al gland disorder in infants and children, occurring in onein 10,000 total births worldwide. It affects both femalesand males. It is also called adrenogenital syndrome.
Causes and symptoms
CAH is an inherited disorder. It is a recessive dis-
ease, which means that a child must inherit one copy ofthe defective gene from each parent who is a carrier;when two carriers have children, each pregnancy carries
a 25% risk of producing an affected child.
In females, CAH produces an enlarged clitoris at
birth and masculinization of features as the child grows,such as deepening of the voice, facial hair, and failure tomenstruate or abnormal periods at puberty . Females"
"with severe CAH may be mistaken for males at birth. Inmales, the genitals are normal at birth, but the childbecomes muscular, the penis enlarges, pubic hairappears, and the voice deepens long before normalpuberty, sometimes as early as two to three years of age.
In the severe salt-wasting form of CAH, newborns
may develop symptoms shortly after birth, includingvomiting, dehydration, electrolyte (a compound such assodium or calcium that separates to form ions when dis-solved in water) changes, and cardiac arrhythmia.
In the mild form of CAH, which occurs in late child-
hood or early adulthood, symptoms include prematuredevelopment of pubic hair, irregular menstrual periods,unwanted body hair, or severe acne . However, some-
times there are no symptoms.
Diagnosis
CAH is diagnosed by a careful examination of the"
"times there are no symptoms.
Diagnosis
CAH is diagnosed by a careful examination of the
genitals and blood and urine tests that measure the hor-mones produced by the adrenal gland. A number ofstates in the United States perform a hormonal test (aheel prick blood test) for CAH and other inherited dis-eases within a few days of birth. In questionable cases,genetic testing can provide a definitive diagnosis. For
some forms of CAH, prenatal diagnosis is possiblethrough chronic villus sampling in the first trimester andby measuring certain hormones in the amniotic fluidduring the second trimester.
Treatment
The goal of treatment for CAH is to return the
androgen levels to normal. This is usually accomplishedthrough drug therapy, although surgery is an alternative.Lifelong treatment is required.
Drug therapy consists of a cortisol-like steroid med-"
"Drug therapy consists of a cortisol-like steroid med-
ication called a glucocorticoid. Oral hydrocortisone isprescribed for children, and prednisone or dexametha-sone is prescribed for older patients. For patients withsalt-wasting CAH, fludrocortisone, which acts likealdosterone (the missing hormone), is also prescribed.Infants and small children may also receive salt tablets,while older patients are told to eat salty foods. Medicaltherapy achieves hormonal balance most of the time, butCAH patients can have periods of fluctuating hormonalcontrol that lead to increases in the dose of steroids pre-scribed. Side effects of steroids include stunted growth.Steroid therapy should not be suddenly stopped, sinceadrenal insufficiency results.
Patients with CAH should see a pediatric endocrinol-
ogist frequently. The endocrinologist will assess height,

"weight, and blood pressure, and order an annual x ray of
the wrist (to assess bone age), as well as assess blood hor-mone levels. CAH patients with the milder form of thedisorder are usually effectively treated with hydrocorti-sone or prednisone, if they need medical treatment at all.
Females with CAH who have masculine external
genitalia require surgery to reconstruct the clitoris and/orvagina. This is usually performed between the ages ofone and three.
An experimental type of drug therapy—a three-drug
combination, with an androgen blocking agent (flu-tamide), an aromatase inhibitor (testolactone), and lowdose hydrocortisone—is currently being studied byphysicians at the National Institutes of Health. Prelimi-nary results are encouraging, but it will be many yearsbefore the safety and effectiveness of this therapy isfully known.

Thistherapy is started in the first trimester when fetal adrenalproduction of androgens begins, but before prenatal diag-nosis is done that would provide definitive informationabout the sex of the fetus and its disease status. Thismeans that a number of fetuses are exposed to unneces-sary steroid treatment in order to prevent the develop-ment of male-like genitals in female fetuses with CAH.Several hundred children have undergone this treatmentwith no major adverse effects, but its long-term risks areunknown. Since there is very little data on the effective-ness and safety of prenatal therapy, it should only beoffered to patients who clearly understand the risks andbenefits and who are capable of complying with strictmonitoring and follow-up throughout pregnancy andafter the child is born."
"Parents with a family history of CAH, including a
child who has CAH, should seek genetic counseling .
Genetic testing during pregnancy can provide informa-tion on the risk of having a child with CAH.

Congenital amputation
Definition
Congenital amputation is the absence of a fetal
limb or fetal part at birth. This condition may be theresult of the constriction of fibrous bands within themembrane that surrounds the developing fetus (amnioticband syndrome) or the exposure to substances known tocause birth defects (teratogenic agents). Other factors,
including genetics, may also play a role.

An estimated one in 2,000 babies are born with all
or part of a limb missing, ranging from a missing part ofa finger to the absence of both arms and both legs. Con-genital amputation is the least common reason foramputation. However, there are occasional periods inhistory where the number of congenital amputationsincreased. For example, the thalidomide tragedy of theearly 1960s occurred after pregnant mothers in westernEurope were given a tranquilizer containing the drug.The result was a drastic increase in the number of babiesborn with deformed limbs. In this example, the birthdefect usually presented itself as very small, deformedversions of normal limbs. More recently, birth defects asa result of radiation exposure near the site of the Cher-nobyl disaster in Russia have left numerous childrenwith malformed or absent limbs.

"Causes and symptoms
The exact cause of congenital amputations is
unknown. However, according to the March of Dimes,most birth defects have one or more genetic factors andone or more environmental factors. It is also known thatmost birth defects occur in the first three months of preg-
nancy , when the organs of the fetus are forming. Within
these crucial first weeks, frequently prior to when awoman is aware of the pregnancy, the developing fetus ismost susceptible to substances that can cause birthdefects (teratogens). Exposure to teratogens can causecongenital amputation. In other cases, tight amnioticbands may constrict the developing fetus, preventing alimb from forming properly, if at all. It is estimated thatthis amniotic band syndrome occurs in between one in12,000 and one in 15,000 live births.

"An infant with congenital amputation may be miss-

Longitudinal deficien-cies occur when a specific part of a limb is missing; forexample, when the fibula bone in the lower leg is miss-ing, but the rest of the leg is intact. Phocomelia is thecondition in which only a mid-portion of a limb is miss-ing, as when the hands or feet are attached directly tothe trunk.

Many cases of congenital amputation are not diag-

"Treatment
Successful treatment of a child with congenital
amputation involves an entire medical team, including apediatrician, an orthopedist, a psychiatrist or psycholo-gist, a prosthetist (an expert in making prosthetics, orartificial limbs), a social worker, and occupational andphysical therapists. The accepted method of treatment isto fit the child early with a functional prosthesis becausethis leads to normal development and less wasting away(atrophy) of the muscles of the limbs present. However,some parents and physicians believe that the child shouldbe allowed to learn to play and perform tasks without aprosthesis, if possible. When the child is older, he or shecan be involved in the decision of whether or not to befitted for a prosthesis.

have detected amniotic band constriction interfering withlimb development fairly early in its course. In 1997, doc-tors at the Florida Institute for Fetal Diagnosis and Ther-apy reported two cases in which minimally invasivesurgery freed constricting amniotic bands and preservedthe affected limbs.

understands both her genetic risks and her environmentalrisks. Several disciplines in alternative therapy also rec-ommend various supplements and vitamins that may
reduce the chances of birth defects. If a surgical proce-dure is planned, naturopathic and homeopathic pre- andpost-surgical therapies can speed recovery.

A congenital limb deficiency has a profound effect
on the life of the child and parents. However, occupation-al therapy can help the child learn to accomplish manytasks. In addition, some experts believe that early fittingof a prosthesis will enhance acceptance of the prosthesisby the child and parents.

"Definition
The two most common congenital bladder abnor-
malities are exstrophy and congenital diverticula. Anexstrophic bladder is one that is open to the outside andturned inside-out, so that its inside is visible at birth, pro-truding from the lower abdomen. A diverticulum is anextension of a hollow organ, usually shaped like a pouchwith a narrow opening.
Description
During fetal development, folds enclose tissues and
organs and eventually fuse at the edges to form sealedcompartments. Both in the front and the back, foldseventually become major body structures. In the back,the entire spinal column folds in like a pipe wrapped in apillow. In the front, the entire lower urinary system isfolded in.

"• Exstrophy of the bladder represents a failure of this
folding process to complete itself, so the organs formwith more or less of their front side missing and open tothe outside. At the same time, the front of the pelvicbone is widely separated. The abdominal wall is open,too. In fact, the defect often extends all the way to thepenis in the male or splits the clitoris in the female.

Bladder diverticula may be multi-ple, and they often occur at the ureterovesical junc-tion—the entrance of the upper urinary system into thebladder. In this location, they may cause urine to refluxinto the ureter and kidney, leading to infection and pos-sible kidney damage.

"Causes and symptoms
As with many birth defects , the causes are not well
known. Lack of prenatal care and nutrition has been
linked to many birth defects; however, beyond the avoid-ance of known teratogens (anything that can cause a birthdefect), there is little prevention possible. Exstrophy israre, occurring in about one in 40,000 births. Diverticulaare more common, but less serious.
If left untreated, the patient with bladder exstrophy
will have no control over urination and is more likely todevelop bladder cancer . Diverticula, particularly if it
causes urine reflux, may lead to chronic infection and itssubsequent consequences.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 888Congenital bladder anomaliesGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 888"
"Diagnosis
A major consideration with congenital abnormali-
ties is that they tend to be multiple. Further, each oneis unique in its extent and severity. Exstrophy caninvolve the rectum and large bowel and coexist withhernias. The obvious bladder exstrophy seen at birthwill prompt immediate action and a search for otheranomalies.
Diverticula are not visible and will be detected only
if they cause trouble. They are usually found in anexamination for the cause of recurring urinary infec-tions. X rays of the urinary system or a cystoscopy
(examination with a telescope-like instrument) willidentify them. Often, the two procedures are donetogether: a urologist will perform the cystoscopy, then aradiologist will instill a contrast agent into the bladderand take x rays.

"Treatment
Surgery is necessary and can usually produce suc-
cessful results. If possible, the surgery must be donewithin 48 hours of birth. Prior to surgery, the exposedorgans must be protected and all related defects identi-fied and managed. Delay in the surgery leads to thefrequent need to divert the urine into the bowelbecause the partially repaired bladder cannot controlthe flow. After surgery, the likelihood of infectionrequires monitoring.
Alternative treatment
After surgery ongoing precautions to reduce fre-
quency of infection may need to be used. Cranberryjuice has the ability to keep bacteria from adhering tothe membranes and can help prevent infection when-ever there is increased risk. There are botanical andhomeopathic treatments available, however consulta-tion by a trained practitioner is recommended beforetreatment.

"Prognosis
With immediate surgery, three-quarters of patients
can be successfully repaired. They will have control oftheir urine and no long-term consequences. The rate ofinfection is greater for those with congenital bladderanomalies, since any abnormality in the urinary systempredisposes it to invasion by bacteria.

"plex genetic program coordinates the formation, growth,
and migration of billions of neurons, or nerve cells, andtheir development into discrete, interacting brainregions. Interruption of this program, especially early indevelopment, can cause structural defects in the brain.In addition, normal brain formation requires properdevelopment of the surrounding skull, and skull defectsmay lead to brain malformation. Congenital braindefects may be caused by inherited genetic defects,spontaneous mutations within the genes of the embryo,or effects on the embryo due to the mother’s infection,trauma, or drug use.
Early on in development, a flat strip of tissue"
"Early on in development, a flat strip of tissue
along the back of the fetus rolls up to form a tube. Thisso-called “neural tube” develops into the spinal cord,and at one end, the brain. Closure of the tube isrequired for subsequent development of the tissuewithin. Anencephaly (literally “without brain”), resultswhen the topmost portion of the tube fails to close.Anencephaly is the most common severe malformationseen in stillborn births. It is about four times morecommon in females than males. Anencephaly is some-times seen to run in families, and for parents who haveconceived one anencephalic fetus, the risk of a secondis as high as 5%. Fewer than half of babies with anen-cephaly are born alive, and survival beyond the firstmonth is rare.
Encephalocele is a protrusion of part of the brain"
"Encephalocele is a protrusion of part of the brain
through a defect in the skull. The most common site forencephalocele is along the front-to-back midline of theskull, usually at the rear, although frontal encephalocelesare more common among Asians. Pressure within theskull pushes out cranial tissue. The protective layer overthe brain, the meninges, grows to cover the protrusion, asdoes skin in some cases. Defects in skull closure arethought to cause some cases of encephalocele, whiledefects in neural tube closure may cause others.Encephaloceles may be small and contain little or nobrain tissue, or may be quite large and contain a signifi-cant fraction of the brain.
Failure of neural-tube closure below the level of
the brain prevents full development of the surroundingvertebral bones and leads to spina bifida , or a divided"
"spinal column. Incomplete closure causes protrusionof the spinal cord and meninges, called meningomye-locele. Some cases of spina bifida are accompanied byanother defect at the base of the brain, known as theArnold-Chiari malformation or Chiari II malforma-tion. For reasons that are unclear, part of the cerebel-lum is displaced downward into the spinal column.Symptoms may be present at birth or delayed untilearly childhood.The Dandy-Walker malformation is marked by
incomplete formation, or absence of, the central sectionof the cerebellum, and the growth of cysts within thelowest of the brain’s ventricles. The ventricles are fluid-filled cavities within the brain, through which cere-brospinal fluid (CSF) normally circulates. The cystsmay block the exit of the fluid, causing hydrocephalus .
Symptoms may be present at birth or delayed until earlychildhood.
Soon after closure of the neural tube, the brain"
"Soon after closure of the neural tube, the brain
divides into two halves, or hemispheres. Failure of divi-sion is termed holoprosencephaly (literally “wholeforebrain”). Holoprosencephaly is almost alwaysaccompanied by facial and cranial deformities along themidline, including cleft lip, cleft palate, fused eye sock-ets and a single eye (cyclopia), and deformities of thelimbs, heart, gastrointestinal tract, and other internalorgans. Most infants are either stillborn or die soonafter birth. Survivors suffer from severe neurologicalimpairments.
The normal ridges and valleys of the mature brain
are formed after cells from the inside of the developingbrain migrate to the outside and multiply. When thesecells fail to migrate, the surface remains smooth, a con-dition called lissencephaly (“smooth brain”). Lissen-cephaly is often associated with facial abnormalitiesincluding a small jaw, a high forehead, a short nose, andlow-set ears.

"If damaged during growth, especially within the
first 20 weeks, brain tissue may stop growing, whiletissue around it continues to form. This causes anabnormal cleft or groove to appear on the surface ofthe brain, called schizencephaly (literally “splitbrain”). This cleft should not be confused with the nor-mal wrinkled brain surface, nor should the name bemistaken for schizophrenia , a mental disorder. Gener-
alized destruction of tissue or lack of brain develop-ment may lead to hydranencephaly, in which cere-brospinal fluid fills much of the space normally occu-pied by the brain. Hydranencephaly is distinct fromhydrocephalus, in which CSF accumulates within anormally-formed brain, putting pressure on it and pos-sibly causing skull expansion.

"Excessive brain size is termed megalencephaly (lit-

"Causes and symptoms
Causes
Congenital brain defects may have genetic, infec-
tious, toxic, or traumatic causes. In most cases, no certaincause can be identified.
GENETIC CAUSES. Some brain defects are caused by
trisomy, the inclusion of a third copy of a chromosomenormally occurring in pairs. Most trisomies occurbecause of improper division of the chromosomes duringformation of eggs or sperm. Trisomy of chromosome 9can cause some cases of Dandy-Walker and Chiari IImalformation. Some cases of holoprosencephaly arecaused by trisomy of chromosome 13, while others aredue to abnormalities in chromosomes 7 or 18. Individualgene defects, either inherited or spontaneous, are respon-sible for other cases of congenital brain malformations.
DRUGS. Drugs known to cause congenital brain
defects when used by the mother during critical develop-mental periods include:
• anticonvulsant drugs
• retinoic acid and tretinoin• warfarin• alcohol
• cocaine

"• cocaine
OTHER. Other causes of congenital brain defects
include:
• intrauterine infections, including cytomegalovirus,
rubella , herpes simplex, and varicella zoster
• maternal diabetes mellitus
• maternal phenylketonuria
• fetal trauma
Symptoms
Besides the features listed above, symptoms of con-
genital brain defects may include:
• Chiari II malformation: impaired swallowing and gag
reflex, loss of the breathing reflex, facial paralysis ,
uncontrolled eye movements ( nystagmus ), impaired
balance and gait.
• Dandy-Walker malformation: symptoms of hydro-
cephalus, lack of muscle tone or “floppiness,” seizures,spasticity, deafness, irritability, visual impairment ,
deterioration of consciousness, paralysis.
• Lissencephaly: lack of muscle tone, seizures, develop-

hydrocephalus may prevent more severe brain damage.
Prevention
Some cases of congenital brain defects can be pre-
vented with good maternal nutrition , including folic
acid supplements. Folic acid is a vitamin that has been
shown to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects.Pregnant women should avoid exposure to infection,especially during the first trimester. Abstention fromdrugs and alcohol during pregnancy may reduce risk.
Genetic counseling is advisable for parents who have
had one child with anencephaly, since the likelihood ofhaving another is increased.

Congenital hip dysplasia
Definition
A condition of abnormal development of the hip,
resulting in hip joint instability and potential dislocationof the thigh bone from the socket in the pelvis. This con-dition has been more recently termed developmental hipdysplasia, as it often develops over the first few weeks,months, or years of life.
Description
Congenital hip dysplasia is a disorder in children
that is either present at birth or shortly thereafter. Duringgestation, the infant’s hip should be developing with thehead of the thigh bone (femur) sitting perfectly centeredin its shallow socket (acetabulum). The acetabulumshould cover the head of the femur as if it were a ball sit-ting inside of a cup. In the event of congenital hip dyspla-sia, the development of the acetabulum in an infantallows the femoral head to ride upward out of the jointsocket, especially when weight bearing begins.
Causes and symptoms"
"Causes and symptoms
Clinical studies show a familial tendency toward hip
dysplasia, with more females affected than males. Thisdisorder is found in many cultures around the world.However, statistics show that the Native American popu-lation has a high incidence of hip dislocation. This hasbeen documented to be due to the common practice ofswaddling and using cradleboards for restraining theinfants. This places the infant’s hips into extreme adduc-tion (brought together). The incidence of congenital hipdysplasia is also higher in infants born by caesarian andbreech position births. Evidence also shows a greaterchance of this hip abnormality in the first born comparedto the second or third child. Hormonal changes within themother during pregnancy , resulting in increased ligament"
"laxity, is thought to possibly cross over to the placentaand cause the baby to have lax ligaments while still in thewomb. Other symptoms of complete dislocation include ashortening of the leg and limited ability to abduct the leg.

"vary, a thorough physical examination is necessary for
an accurate diagnosis of congenital hip dysplasia. Thehip disorder can be diagnosed by moving the hip todetermine if the head of the femur is moving in and outof the hip joint. One specific method, called the Ortolanitest, begins with each of the examiners’ hands around theinfant’s knees, with the second and third fingers pointingdown the child’s thigh. With the legs abducted (movedapart), the examiner may be able to discern a distinctclicking sound with motion. If symptoms are presentwith a noted increase in abduction, the test is consideredpositive for hip joint instability. It is important to notethis test is only valid a few weeks after birth.
The Barlow method is another test performed with the"
"The Barlow method is another test performed with the
infant’s hip brought together with knees in full bent posi-tion. The examiner’s middle finger is placed over the out-side of the hipbone while the thumb is placed on the innerside of the knee. The hip is abducted to where it can be feltif the hip is sliding out and then back in the joint. In olderbabies, if there is a lack of range of motion in one hip oreven both hips, it is possible that the movement is blockedbecause the hip has dislocated and the muscles have con-tracted in that position. Also in older infants, hip disloca-tion is evident if one leg looks shorter than the other.
X-ray films can be helpful in detecting abnormal find-
ings of the hip joint. X rays may also be helpful in findingthe proper positioning of the hip joint for treatments of

"casting. Ultrasound has been noted as a safe and effective
tool for the diagnosis of congenital hip dysplasia. Ultra-sound has advantages over x rays, as several positions arenoted during the ultrasound procedure. This is in contrastto only one position observed during the x ray.
Treatment
The objective of treatment is to replace the head of the"
"femur into the acetabulum and, by applying constant pres-sure, to enlarge and deepen the socket. In the past, stabi-lization was achieved by placing rolled cotton diapers or apillow between the thighs, thereby keeping the knees in afrog like position. More recently, the Pavlik harness andvon Rosen splint are commonly used in infants up to theage of six months. A stiff shell cast may be used, whichachieves the same purpose, spreading the legs apart andforcing the head of the femur into the acetabulum. In somecases, in older children between six to 18 months, surgerymay be necessary to reposition the joint. Also at this age,the use of closed manipulation may be applied successful-ly, by moving the leg around manually to replace joint.Operations are not only performed to reduce the disloca-tion of the hip, but also to repair a defect in the acetabu-lum. A cast is applied after the operation to hold the headof the femur in the correct position. The use of a hometraction program is now"
"to hold the headof the femur in the correct position. The use of a hometraction program is now more common. However, after"
"the age of eight years, surgical procedures are primarilydone for pain reduction measures only. Total hip surgeries
may be inevitable later in adulthood.
Alternative treatment
Nonsurgical treatments include exercise programs,
orthosis (a force system, often involving braces), andmedications. A physical therapist may develop a programthat includes strengthening, range-of-motion exercises,pain control, and functional activities. Chiropractic
medicine may be helpful, especially the procedures ofclosed manipulations, to reduce the dislocated hip joint.

"Prognosis
Unless corrected soon after birth, abnormal stresses
cause malformation of the developing femur, with a char-acteristic limp or waddling gait. If cases of congenitalhip dysplasia go untreated, the child will have difficultywalking, which could result in life-long pain. In addition,if this condition goes untreated, the abnormal hip posi-tioning will force the acetabulum to locate to anotherposition to accommodate the displaced femur.

Description
Congenital lobar emphysema, also called infantile
lobar emphysema, is a respiratory disease that occurs ininfants when air enters the lungs but cannot leave easily.The lungs become over-inflated, causing respiratoryfunction to decrease and air to leak out into the spacearound the lungs.

"Half of the cases of congenital lobar emphysema
occur in the first four weeks of life, and three-quartersoccur in infants less than six months old. Congenitallobar emphysema is more common in boys than in girls.
Each person has two lungs, right and left. The right
lung is divided into three sections, called lobes, and theleft lung into two lobes. Congenital lobar emphysemausually affects only one lobe, and this is usually an upperlobe. It occurs most frequently in the left upper lobe, fol-lowed by the right middle lobe.
Causes and symptoms
The cause of congenital lobar emphysema often can-
not be identified. The airway may be obstructed or theinfant’s lungs may not have developed properly. Congen-ital lobar emphysema is almost never of genetic origin.

Congenital ureter anomalies
Definition
The ureter drains urine from the kidney into the
bladder. It is not simply a tube but an active organ thatpropels urine forward by muscular action. It has a valveat its bottom end that prevents urine from flowing back-ward into the kidney. Normally, there is one ureter oneach side of the body for each kidney. However, amongthe many abnormalities of ureteral development, duplica-tion is quite common. Ureters may also be malformed ina variety of ways—some harmful, others not.

"Description
The urogenital system, for some reason, is more
likely than any other to have birth defects , and they can
occur in endless variety. Ureters can be duplicated com-pletely or partially, they can be in the wrong place, theycan be deformed, and they can end in the wrong place.The trouble these abnormalities bring is directly relatedto their effect on the flow of urine. As long as urine flowsnormally through them, and only in one direction, noharm is done.

"• Duplication of ureters is quite common, either in part or
completely. Kidneys are sometimes duplicated as well.Someone may have four kidneys and four ureters or twokidneys, half of each drained by a separate ureter, or a sin-gle kidney with two, three, or four ureters attached. Aslong as urine can flow easily in the correct direction, suchmalformations may never be detected. If, however, one ofthe ureters has a dead end, a stricture or stenosis (narrow-ing), or a leaky ureterovesical valve (valve between theureter and bladder), infection is the likely result.
• Stricture or stenosis of a ureter prevents urine from
flowing freely. Whenever flow is obstructed in thebody—urine, bile, mucus, or any other liquid—infec-tion follows. Ureters can be obstructed anywhere alongtheir course, though the ureterovesical valve is the mostcommon place.

"• A ureter may have an ectopic (out of place) orifice
(opening)—it may enter the bladder, or even anotherstructure, where it does not belong and therefore with-out an adequate valve to control reflux.
• The primary ureter, or a duplicate, may not even reach
the bladder, but rather terminate in a dead end. Urinewill stagnate there and eventually cause infection.
• A ureter can be perfectly normal but in the wrong place,
such as behind the vena cava (the large vein in the mid-dle of the abdomen). A so-called retrocaval ureter maybe pinched by the vena cava so that flow is hindered.Other aberrant locations may also lead to compressionand impaired flow.
Besides infection, urine that backs up will cause the
ureter and the kidney to dilate. Eventually, the kidneywill stop functioning because of the back pressure. Thiscondition is called hydronephrosis—a kidney swollenwith urine.

severe generalized discomfort, and even leading to kid-ney failure or septicemia (infection spreading throughoutthe body by way of the blood stream).
In rare cases, urine from an ectopic ureter will bypass
the bladder and dribble out of the bottom somewhere,through a natural orifice like the vagina or a completelyseparate unnatural opening.

develop resistance to most treatments, especially thesafer ones. If it can be done with acceptable risk, it is bet-ter to repair the defect surgically.

Congestive cardiomyopathy
Definition
Cardiomyopathy is an ongoing disease process that
damages the muscle wall of the lower chambers of theheart. Congestive cardiomyopathy is the most commonform of cardiomyopathy. In congestive cardiomyopathy,also called dilated cardiomyopathy, the walls of the heartchambers stretch (dilate) to hold a greater volume ofblood than normal. Congestive cardiomyopathy is thefinal stage of many heart diseases and the most commoncondition resulting in congestive heart failure .
Description
About 50,000 Americans develop cardiomyopathy
each year. Of those, 87% have congestive cardiomyopa-thy. Primary cardiomyopathy accounts for only 1% of alldeaths from heart disease.
When the heart muscle is damaged by a disease"
"When the heart muscle is damaged by a disease
process, it cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’sneeds. Uninjured areas of the walls of the two lower heartchambers (called ventricles) stretch to make up for thelost pumping action. At first, the enlarged chambers allowmore blood to be pumped with less force. The stretchedmuscle can also contract more forcefully. Over time, theheart muscle continues to stretch, ultimately becomingweaker. The heart is forced to work harder to pump bloodby beating faster. Eventually it cannot keep up, and bloodbacks up into the veins, legs, and lungs. When this hap-pens, the condition is called congestive heart failure.
Congestive cardiomyopathy usually affects both
ventricles. Blood backed up into the lungs from the leftventricle causes fluid to congest the lung tissue. This iscalled pulmonary edema . When the right ventricle fails
to pump enough blood, blood backs up into the veinscausing edema in the legs, feet, ankles, and abdomen."
"Causes and symptoms
Congestive cardiomyopathy may be caused by a
number of conditions. Cardiomyopathy with a knowncause is called secondary cardiomyopathy. When nocause can be identified, it is called primary cardiomyopa-thy or idiopathic cardiomyopathy. About 80% of all casesof cardiomyopathy do not have a known cause. Manyheart specialists think that many cases of idiopathic con-gestive cardiomyopathy may be caused by a viral infec-tion. Because cardiomyopathy may occur many yearsafter a viral infection and viruses sometimes go undetect-ed in laboratory tests, it is difficult to know if a virus is thecause. Some people have a weak heart from advancedcoronary artery disease that causes heart muscle dam-
age. This is sometimes called ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Conditions that can cause congestive cardiomyopa-
thy are:
• Coronary artery disease
• Infections

"• noninfectious inflammatory conditions
• alcohol and other drugs or toxins•hypertension
• nutritional and metabolic disorders
•pregnancy .
Coronary artery disease is one of the most common
causes of congestive cardiomyopathy. In coronary arterydisease, the arteries supplying blood to the heart becomenarrowed or blocked. When blood flow to an area of theheart is completely blocked, the person has a heart
attack . The heart muscle suffers damage when its blood
supply is reduced or blocked. Significant recurrent mus-cle damage can occur silently. This damage can lead tocongestive cardiomyopathy.
Infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and other
microorganisms can involve the heart, causing inflamma-tion of the heart muscle ( myocarditis ). The inflamma-
tion may damage the heart muscle and cause congestivecardiomyopathy. In the United States, the coxsackievirusKEY TERMS

Cardiac catheterization usually is only used if a
diagnosis cannot be made with other methods. In cardiaccatheterization, a small tube (called a catheter) is insertedinto an artery and passed into the heart. It is used to mea-
sure pressure in the heart and the amount of bloodpumped by the heart. A small tissue sample of the heartmuscle can be removed through the catheter for examina-tion under a microscope (biopsy). This biopsy can showthe type and amount of damage to the heart muscle.

"Treatment
When a patient is diagnosed with congestive car-
diomyopathy, physicians try to find out the cause. Ifcoronary artery disease is not the culprit, in most othercases a cause is not identified. When a condition respon-sible for the congestive cardiomyopathy is diagnosed,treatment is aimed at correcting the underlying condi-tion. Congestive cardiomyopathy caused by drinkingexcess alcohol or by drugs or toxins can be treated byeliminating the alcohol or toxin completely. In somecases, the heart may recover after the toxic substance isremoved from the body. Bacterial myocarditis is treatedwith an antibiotic to eliminate the bacteria.
There is no cure for idiopathic congestive cardiomy-
opathy. Medicines are given to reduce the workload ofthe heart and to relieve the symptoms.
One or more of the following types of medicines
may be prescribed for congestive cardiomyopathy:
• digitalis
•diuretics

"•diuretics
•vasodilators
•beta blockers
• angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhib-
itors)
• angiotensin receptor blockers
Digitalis helps the heart muscle to have stronger
pumping action. Diuretics help eliminate excess salt andwater from the kidneys by making patients urinate moreoften. This helps reduce the swelling caused by fluidbuildup in the tissues. Vasodilators, beta blockers, andACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and expand theblood vessels so blood can move more easily throughthem. This action makes it easier for the heart to pumpblood through the vessels.
Patients may also be given anticoagulant medica-"
"Patients may also be given anticoagulant medica-
tions to prevent clots from forming due to pooling ofblood in the heart chambers. Medicines to prevent abnor-mal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) may be given, but someof these drugs can also reduce the force of heart contrac-tions. Automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators(AICDs) can treat life-threatening arrhythmias, whichare relatively common in severe cardiomyopathy.

"Certain lifestyle changes may help reduce the work-
load on the heart and relieve symptoms. Some patientsmay need to change their diet, stop drinking alcohol,begin a physician-supervised exercise program, and/or
stop smoking .
Severe congestive cardiomyopathy usually causes
heart failure. When the heart muscle is damaged soseverely that medicines cannot help, a heart transplantmay be the only remaining treatment to be considered.
Prognosis
The outlook for a patient with congestive cardiomy-
opathy depends on the severity of the disease and theperson’s health. Generally, congestive cardiomyopathyworsens over time and the prognosis is not good. About50% of patients with congestive cardiomyopathy live forfive years after the diagnosis. Twenty five percent ofpatients are alive 10 years after diagnosis. Women withcongestive cardiomyopathy live twice as long as menwith the disease. Many of the deaths are caused by sud-den abnormal heart rhythms.
Prevention"
"Prevention
Because idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy does
not have a known cause, there is no sure way to preventit. The best way to prevent congestive cardiomyopathy isto avoid known causes such as drinking excess alcohol ortaking toxic drugs. Eating a nutritious diet and gettingregular exercise to improve overall fitness also can helpthe heart to stay healthy.
Congestive cardiomyopathy may also be prevented by
identifying and treating any conditions that might damagethe heart muscle. These include high blood pressure andcoronary artery disease. Regular blood pressure checksand obtaining immediate medical care for hypertensionand symptoms of coronary artery disease, such as chestpain, are important to keep the heart functioning properly.
Finally, diagnosing and treating congestive car-
diomyopathy before the heart becomes severely damagedmay improve the outlook.

Congenital heart disease
Definition
Congenital heart disease, also called congenital
heart defect, includes a variety of malformations of theheart or its major blood vessels that are present at birth.
Description

"Description
Congenital heart disease occurs when the heart or
blood vessels near the heart do not develop properlybefore birth. Some infants are born with mild types ofcongenital heart disease, but most need surgery in orderto survive. Patients who have had surgery are likely toexperience other cardiac problems later in life.
Most types of congenital heart disease obstruct the
flow of blood in the heart or the nearby vessels, or causean abnormal flow of blood through the heart. Rarer typesof congenital heart disease occur when the newborn hasonly one ventricle, or when the pulmonary artery and theaorta come out of the same ventricle, or when one side ofthe heart is not completely formed.
Patent ductus arteriosus
Patent ductus arteriosus refers to the opening of a"
"Patent ductus arteriosus
Patent ductus arteriosus refers to the opening of a
passageway—or temporary blood vessel (ductus)—tocarry the blood from the heart to the aorta before birth,allowing blood to bypass the lungs, which are not yetfunctional. The ductus should close spontaneously in thefirst few hours or days after birth. When it does not closein the newborn, some of the blood that should flowthrough the aorta then returns to the lungs. Patent ductusarteriosus is common in premature babies, but rare infull-term babies. It has also been associated with motherswho had German measles (rubella ) while pregnant.
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a condition in
which the left side of the heart is underdeveloped, is rare,but it is the most serious type of congenital heart disease.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 899Congenital heart diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 899"
"With this syndrome, blood reaches the aorta, which
pumps blood to the entire body, only from the ductus,which then normally closes within a few days of birth. Inhypoplastic left heart syndrome, the baby seems normalat birth, but as the ductus closes, blood cannot reach theaorta and circulation fails.
Obstruction defects
When heart valves, arteries, or veins are narrowed,
they partly or completely block the flow of blood. Themost common obstruction defects are pulmonary valve
stenosis ,aortic valve stenosis , and coarctation of the
aorta . Bicuspid aortic valve and subaortic stenosis are
less common.
Stenosis is a narrowing of the valves or arteries. In"
"less common.
Stenosis is a narrowing of the valves or arteries. In
pulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary valve does not openproperly, forcing the right ventricle to work harder. Inaortic stenosis, the improperly formed aortic valve is nar-rowed. As the left ventricle works harder to pump bloodthrough the body, it becomes enlarged. In coarctation ofthe aorta, the aorta is constricted, reducing the flow ofblood to the lower part of the body and increasing bloodpressure in the upper body.
A bicuspid aortic valve has only two flaps instead
of three, which can lead to stenosis in adulthood.Subaortic stenosis is a narrowing of the left ventriclebelow the aortic valve, that limits the flow of blood fromthe left ventricle.
Septal defects

"Septal defects
When a baby is born with a hole in the septum (the
wall separating the right and left sides of the heart),blood leaks from the left side of the heart to the right,or from a higher pressure zone to a lower pressurezone. A major leakage can lead to enlargement of theheart and failing circulation. The most common typesof septal defects are atrial septal defect , an opening
between the two upper heart chambers, and ventricu-
lar septal defect , an opening between the two lower
heart chambers. Ventricular septal defect accounts forabout 15% of all cases of congenital heart disease inthe United States.
Cyanotic defects
Heart disorders that cause a decreased, inadequate
amount of oxygen in blood pumped to the body arecalled cyanotic defects. Cyanotic defects, including trun-cus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return,tetralogy of Fallot ,transposition of the great arteries ,"
"and tricuspid atresia, result in a blue discoloration of theskin due to low oxygen levels. About 10% of cases ofcongenital heart disease in the United States are tetralogy
of Fallot, which includes four defects. The major defectsare a large hole between the ventricles, which allowsoxygen-poor blood to mix with oxygen-rich blood, andnarrowing at or beneath the pulmonary valve. The otherdefects are an overly muscular right ventricle and anaorta that lies over the ventricular hole.
In transposition (reversal of position) of the great
arteries, the pulmonary artery and the aorta are reversed,causing oxygen-rich blood to re-circulate to the lungswhile oxygen-poor blood goes to the rest of the body. Intricuspid atresia, the baby lacks a triscupid valve andblood cannot flow properly from the right atrium to theright ventricle.

"Other defects
Ebstein’s anomaly is a rare congenital syndrome that
causes malformed tricuspid valve leaflets, which allowblood to leak between the right ventricle and the rightatrium. It also may cause a hole in the wall between theleft and right atrium. Treatment often involves repairingthe tricuspid valve. Ebstein’s anomaly may be associatedwith maternal use of the psychiatric drug lithium duringpregnancy .
Brugada syndrome is another rare congenital heart
defect that appears in adulthood and may cause suddendeath if untreated. Symptoms, which include rapid,
uneven heart beat, often appear at night. Scientists believethat Brugada syndrome is caused by mutations in the geneSCN5A, which involves cardiac sodium channels.
Infants born with DiGeorge sequence can have heart
defects such as a malformed aortic arch and tetralogy ofFallot. Researchers believe DiGeorge sequence is mostoften caused by mutations in genes in the region 22q11.
Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder"
"Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder
that causes tears in the aorta. Since the disease also causesexcessive bone growth, most Marfan syndrome patientsare over six feet tall. In athletes, and others, it can lead tosudden death. Researchers believe the defect responsiblefor Marfan’s syndrome is found in gene FBN1, on chro-mosome 15.
About 32,000 infants are born every year with con-
genital heart disease, which is the most common birthdefect. About half of these cases require medical treat-ment. More than one million people with heart defectsare currently living in the United States.
Causes and symptoms
In most cases, the causes of congenital heart disease
are unknown. Genetic and environmental factors andlifestyle habits can all be involved. The likelihood of hav-

"ing a child with a congenital heart disease increases if the
mother or father, another child, or another relative hadcongenital heart disease or a family history of suddendeath. Viral infections, such as German measles, can pro-duce congenital heart disease. Women with diabetes andphenylketonuria also are at higher risk of having chil-
dren with congenital heart defects. Many cases of congen-ital heart disease result from the mother’s excessive use ofalcohol or taking illegal drugs, such as cocaine , while
pregnant. The mother’s exposure to certain anticonvulsantand dermatologic drugs during pregnancy can also causecongenital heart disease. There are many genetic condi-tions, such as Down syndrome , which affect multiple
organs and can cause congenital heart disease.

cy, sweating, cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin),"
"cy, sweating, cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin),
heart murmur, respiratory infections that recur excessive-ly, stunted growth, and limbs and muscles that are under-developed.
Symptoms of specific types of congenital heart dis-
ease are as follows:

ceptibility to pneumonia , rapid breathing. If the ductus
is small, there are no symptoms.
• Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: ashen color, rapid and
difficult breathing, inability to eat.
• Obstruction defects: cyanosis (skin that is discolored

"Arterial switch, to correct transposition of the great

Balloon valvuloplasty uses aballoon-tipped catheter to open a narrowed heart valve,improving the flow of blood in pulmonary stenosis. It issometimes used in aortic stenosis.

"For tricuspid atresia and pulmonary atresia, the
Fontan procedure connects the right atrium to the pul-monary artery directly or with a conduit, and the atrialdefect is closed. Pulmonary artery banding, narrowingthe pulmonary artery with a band to reduce blood flowand pressure in the lungs, is used for ventricular septaldefect, atrioventricular canal defect, and tricuspid atresia.Later, the band can be removed and the defect correctedwith open-heart surgery.
To correct aortic stenosis, the Ross procedure grafts
the pulmonary artery to the aorta. For tetralogy of Fallot,tricuspid atresia, or pulmonary atresia, the shunt proce-dure creates a passage between blood vessels, sendingblood into parts of the body that need it. For transposi-tion of the great arteries, venous switch creates a tunnelinside the atria to re-direct oxygen-rich blood to the rightventricle and aorta and venous blood to the left ventricleand pulmonary artery.

"When all other options fail, some patients may need
a heart transplant. Children with congenital heart diseaserequire lifelong monitoring, even after successfulsurgery. The American Heart Association recommendsregular dental check-ups and the preventive use ofantibiotics to protect patients from heart infections, or
endocarditis . Since children with congenital heart dis-
ease have slower growth, nutrition is important. Physi-
cians may also limit their athletic activity.
Prognosis
The outlook for children with congenital heart dis-
ease has improved markedly in the past two decades.Many types of congenital heart disease that would havebeen fatal can now be treated successfully. Research on
diagnosing heart defects when the fetus is in the wombmay lead to future treatment to correct defects beforebirth. Promising new prevention methods and treatmentsinclude genetic screening and the cultivation of cardiactissue in the laboratory that could be used to repair con-genital heart defects."

Conjunctivitis
Definition
Conjuctivitis is an inflammation or redness of the
lining of the white part of the eye and the underside ofthe eyelid (conjunctiva) that can be caused by infection,allergic reaction, or physical agents like infrared or ultra-violet light.
Description
Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjuncti-
va, a thin, delicate membrane that covers the eyeball andlines the eyelid. Conjunctivitis is an extremely commoneye problem because the conjunctiva is continually
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 902ConjunctivitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 902"
"exposed to microorganisms and environmental agents
that can cause infections or allergic reactions. Conjunc-tivitis can be acute or chronic depending upon how longthe condition lasts, the severity of symptoms, and thetype of organism or agent involved. It can also affect oneor both eyes and, if caused by infection, can be very easi-ly transmitted to others during close physical contact,particularly among children in a daycare center. Othernames for conjunctivitis include pink eye and red eye.
Causes and symptoms
Conjunctivitis may be caused by a viral infection,
such as a cold, acute respiratory infection, or diseasesuch as measles , herpes simplex, or herpes zoster. Symp-"
"toms include mild to severe discomfort in one or botheyes, redness, swelling of the eyelids, and watery, yellow,or green discharge. Symptoms may last anywhere fromseveral days to two weeks. Infection with an adenovirus,however, may also cause a significant amount of pus-likedischarge and a scratchy, foreign body-type of sensationin the eye. This may also be accompanied by swellingand tenderness of the lymph nodes near the ear.
Bacterial conjunctivitis can occur in adults and chil-
dren and is caused by organisms such as Staphylococcus ,
Streptococcus , and Hemophilus . Symptoms of bacterial
conjunctivitis include a pus-like discharge and crustyeyelids after awakening. Redness of the conjunctiva canbe mild to severe and may be accompanied by swelling.Persons with symptoms of conjunctivitis who are sexual-ly active may possibly be infected with the bacteria thatcause either gonorrhea or chlamydia. There may be"
"large amounts of pus-like discharge, and symptoms mayinclude intolerance to light (photophobia), waterymucous discharge, and tenderness in the lymph nodesnear the ear that may persist for up to three months.
Conjunctivitis may also be caused by environmental
hazards, such as wind, smoke, dust, and allergic reac-tions caused by pollen, dust, or grass. Symptoms rangefrom itching and redness to a mucous discharge. Persons
who wear contact lenses may develop allergic conjunc-tivitis caused by the various eye solutions and foreignproteins contained in them.
Other less common causes of conjunctivitis include
exposure to sun lamps or the electrical arcs used duringwelding, and problems with inadequate drainage of thetear ducts.
Diagnosis
An accurate diagnosis of conjunctivitis centers on
taking a patient history to learn when symptoms began,how long the condition has been going on, the symptomsexperienced, and other predisposing factors, such as"
"upper respiratory complaints, allergies ,sexually trans-
mitted diseases , herpes simplex infections, and exposure
to persons with pink eye. It may be helpful to learnwhether an aspect of an individual’s occupation may bethe cause, for example, welding. Diagnostic tests are usu-ally not indicated unless initial treatment fails or an infec-tion with gonorrhea or chlamydia is suspected. In suchcases, the discharge may be cultured and Gram stained todetermine the organism responsible for causing the condi-tion. Cultures and smears are relatively painless.
Treatment
The treatment of conjunctivitis depends on what
caused the condition. In all cases, warm compressesapplied to the affected eye several times a day may helpto reduce discomfort.
Conjunctivitis due to a viral infection, particularly
those due to adenoviruses, are usually treated by applyingwarm compresses to the eye(s) and applying topical antibi-otic ointments to prevent secondary bacterial infections."
"Viral conjunctivitis caused by herpes simplex should
be referred to an ophthalmologist. Topical steroids are com-monly prescribed in combination with antiviral therapy.
In cases of bacterial conjunctivitis, a physician may
prescribe an antibiotic eye ointment or eye drops contain-ing sodium sulfacetamide (Sulamyd) to be applied dailyfor seven to 14 days. If, after 72 hours, the condition doesnot improve, a physician or primary care provider shouldbe notified because the bacteria involved may be resistantto the antibiotic used or the cause may not be bacterial.
For cases of conjunctivitis caused by a gonococcal
organism, a physician may prescribe an intramuscularinjection of ceftriaxone (Rocephin) and a topical antibi-

"otic ointment containing erythromycin or bactracin to be
applied four times daily for two to three weeks. Sexualpartners should also be treated.
With accompanying chlamydia infection, a topical
antibiotic ointment containing erythromycin (Ilotycin)may be prescribed to be applied 1-2 times daily. In addi-tion, oral erythromycin or tetracycline therapy may beindicated for three to four weeks. Here again, sexualpartners should also be treated.
Allergic conjunctivitis can be treated by removing
the allergic substance from a person’s environment, ifpossible; by applying cool compresses to the eye; and byadministering eye drops four to six times daily for fourdays. Also, the antihistamine diphenhydraminehydrochloride (Benadryl) may help to relieve itchy eyes.
Alternative treatment
Conjunctivitis caused by gonococcal and chlamydial"
"Alternative treatment
Conjunctivitis caused by gonococcal and chlamydial
infection usually requires conventional medical treat-ment. With bacterial, viral, and allergic conjunctivitis,however, alternative options can be helpful. Internalimmune enhancement with supplementation can aid inthe resolution of bacterial and viral conjunctivitis.Removal of the allergic agent is an essential step in treat-ing allergic conjunctivitis. As with any of the recom-mended treatments, however, if no improvement is seenwithin 48–72 hours, a physician should be consulted.Homeopathically, there are a number of acute reme-
dies designed to treat conjunctivitis. These include Pul-
satilla (windflower, Pulsatilla nigricans ),Belladonna ,
and eyebright ( Euphrasia officinalis ). Eye drops, pre-"
"and eyebright ( Euphrasia officinalis ). Eye drops, pre-
pared with homeopathic remedies and/or herbs, can be agood substitute for pharmaceutical eye drops. Eye washescan also be made. Herbal eyewashes made with eyebright(1 tsp. dried herb steeped in 1 pint of boiling water) orchamomile ( Matricaria recutita ; 2–3 tsp in 1 pt of boiling
water) may be helpful. Eyewashes should be strained andcooled before use, and close attention should be paid tomake sure that any solution put into the eye is sterile.
Other simple home remedies may help relieve the
discomfort associated with conjunctivitis. A boric acideyewash can be used to clean and soothe the eyes. Awarm compress applied to the eyes for five to 10 minutesthree times a day can help relieve the discomfort of bac-terial and viral conjunctivitis. A cool compress or cool,damp tea bags placed on the eyes can ease the discomfortof allergic conjunctivitis.

"Prognosis
If treated properly, the prognosis for conjunctivitis is

However,allergic conjunctivitis will likely recur if the individualagain comes into contact with the particular allergen.Conjunctivitis caused by bacteria or a virus, if treatedproperly, is usually resolved in 10–14 days. If there is norelief of symptoms in 48–72 hours, or there is moderateto severe eye pain , changes in vision, or the conjunctivi-
tis is suspected to be caused by herpes simplex, a physi-cian should be notified immediately. If untreated or iftreatment fails and is not corrected, conjunctivitis maycause visual impairment by spreading to other parts of
the eye, such as the cornea.

Constipation
Definition
Constipation is an acute or chronic condition in
which bowel movements occur less often than usual orconsist of hard, dry stools that are painful or difficult topass. Bowel habits vary, but an adult who has not had abowel movement in three days or a child who has not hada bowel movement in four days is considered constipated.
Description
Constipation is one of the most common medical
complaints in the United States. Constipation can occurat any age, and is more common among individuals whoresist the urge to move their bowels at their body’s sig-nal. This often happens when children start school orenter daycare and feel shy about asking permission to usethe bathroom."
"Constipation is more common in women than in
men and is especially apt to occur during pregnancy .
Age alone does not increase the frequency of constipa-tion, but elderly people (especially women) are morelikely to suffer from constipation.
Although this condition is rarely serious, it can lead to:
• bowel obstruction
• chronic constipation• hemorrhoids (a mass of dilated veins in swollen tissue
around the anus)
• hernia (a protrusion of an organ through a tear in the
muscle wall)
• spastic colitis ( irritable bowel syndrome , a condition
characterized by alternating periods of diarrhea and
constipation)
• laxative dependency
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 905ConstipationGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 905"
"Chronic constipation may be a symptom of colorec-
tal cancer , depression, diabetes, diverticulosis (small
pouches in the muscles of the large intestine), lead poi-
soning , or Parkinson’s disease .
In someone who is elderly or disabled, constipation
may be a symptom of bowel impaction, a more seriouscondition in which feces are trapped in the lower part ofthe large intestine. A doctor should be called if an elderlyor disabled person is constipated for a week or more or ifa child seems to be constipated.
A doctor should be notified whenever constipation
occurs after starting a new prescription, vitamin, or min-eral supplement or is accompanied by blood in the stools,changes in bowel patterns, or fever and abdominal pain .
Causes and symptoms
Constipation usually results from not getting enough
exercise , not drinking enough water, or from a diet that
does not include an adequate amount of fiber-rich foodslike beans, bran cereals, fruits, raw vegetables, rice, andwhole-grain breads."
"Other causes of constipation include anal fissure (a
tear or crack in the lining of the anus); chronic kidney
failure ; colon or rectal cancer ; depression; hypercal-
cemia (abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood);
hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland); illness
requiring complete bed rest; irritable bowel syndrome;and stress .
Constipation can also be a side effect of:
• aluminum salts in antacids
• antihistamines
• antipsychotic drugs
• aspirin• belladonna ( Atopa belladonna, source of atropine, a
medication used to relieve spasms and dilate the pupilsof the eye)
• beta blockers (medications used to stabilize irregular
heartbeat, lower high blood pressure, reduce chest pain)
• blood pressure medications
• calcium channel blockers (medication prescribed to
treat high blood pressure, chest pain, some types ofirregular heartbeat and stroke , and some non-cardiac
diseases)
• diuretics (drugs that promote the formation and secre-
tion of urine)"
"diseases)
• diuretics (drugs that promote the formation and secre-
tion of urine)
• iron or calcium supplements• narcotics (potentially addictive drugs that relieve pain
and cause mood changes)• tricyclic antidepressants (medications prescribed to
treat chronic pain, depression, headaches, and other ill-nesses)
An adult who is constipated may feel bloated, have a
headache , swollen abdomen, or pass rock-like feces; or
strain, bleed, or feel pain during bowel movements. Aconstipated baby may strain, cry, draw the legs towardthe abdomen, or arch the back when having a bowelmovement.
Diagnosis
Everyone becomes constipated once in a while, but a
doctor should be notified if significant changes in bowelpatterns last for more than a week or if symptoms contin-ue more than three weeks after increasing activity andfiber and fluid intake.
The patient’s observations and medical history help"
"The patient’s observations and medical history help
a primary care physician diagnose constipation. The doc-tor uses his fingers to see if there is a hardened mass inthe abdomen, and may perform a rectal examination .
Other diagnostic procedures include a barium enema ,
which reveals blockage inside the intestine; laboratoryanalysis of blood and stool samples for internal bleedingor other symptoms of systemic disease; and a sigmoi-
doscopy (examination of the sigmoid area of the colon
with a flexible tube equipped with a magnifying lens).
Physical and psychological assessments and a
detailed history of bowel habits are especially importantwhen an elderly person complains of constipation.
Treatment
If changes in diet and activity fail to relieve occa-
sional constipation, an over-the-counter laxative may beused for a few days. Preparations that soften stools or addbulk (bran, psyllium) work more slowly but are saferthan Epsom salts and other harsh laxatives or herbal lax-"
"atives containing senna ( Cassia senna ) or buckthorn
(Rhamnus purshianna ), which can harm the nerves and
lining of the colon.
A woman who is pregnant should never use a laxa-
tive. Neither should anyone who is experiencing abdomi-nal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
A warm-water or mineral oil enema can relieve con-
stipation, and a non-digestible sugar (lactulose) or spe-cial electrolyte solution is recommended for adults andolder children with stubborn symptoms.
If a patient has an impacted bowel, the doctor inserts
a gloved finger into the rectum and gently dislodges thehardened feces.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 906ConstipationGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 906"
"Alternative treatment
Initially, alternative practitioners will suggest that
the patient drink an adequate amount of water each day(six to eight glasses), exercise on a regular basis, and eata diet high in soluble and insoluble fibers. Soluble fibersinclude pectin, flax, and gums; insoluble fibers includepsyllium and brans from grains like wheat and oats.Fresh fruits and vegetables contain both soluble andinsoluble fibers. Castor oil, applied topically to theabdomen and covered by a heat source (a heating pad orhot water bottle), can help relieve constipation whenused nightly for 20–30 minutes.
Acupressure
This needleless form of acupuncture is said to relax
the abdomen, ease discomfort, and stimulate regular bowelmovements when diet and exercise fail to do so. After lyingdown, the patient closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.For two minutes, he applies gentle fingertip pressure to apoint about two and one-half inches below the navel."
"Accupressure can also be applied to the outer edges
of one elbow crease and maintained for 30 secondsbefore pressing the crease of the other elbow. This shouldbe done three times a day to relieve constipation.
Aromatherapy
Six drops of rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ) and
six drops of thyme ( Thymus spp.) diluted by 1 oz of
almond oil, olive oil, or another carrier oil can relieveconstipation when used to massage the abdomen.
Herbal therapy
A variety of herbal therapies can be useful in the
treatment of constipation. Several herbs, includingchamomile ( Matricaria recutita ), dandelion ( Taraxacum
mongolicum ), and burdock ( Arctium lappa ), act as bit-
ters, stimulating the movement of the digestive andexcretory systems. There are also “laxative” herbs thatassist with bowel movement. Two of these are senna(Cassia senna ) and buckthorn ( Rhamnus purshiana )."
"These “laxative” herbs are stronger acting on eliminationthan bitters and can sometimes cause cramping (mixingthem with a calming herb like fennel or caraway can helpreduce cramping). Both senna and buckthorn are power-ful herbs that are best used with direction from an experi-enced practitioner, since they can have adverse sideeffects and the patient may become dependent on them.
Homeopathy
Homeopathy also can offer assistance with consti-
pation. There are acute remedies for constipation that canbe found in one of the many home remedy books on
homeopathic medicine. A constitutional prescription alsocan help rebalance someone who is struggling with con-stipation.
Massage
Massaging the leg from knee to hip in the morning,
at night, and before trying to move the bowels is said torelieve constipation. There is also a specific Swedishmassage technique that can help relieve constipation.
Yoga

"Yoga
The knee-chest position, said to relieve gas and stim-
ulate abdominal organs, involves:
• standing straight with arms at the sides• lifting the right knee toward the chest• grasping the right ankle with the left hand• pulling the leg as close to the chest as possible• holding the position for about eight seconds• repeating these steps with the left leg
The cobra position, which can be repeated as many
as four time a day, involves:
• lying on the stomach with legs together
• placing the palms just below the shoulders, holding
elbows close to the body
• inhaling, then lifting the head (face forward) and chest

Prognosis
Changes in diet and exercise usually eliminate the
problem.
Prevention
Most Americans consume between 11–18 g of fiber
a day. Consumption of 30 grams of fiber and between sixand eight glasses of water each day can generally preventconstipation.
Thirty-five grams of fiber a day (an amount equal to
five servings of fruits and vegetables, and a large bowl ofhigh-fiber cereal) can relieve constipation.
Daily use of 500 mg vitamin C and 400 mg magne-
sium can prevent constipation. If symptoms do occur,each dosage can be increased by 100 mg a day, up to amaximum of 5,000 mg vitamin C and 1,000 mg magne-sium. Use of preventive doses should be resumed afterrelief occurs, and vitamin C should be decreased to thepre-diarrhea dosage if the patient develops diarrhea.
Sitting on the toilet for 10 minutes at the same time"
"Sitting on the toilet for 10 minutes at the same time
every day, preferably after a meal, can induce regularbowel movements. This may not become effective for afew months, and it is important to defecate whenevernecessary.
Fiber supplements containing psyllium ( Plantago
psyllium ) usually become effective within about 48 hours
and can be used every day without causing dependency.Powdered flaxseed ( Linium usitatissimum ) works the
same way. Insoluble fiber, like wheat or oat bran, is aseffective as psyllium but may give the patient gas at first.

Thousands of natural and man-made substances can
cause contact dermatitis, which is the most common skincondition requiring medical attention and the foremostsource of work-related disease. Florists, domestic work-ers, hairdressers, food preparers, and employees inindustry, construction, and health care are the peoplemost at risk of contracting work-related contact dermati-tis. Americans spend roughly $300 million a year in theirquest for relief from contact dermatitis, not counting theconsiderable sums devoted by governments and business-es to regulating and policing the use of skin-threateningchemicals in the workplace. But exactly how many peo-ple suffer from contact dermatitis remains unclear; a 1997article in the Journal of the American Medical Associa-

Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is the more com-
monly reported of the two kinds of contact dermatitis,and is seen in about 80% of cases. It can be caused bysoaps, detergents, solvents, adhesives, fiberglass, andother substances that are able to directly injure the skin.Most attacks are slight and confined to the hands andforearms, but can affect any part of the body that comes

can take many forms: redness, itching , crusting,
swelling, blistering, oozing, dryness, scaliness, thicken-ing of the skin, and a feeling of warmth at the site of con-tact. In extreme cases, severe blistering can occur andopen sores can form. Jobs that require frequent skinexposure to water, such as hairdressing and food prepara-tion, can make the skin more susceptible to ICD.

"Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) results when
repeated exposure to an allergen (an allergy-causing sub-stance) triggers an immune response that inflames theskin. Tens of thousands of drugs, pesticides, cosmetics,food additives, commercial chemicals, and other sub-stances have been identified as potential allergens. Fewerthan 30, however, are responsible the majority of ACDcases. Common culprits include poison ivy, poison oak,and poison sumac; fragrances and preservatives in cosmet-ics and personal care products; latex items such as glovesand condoms; and formaldehyde. Many people find thatthey are allergic to the nickel in inexpensive jewelry. ACDis usually confined to the area of skin that comes in contactwith the allergen, typically the hands or face.

Diagnosis begins with a physical examination and
asking the patient questions about his or her health anddaily activities. When contact dermatitis is suspected, thedoctor attempts to learn as much as possible about thepatient’s hobbies, workplace duties, use of medicationsand cosmetics, etc.—anything that might shed light onthe source of the disease. In some cases, an examinationof the home or workplace is undertaken. If the dermatitisis mild, responds well to treatment, and does not recur,ordinarily the investigation is at an end. More difficultcases require patch testing to identify the allergen.

"Two methods of patch testing are currently used. The
most widely used method, the Finn chamber method,employs a multiwell, aluminum patch. Each well is filledwith a small amount of the allergen being tested and thepatch is taped to normal skin on the patient’s upper back.After 48 hours, the patch is removed and an initial readingis taken. A second reading is made a few days later. Thesecond method of patch testing involves applying a smallamount of the test substance to directly to normal skinand covering it with a dressing that keeps air out andkeeps the test substance in (occlusive dressing). After 48hours, the dressing is taken off to see if a reaction hasoccurred. Identifying the allergen may require repeatedtesting, can take weeks or months, and is not always suc-cessful. Moreover, patch testing works only with ACD,
though it is considered an essential step in ruling out ICD.

"Treatment
The best treatment for contact dermatitis is to identify
the allergen or irritating substance and avoid further con-tact with it. If the culprit is, for instance, a cosmetic, avoid-ance is a simple matter, but in some situations, such as anallergy to an essential workplace chemical for which nosubstitute can be found, avoidance may be impossible orforce the sufferer to find new work or make other drasticchanges in his or her life. Barrier creams and protectiveclothing such as gloves, masks, and long-sleeved shirts areways of coping with contact dermatitis when avoidance isimpossible, though they are not always effective.
For the symptoms themselves, treatments in mild
cases include cool compresses and nonprescriptionlotions and ointments. When the symptoms are severe,corticosteroids applied to the skin or taken orally are
used. Contact dermatitis that leads to a bacterial skininfection is treated with antibiotics .

Among the herbs often recommended are:
• Burdock ( Arctium lappa ) minimizes inflammation and
boosts the immune system. It is taken internally as a teaor tincture (a concentrated herbal extract prepared withalcohol).
• Calendula ( Calendula officinalis ) is a natural antiseptic
and anti-inflammatory agent. It is applied topically in alotion, ointment, or oil to the affected area.
• Aloe ( Aloe barbadensis ) soothes skin irritations. The
gel is applied topically to the affected area.
A homeopath treating a patient with contact dermati-
tis will do a thorough investigation of the individual’s his-tory and exposures before prescribing a remedy. Onehomeopathic remedy commonly prescribed to relieve theitching associated with contact dermatitis is Rhus toxico-
dendron taken internally three to four times daily.

"Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac are common
culprits in cases of allergic contact dermatitis. Followingexposure to these plants, rash development may be prevent-ed by washing the area with soap and water within 15 min-utes of exposure. The leaves of jewelweed ( Impatiens spp.),
which often grows near poison ivy, may neutralize the poi-son-ivy allergen if rubbed on the skin right after contact.Several topical remedies may help relieve the itching asso-ciated with allergic contact dermatitis, including the juiceof plantain leaves ( Plantago major ); a paste made of equal
parts of green clay and goldenseal root ( Hydrastis
canadensis ); a paste made of salt, water, clay, and pepper-
mint ( Mentha piperita ) oil; and calamine lotion.

Contraception
Definition
Contraception (birth control) prevents pregnancy
by interfering with the normal process of ovulation, fer-

"tilization, and implantation. There are different kinds of
birth control that act at different points in the process.
Purpose
Every month, a woman’s body begins the process
that can potentially lead to pregnancy. An egg (ovum)matures, the mucus that is secreted by the cervix (a cylin-drical-shaped organ at the lower end of the uterus)changes to be more inviting to sperm, and the lining ofthe uterus grows in preparation for receiving a fertilizedegg. Any woman who wants to prevent pregnancy mustuse a reliable form of birth control.
Birth control (contraception) is designed to interfere
with the normal process and prevent the pregnancy thatcould result. There are different kinds of birth controlthat act at different points in the process, from ovulation,through fertilization, to implantation. Each method hasits own side effects and risks. Some methods are morereliable than others.
Although there are many different types of birth"
"Although there are many different types of birth
control, they can be divided into a few groups based onhow they work. These groups include:
• Hormonal methods—These use medications (hor-
mones) to prevent ovulation. Hormonal methodsinclude birth control pills ( oral contraceptives ), Depo
Provera injections and Norplant.
• Barrier methods—These methods work by preventing
the sperm from getting to and fertilizing the egg. Barri-er methods include the condom , diaphragm, and cervi-
cal cap. The condom is the only form of birth controlthat also protects against sexually transmitted dis-
eases , including HIV (the virus that causes AIDS ).
• Spermicides—These medications kill sperm on con-
tact. Most spermicides contain nonoxynyl-9. Spermi-cides come in many different forms such as jelly, foam,tablets, and even a transparent film. All are placed inthe vagina. Spermicides work best when they are usedat the same time as a barrier method.
• Intrauterine devices—Intrauterine contraceptive"
"• Intrauterine devices—Intrauterine contraceptive
devices (IUDs) are inserted into the uterus, where theystay from one to 10 years. An IUD prevents the fertil-
ized egg from implanting in the lining of the uterus, andmay have other effects as well.
• Tubal sterilization—Tubal sterilization is a permanent
form of contraception for women. Each fallopian tubeis either tied or burned closed. The sperm cannot reachthe egg, and the egg cannot travel to the uterus.
• Vasectomy—is the male form of sterilization, and
should also be considered permanent. In vasectomy ,
the vas defrens, the tiny tubes that carry the sperm intothe semen, are cut and tied off. Thus, no sperm can getinto the semen.
Unfortunately, there is no perfect form of birth con-"
"Unfortunately, there is no perfect form of birth con-
trol. Only abstinence (not having sexual intercourse) canprotect against unwanted pregnancy with 100% reliability.The failure rates, which means the rates of pregnancy, formost forms of birth control are quite low. However, someforms of birth control are more difficult or inconvenient touse than others. In actual practice, the birth control meth-ods that are more difficult or inconvenient have muchhigher failure rates because they are not used faithfully.

All the different forms of birth control have one thing
in common. They are only effective if used faithfully.Birth control pills will work only if taken every day; the

of sexual intercourse. The same is true for condoms andthe cervical cap. Some methods are automatically work-ing every day, no matter what. These methods includeDepo Provera, Norplant, the IUD, and tubal sterilization.
There are many different ways to use birth control.
They can be divided into several groups:
• By mouth (oral)—Birth control pills must be taken by
mouth every day.
• Injected—Depo Provera is a hormonal medication that
is given by injection every three months.
• Implanted—Norplant is a long-acting hormonal form
of birth control that is implanted under the skin of theupper arm.
• Vaginal—Spermicides and barrier methods work in the
vagina.
• Intra-uterine—The IUD is inserted into the uterus.
• Surgical—Tubal sterilization is a form of surgery. A
doctor must perform the procedure in a hospital or sur-gical clinic. Many women need general anesthesia.
The methods of birth control differ from each other"
"The methods of birth control differ from each other
in the timing of when they are used. Some methods ofbirth control must be used specifically at the time of sex-ual intercourse (condoms, diaphragm, cervical cap, sper-micides). All other methods of birth control must beworking all the time to provide protection (hormonalmethods, IUDs, tubal sterilization).
Precautions
There are risks associated with some forms of birth
control. Some of the risks of each method are listedbelow:
• Birth control pills—The hormone (estrogen) in birth
control pills can increase the risk of heart attack in
women over 40 who smoke.
• IUD—The IUD can increase the risk of serious pelvic
infection. The IUD can also injure the uterus by pokinginto or through the uterine wall. Surgery might be need-ed to fix this.
• Tubal sterilization—“Tying the tubes” is a surgical pro-
cedure and has all the risks of any other surgery, includ-ing the risks of anesthesia, infection, and bleeding.
Preparation"
"Preparation
No specific preparation is needed before using con-
traception. However, a woman must be sure that she isnot already pregnant before using a hormonal method orhaving an IUD placed.
Aftercare
No aftercare is needed.
Risks
Many methods of birth control have side effects.
Knowing the side effects can help a woman to determinewhich method of birth control is right for her.
• Hormonal methods—The hormones in birth control
pills, Depo Provera, and Norplant can cause changes inmenstrual periods, changes in mood, weight gain, acne ,
and headaches. In addition, it may take many months tobegin ovulating again once a woman stops using DepoProvera or Norplant.
• Barrier methods—A woman must insert the diaphragm
in just the right way to be sure that it works properly.Some women get more urinary tract infections if theyuse a diaphragm. This is because the diaphragm canpress against the urethra, the tube that connects thebladder to the outside."
"• Spermicides—Some women and men are allergic to
spermicides or find them irritating to the skin.
• IUD—The IUD is a foreign body that stays inside the
uterus, and the uterus tries to get it out. A woman mayhave heavier menstrual periods and more menstrualcramping with an IUD in place.

"• Tubal sterilization—Some women report increased
menstrual discomfort after tubal ligation . It is not
known if this is related to the tubal ligation itself.
There is no perfect form of birth control. Every
method has a small failure rate and side effects. Somemethods carry additional risks. However, every methodof birth control can be effective if used properly.

There are a number of pathologies and diseases that
can lead to joint contractures. The primary causes result-ing in a joint contraction are muscle imbalance, pain ,
prolonged bed rest, and immobilization. Because of thefrequency of fractures and surgery, immobilization is"
"the most frequent cause of joint contractures. Symptomsinclude a significant loss of motion to any specific jointthat results in immobility. If the contracture is of a signif-icant degree, pain can result even without any voluntaryjoint movement.
Diagnosis
Manual testing of joint mobility by a healthcare pro-
fessional skilled in joint mobilization techniques (e.g. aphysical therapist) will identify indications of restrictedstructures within the joint. Measuring the motion of thejoint with a device termed a “goniometer” can be usefulif the decrease of motion can be shown to be a provenresult of a joint contracture. X rays can be of some bene-fit in the diagnosis of contractures, because a visibledecrease in joint space may indicate a tight, contractedjoint. Most physicians will make the diagnosis after athorough physical examination involving physical and
manual testing of the joint motion.

"Treatment
Manual techniques
Joint mobilization and stretching of soft tissues is a
common technique used to increase joint elasticity.Structures are stretched in similar directions to thosewhich take place upon normal joint motion. Somehealthcare professionals may use some form of heat priorto the stretching and mobilization. If appropriate, exer-
cisemay follow manual techniques to help maintain the
additional motion achieved.
Mechanical techniques
Devices known as continuous passive motion
machines are very popular, especially following surgeryof joints. Continuous passive motion machines (CPM)are specifically adjusted to each individual’s need. Thismethod is administered within the first 24–72 hours afterthe injury or surgery. The joint is mechanically movedthrough the patient’s tolerable motion. CPM machineshave been proved to accelerate the return motion process,allowing patients more function in less time."

"Casting or splinting
Casting or splinting techniques are used to provide a
constant stretch to the soft tissues surrounding a joint. Itis most effective when used to increase motion of a jointfrom prolonged immobilization. It is also popular fortreating contractures resulting from an increase in muscletone from nerve injury. After an initial holding cast isapplied for seven to 10 days, a series of positional castsare applied at weekly intervals. Before the application ofeach new cast, the joint is moved as much as can be toler-ated by the patient, and measured by a goniometer. Whenas much motion as possible is obtained after stretching,another final cast is applied to maintain the newlyacquired motion.
Surgery
In some cases the contracture may be severe and not
respond to conservative treatment. In this event, manipu-lation of the joint under a general anesthesia may be nec-essary.

"Alternative treatment
In some areas of the body, chiropractic techniques
have been found to be useful to improve motion. Mas-
sage therapy can be beneficial by promoting additional
circulation to joint structures, causing better elasticity.Yoga can help prevent as well as rehabilitate a contrac-

Prognosis
Prognosis of contractures will depend upon the
cause of the contracture. In general, the earlier the treat-ment for the contracture begins, the better the prognosis.

"Cooling treatments
Definition
Cooling treatments lower body temperature in order
to relieve pain , swelling, constriction of blood vessels,
and to decrease the liklihood of cellular damage by slow-ing the metabolism. Sponge baths, cold compresses, andcold packs are all wet cooling treatments. Dry treat-ments, such as ice bags and chemical cold packs, are alsoused to lower body temperature.
Purpose
The most common reason for cooling a body is
fever or hyperthermia (extremely high fever). The body
can sustain temperatures up to 104°F (40°C) with rela-tive safety; however, when temperatures rise above104°F (40°C), damage to the brain, muscles, blood, andkidneys is increasingly likely. Cooling treatments arealso applied immediately following sprains, bruises ,
burns , eye injuries, and muscle spasms to help alleviate
the resulting swelling, pain, and discoloration of the skin.

"Cooling treatments slow chemical reactions within
the body. For this reason, cooling tissues below normaltemperature (98.6°F/37°C) can prevent injury from inad-equate oxygen or nutrition . Cold water drowning vic-
tims suffering from hypothermia (cooling of the body
below its normal temperature) have been successfullyresuscitated after long periods underwater without med-ical complications because of this effect. For the past 40years, heart surgeons have been experimenting withhypothermia to protect tissues from lack of blood circu-lation during an operation. Neurosurgeons are also work-ing with hypothermia to protect the very sensitive braintissues during periods of absent or reduced blood flow.

"methods are used.
• Cold packs and ice bags are placed on a localized site
and provide topical relief. These compresses should becovered with a waterproof material to protect the skin.Repeated treatments produce the desired pain andswelling relief.
• Cold treatments are placed on the groin and under the
arms to treat hyperthermia. Treatments are refreshedperiodically until the appropriate temperature is attained.
• A tepid sponge bath relieves fever without cooling the
body too fast. Eighty degrees Farenheit is still 20°Fbelow body temperature and yet warm enough not todrive blood from the skin, thereby preventing the cool-ing from getting to the body’s core. Limbs are bathedfirst and then the chest, abdomen, back, and buttocks.
• Perfusion of isolated regions like the brain by using
cooled blood is an experimental treatment, offeringpromising results for the treatment of stroke.

"Preparation
Topical treatments are prepared with ice, cold water
(59°F/15°C), and chemical cold packs. Tepid bathsshould be 80–93°F (26.7–34°C).
Risks
Small children, adults with circulation problems, and
the elderly are all at risk of tissue damage. Rapid coolingcauses chills, which in effect raise the body’s temperatureby raising its metabolism. Blood clots may form fromthickened blood caused by the temperature change.

Coombs’ tests
Definition
Coombs’ tests are blood tests that identify the causes
of anemia.
Purpose
Anemia, which literally means no blood, refers to
blood with abnormally low oxygen-carrying capacity.The hemoglobin in red blood cells carries oxygen. Oneof the many causes of anemia is destruction of red bloodcells, a process called hemolysis ( hemo means blood and
lysis means disintegration). A simple blood count
detects anemia. Even the test done before a blood dona-tion can identify anemia. To detect hemolysis requiresother tests. The Coombs’ tests are conducted in order todetermine the cause of anemia.
One characteristic of hemolysis is the autoimmune"
"One characteristic of hemolysis is the autoimmune
response against the body’s red blood cells. Instead ofprotecting the body from outside agents, the immunesystem attacks parts of its own body with a deluge ofantibodies. Autoimmunity is thought to be the cause ofmany collagen-vascular diseases, including rheumatoid
arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus . It is also
the cause of the autoimmune hemolytic anemias . The
Coombs’ tests detect the antibodies responsible for thedestruction of the red blood cells.
Causes of autoimmune hemolytic anemia include:
• drugs such as penicillin, methyldopa (lowers blood
pressure), and quinidine (treats heart rhythm distur-bances)
• cancers of the lymph system—Hodgkin’s disease and
lymphomas
• virus infections• collagen-vascular diseases
• mismatched blood transfusions• Rh incompatibility between a mother and fetus. This
disease is called erythroblastosis fetalis"

"Many times the cause cannot be identified.
Description
There are two Coombs’ tests. A direct Coombs’ test
detects the two different antigens that might inducehemolysis in the patient’s red blood cells. An indirectCoombs’ test looks for antibodies to someone else’s redblood cells in the patient’s serum (the blood without thecells). Combining the two tests gives clues to the originof the hemolysis.
Preparation
No preparation is needed for this test. It will proba-
bly be among the second or third set of blood tests doneafter anemia is diagnosed and there is a suspicion that itscause is hemolysis.
Aftercare
Coombs’ tests are done on blood that is drawn from
the arm.

"ease (COPD). In fact, about 85% of patients diagnosed
with cor pulmonale have COPD. Chronic bronchitis and
emphysema are types of COPD. High blood pressure in
the blood vessels of the lungs ( pulmonary hypertension )
causes the enlargement of the right ventricle. In additionto COPD, cor pulmonale may also be caused by lung dis-eases, such as cystic fibrosis ,pulmonary embolism, and
pneumoconiosis. Loss of lung tissue after lung surgery
or certain chest-wall disturbances can produce cor pul-monale, as can neuromuscular diseases, such as muscu-
lar dystrophy . A large pulmonary thromboembolism
(blood clot) may lead to acute cor pulmonale.

"Causes and symptoms
Any respiratory disease or malfunction that affects
the circulatory system of the lungs may lead to cor pul-monale. These circulatory changes cause the right ventri-cle to compensate for the extra work required to pumpblood through the lungs. The right ventricle has thinwalls and is crescent-shaped. The resulting pressurecauses the right ventricle to dilate and bulge, eventuallyleading to its failure.
Cor pulmonale should be expected in any patient
with COPD and other respiratory or neuromuscular dis-eases. Initial symptoms of cor pulmonale may actuallyreflect those of the underlying disease. These mayinclude chronic coughing, wheezing , weakness, fatigue ,
and shortness of breath . Edema (abnormal buildup of
fluid), weakness, and discomfort in the upper chest maybe evident in cor pulmonale.

An electrocardiograph (EKG) will show signs such
as frequent premature contractions in the atria or ventri-cles. Chest x rays may show enlargement of the rightdescending pulmonary artery. This sign, along with anenlarged main pulmonary artery, indicates pulmonaryartery hypertension in patients with COPD. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is often the preferred method
of diagnosis for cor pulmonale because it can clearlyshow and measure volume of the pulmonary arteries.Other tests used to support a diagnosis of cor pulmonalemay include arterial blood gas analysis , pulmonary
function tests, and hematocrit .

Corneal abrasion
Definition
A corneal abrasion is a worn or scraped-off area of
the outer, clear layer of the eye (cornea).
Description
The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer area of
the eye. It lies in front of the colored part of the eye (iris)and the black hole in the iris (pupil). The outermost layerof the eyeball consists of the cornea and the white part ofthe eye (sclera). A corneal abrasion is basically a superfi-cial cut or scrape on the cornea. A corneal abrasion is notas serious as a corneal ulcer, which is generally deeperand more severe than an abrasion.
Causes and symptoms
A corneal abrasion is usually the result of direct injury"
"Causes and symptoms
A corneal abrasion is usually the result of direct injury
to the eye, often from a fingernail scratch, makeup brushes,contact lenses, foreign body, or even twigs. Patients oftencomplain of feeling a foreign body in their eye, and theymay have pain, sensitivity to light, or tearing.
Diagnosis
Ophthalmologists and optometrists, who treat eye
disorders, are well qualified to diagnose corneal abra-sions. The doctor will check the patient’s vision (visualacuity) in both eyes with an eye chart. A patient historywill also be taken, which may help to determine thecause of the abrasion. A slit lamp, which is basically amicroscope and light source, will allow the doctor to seethe abrasion. Fluorescein, a yellow dye, may be placedinto the eye to determine the extent of the abrasion. Thefluorescein will temporarily stain the affected area.

"Treatment
The cornea has a remarkable ability to heal itself, so
treatment is designed to minimize complications. If theabrasion is very small, the doctor might just suggest aneye lubricant and a follow-up visit the next day. A verysmall abrasion should heal in one to two days; othersusually in one week. However, to avoid a possible infec-tion, an antibiotic eye drop may be prescribed. Some-times additional eye drops may make the eye feel morecomfortable. Depending upon the extent of the abrasion,some doctors may patch the affected eye. It is veryimportant to go for the follow-up checkup to make surean infection does not occur. Use of contact lenses shouldnot be resumed without the doctor’s approval.

"Prognosis
In typical cases, the prognosis is good. The cornea
will heal itself, usually within several days. A very deepabrasion may lead to scarring. If the abrasion does notheal properly, a recurrent corneal erosion (RCE) mayresult months or even years later. The symptoms are thesame as for an abrasion (e.g., tearing, foreign body sensa-tion, and blurred vision), but it will keep occurring. Simi-lar or additional treatment for the RCE may be necessary.
Prevention
Everyone should wear eye protection whenever this
is recommended. This should be standard practice whenusing power tools and playing certain sports. Gogglesshould even be worn when mowing the lawn, because atwig can be thrown upward toward the face. Contact lenswearers should be careful to follow their doctors’ instruc-tions on caring for and wearing their lenses. Ill-fitting ordirty lenses could lead to an abrasion, so patients shouldgo for their prescribed checkups."

Corneal transplantation
Definition
In corneal transplant, also known as keratoplasty, a
patient’s damaged cornea is replaced by the cornea fromthe eye of a human cadaver. This is the single most com-mon type of human transplant surgery and has the high-est success rate. Eye banks acquire and store eyes fromdonor individuals largely to supply the need for trans-plant corneas.

"Purpose
Corneal transplant is used when vision is lost in an
eye because the cornea has been damaged by disease ortraumatic injury. Some of the disease conditions thatmight require corneal transplant include the bulging out-ward of the cornea (keratoconus), a malfunction of theinner layer of the cornea (Fuchs’ dystrophy), and painfulswelling of the cornea (pseudophakic bullous keratopa-thy). Some of these conditions cause cloudiness of thecornea; others alter its natural curvature, which can alsoreduce the quality of vision.
Injury to the cornea can occur because of chemical
burns , mechanical trauma, or infection by viruses, bacte-
ria, fungi, or protozoa. The herpes virus produces one ofthe more common infections leading to corneal transplant.
Surgery would only be used when damage to the
cornea is too severe to be treated with corrective lenses.Occasionally, corneal transplant is combined with othertypes of eye surgery (such as cataract surgery ) to solve"
"multiple eye problems in one procedure.Precautions
Corneal transplant is a very safe procedure that can
be performed on almost any patient who would benefitfrom it. Any active infection or inflammation of the eyeusually needs to be brought under control before surgerycan be performed.
Description
The cornea is the transparent layer of tissue at the
very front of the eye. It is composed almost entirely of aspecial type of collagen. It normally contains no bloodvessels, but because it contains nerve endings, damage tothe cornea can be very painful.
In a corneal transplant, a disc of tissue is removed"
"In a corneal transplant, a disc of tissue is removed
from the center of the eye and replaced by a correspond-ing disc from a donor eye. The circular incision is madeusing an instrument called a trephine. In one form ofcorneal transplant (penetrating keratoplasty), the discremoved is the entire thickness of the cornea and so is thereplacement disc. Over 90% of all corneal transplants inthe United States are of this type. In lamellar keratoplas-ty, on the other hand, only the outer layer of the cornea isremoved and replaced.
The donor cornea is attached with extremely fine
sutures. Surgery can be performed under anesthesia that isconfined to one area of the body while the patient isawake (local anesthesia) or under anesthesia that placesthe entire body of the patient in a state of unconsciousness(general anesthesia.) Surgery requires 30–90 minutes.

"Over 40,000 corneal transplants are performed in the
United States each year. Medicare reimbursement for acorneal transplant in one eye was about $1,200 in 1997.

atophakia involves suturing the donor cornea directly

"onto the surface of the existing host cornea. The only tis-
sue removed from the host is the extremely thin epithe-lial cell layer on the outside of the host cornea. There isno permanent damage to the host cornea, and this proce-dure can be reversed. It is usually employed in children.In adults, the use of contact lenses can usually achievethe same goals.
Preparation
No special preparation for corneal transplant is need-
ed. Some eye surgeons may request the patient have a com-plete physical examination before surgery. The patient
may also be asked to skip breakfast on the day of surgery.
Aftercare
Corneal transplant is often performed on an outpa-
tient basis, although some patients need brief hospitaliza-tion after surgery. The patient will wear an eye patch atleast overnight. An eye shield or glasses must be worn toprotect the eye until the surgical wound has healed. Eyedrops will be prescribed for the patient to use for severalweeks after surgery. These drops include antibiotics to"
"prevent infection as well as corticosteroids to reduce
inflammation and prevent graft rejection.KEY TERMS

"Sutures are often left in place for six months, and

Risks
Corneal transplants are highly successful, with over
90% of operations in United States achieving restorationof sight. However, there is always some risk associatedwith any surgery. Complications that can occur includeinfection, glaucoma ,retinal detachment , cataract for-
mation, and rejection of the donor cornea.
Graft rejection occurs in 5–30% of patients, a com-
plication possible with any procedure involving tissuetransplantation from another person (allograft). Allograftrejection results from a reaction of the patient’s immunesystem to the donor tissue. Cell surface proteins calledhistocompatibility antigens trigger this reaction. Theseantigens are often associated with vascular tissue (bloodvessels) within the graft tissue. Since the cornea normal-ly contains no blood vessels, it experiences a very lowrate of rejection. Generally, blood typing and tissue typ-"
"ingare not needed in corneal transplants, and no close
match between donor and recipient is required. Symp-

"toms of rejection include persistent discomfort, sensitivi-
ty to light, redness, or a change in vision.
If a rejection reaction does occur, it can usually be
blocked by steroid treatment. Rejection reactions maybecome noticeable within weeks after surgery, but maynot occur until 10 or even 20 years after the transplant.When full rejection does occur, the surgery will usuallyneed to be repeated.
Although the cornea is not normally vascular, some
corneal diseases cause vascularization (the growth ofblood vessels) into the cornea. In patients with these con-ditions, careful testing of both donor and recipient is per-formed just as in transplantation of other organs and tis-sues such as hearts, kidneys, and bone marrow. In suchpatients, repeated surgery is sometimes necessary inorder to achieve a successful transplant.

Corneal ulcers
Definition
The cornea, the clear front part of the eye through
which light passes, is subject to many infections and toinjury from exposure and from foreign objects . Infection
and injury cause inflammation of the cornea—a condi-tion called keratitis . Tissue loss because of inflamma-
tion produces an ulcer. The ulcer can either be centrallylocated, thus greatly affecting vision, or peripherallylocated. There are about 30,000 cases of bacterial cornealulcers in the United States each year.

"Description
The most common cause of corneal ulcers is germs,
but most of them cannot invade a healthy cornea withadequate tears and a functioning eyelid. They gain accessbecause injury has impaired these defense mechanisms.A direct injury from a foreign object inoculates germsdirectly through the outer layer of the cornea, just as itdoes to the skin. A caustic chemical can inflame thecornea by itself or so damage it that germs can invade.Improper use of contact lenses has become a commoncause of corneal injury. Eyelid or tear function failure isthe other way to make the eye vulnerable to infection.Tears and the eyelid together wash the eye and preventforeign material from settling in. Tears contain enzymesand other substances to help protect against infection.Certain diseases dry up tear production, leaving thecornea dry and defenseless. Other diseases paralyze orweaken the eyelids so that they cannot effectively protectand cleanse the eyes.
Causes and symptoms"
"Causes and symptoms
Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and a protozoan called
Acanthamoeba can all invade the cornea and damage it
under suitable conditions.
• Bacteria from a common conjunctivitis (pink eye)
rarely spread to the cornea, but can if untreated.

"• Fecal bacteria are more likely to be able to infect the
cornea.
• A bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa , which
can contaminate eyedrops, is particularly able to causecorneal infection.
• A group of incomplete bacteria known as Chlamydia
can be transmitted to the eye directly by flies or dirtyhands. One form of chlamydial infection is the leadingcause of blindness in developing countries and is knownas Egyptian ophthalmia or trachoma . Another type of
Chlamydia causes a sexually transmitted disease.
• Other sexually transmitted diseases—for example,
syphilis—can affect the cornea.
The most common viruses to damage the cornea are
adenoviruses and herpes viruses. Viral and fungal infec-tions are often caused by improper use of topical corti-
costeroids . If topical corticosteroids are used in a patient
with herpes simplex keratitis, the ulcer can get muchworse and blindness could result.

"Symptoms are obvious. The cornea is intensely sen-
sitive, so corneal ulcers normally produce severe pain . If
the corneal ulcer is centrally located, vision is impairedor completely absent. Tearing is present and the eye isred. It hurts to look at bright lights.
Diagnosis
The doctor will take a case history to try to deter-
mine the cause of the ulcer. This can include improperuse of contact lenses; injury, such as a scratch from atwig; or severe dry eye. An instrument called a slit lampwill be used to examine the cornea. The slit lamp is amicroscope with a light source that magnifies the cornea,allowing the extent of the ulcer to be seen. Fluorescein, ayellow dye, may be used to illuminate further detail. If agerm is responsible for the ulcer, identification mayrequire scraping samples directly from the cornea, con-junctiva, and lids, and sending them to the laboratory.KEY TERMS

Topical corticosteroids —Cortisone and related

A corneal ulcer needs to be treated aggressively, as it
can result in loss of vision. The first step is to eliminateinfection. Broad spectrum antibiotics will be used
before the lab results come back. Medications may thenbe changed to more specifically target the cause of theinfection. A combination of medications may be neces-sary. Patients should return for their follow-up visits sothat the doctor can monitor the healing process. Thecornea can heal from many insults, but if it remainsscarred, corneal transplantation may be necessary to
restore vision. If the corneal ulcer is large, hospitaliza-tion may be necessary.

"Prognosis
Treated early enough, corneal infections will usually
resolve, perhaps even without the formation of an ulcer.However, left untreated, infections can lead to ulcers andthe corneal ulcer can result in scarring or perforation ofthe cornea. Other problems may occur as well, includingglaucoma . Patients with certain systemic diseases that
impede healing (such as diabetes mellitus or rheuma-
toid arthritis ) may need more aggressive treatment. The

"Prevention
Attentive care of contact lenses will greatly reduce
the incidence of corneal damage and ulceration. Germsthat cause no problems in the mouth or on the hands candamage the eye, so contact lens wearers must wash theirhands before touching their lenses and must not use sali-va to moisten them. Tap water should not be used to rinsethe lenses. Contacts should be removed whenever thereis irritation and left out until the eyes are back to normal.It is not advisable to wear contact lenses while swim-ming or in hot tubs. Daily wear contact lenses have beenfound to be less of a risk than contacts for overnight wear(extended wear). Organisms have been cultured fromcontact lens cases, so the cases should be rinsed in hotwater and allowed to air dry. Cases should be replacedevery three months. Patients should follow their doctors’schedules for replacement of the contacts.

Corns and calluses
Definition
A corn is a small, painful, raised bump on the outer
skin layer. A callus is a rough, thickened patch of skin.
Description
Corns and calluses are one of the three major foot"
"Description
Corns and calluses are one of the three major foot
problems in the United States. The other two are footinfections and toenail problems. Corns and callusesaffect about 5% of the population.
Corns usually appear on non-weight-bearing areas
like the outside of the little toe or the tops of other toes.Women have corns more often than men, probablybecause women wear high-heeled shoes and other shoesthat do not fit properly. Corns have hard cores shapedlike inverted pyramids. Sharp pain occurs whenever
downward pressure is applied, and a dull ache may befelt at other times.
Calluses occur most often on the heels and balls of
the feet, the knees, and the palms of the hands. However,they can develop on any part of the body that is subject torepeated pressure or irritation. Calluses are usually morethan an inch wide—larger than corns. They generallydon’t hurt unless pressure is applied.Types of corns
A hard corn is a compact lump with a thick core."
"A hard corn is a compact lump with a thick core.
Hard corns usually form on the tops of the toes, on theoutside of the little toe, or on the sole of the foot.
A soft corn is a small, inflamed patch of skin with a
smooth center. Soft corns usually appear between the toes.
A seed corn is the least common type of corn.
Occurring only on the heel or ball of the foot, a seed cornconsists of a circle of stiff skin surrounding a plug ofcholesterol.
Types of calluses
A plantar callus, a callus that occurs on the sole of
the foot, has a white center. Hereditary calluses developwhere there is no apparent friction, run in families, andoccur most often in children.
Causes and symptoms
Corns and calluses form to prevent injury to skin
that is repeatedly pinched, rubbed, or irritated. The mostcommon causes are:
• shoes that are too tight or too loose, or have very high
heels
• tight socks or stockings
• deformed toes

"• walking down a long hill, or standing or walking on a
hard surface for a long time
Jobs or hobbies that cause steady or recurring pres-
sure on the same spot can also cause calluses.
Symptoms include hard growths on the skin in
response to direct pressure. Corns may be extremely soreand surrounded by inflamed, swollen skin.
Diagnosis
Corns can be recognized on sight. A family physi-
cian or podiatrist may scrape skin off what seems to be acallus, but may actually be a wart. If the lesion is a wart,it will bleed. A callus will not bleed, but will revealanother layer of dead skin.
Treatment
Corns and calluses do not usually require medical
attention unless the person who has them has diabetes
mellitus , poor circulation, or other problems that make
self-care difficult.

"self-care difficult.
Treatment should begin as soon as an abnormality
appears. The first step is to identify and eliminate thesource of pressure. Placing moleskin pads over corns canrelieve pressure, and large wads of cotton, lamb’s wool,or moleskin can cushion calluses.
Using hydrocortisone creams or soaking feet in a
solution of Epsom salts and very warm water for at leastfive minutes a day before rubbing the area with a pumicestone will remove part or all of some calluses. Rubbingcorns just makes them hurt more.
Applying petroleum jelly or lanolin-enriched hand
lotion helps keep skin soft, but corn-removing ointmentsthat contain acid can damage healthy skin. They shouldnever be used by pregnant women or by people who arediabetic or who have poor circulation.KEY TERMS

Bursitis —Inflammation of a bursa, a fluid-filled
cavity or sac. In the body, bursae are located atplaces where friction might otherwise develop.It is important to see a doctor if the skin of a corn or
callus is cut, because it may become infected. If a corndischarges pus or clear fluid, it is infected. A familyphysician, podiatrist, or orthopedist may:

Patterning , the Feldenkrais method , and rolfing , that
manipulate the body through massage, movement educa-tion, or meditational techniques.
Aloe ( Aloe barbadensis ) cream is an effective skin
softener, and two or three daily applications of calendu-la (Calendula officinalis ) salve can soften skin and pre-
vent inflammation. One teaspoon of lemon juice mixedwith one teaspoon of dried chamomile ( Martricaria

• bandage overnight• soak in warm water for 10 minutes every morning• massage gently with mustard ( Brassica cruciferae ) oil
Prognosis
Most corns and calluses disappear about three weeks
after the pressure that caused them is eliminated. Theyare apt to recur if the pressure returns.
Extreme pain can change the way a person stands or
walks. Such changes can, in turn, cause pain in the ankle,back, hip, or knee.
Bursitis , a painful, inflamed fluid-filled sac, can
develop beneath a corn. An ulcer or broken area within acorn can reach to the bone. Infection can have seriousconsequences for people who have diabetes or poor cir-culation.

"Prevention
Corns and calluses can usually be prevented by avoid-
ing friction-causing activities and wearing shoes that fitproperly, are activity-appropriate, and are kept in goodrepair. Soles and heels that wear unevenly may indicate aneed for corrective footwear or special insoles. Socks andstockings should not cramp the toes. Gloves, kneepads,and other protective gear should also be worn as needed.
Feet should be measured, while standing, whenever
buying new shoes. It is best to shop for shoes late in theday, when feet are likely to be swollen. It is also impor-tant to buy shoes with toe-wiggling room and to try newshoes on both feet.

Coronary artery bypass graft
surgery
Definition
Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a surgical
procedure in which one or more blocked coronary arter-ies are bypassed by a blood vessel graft to restore normalblood flow to the heart. These grafts usually come fromthe patient’s own arteries and veins located in the leg,arm, or chest.
Purpose
Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (also called"
"Purpose
Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (also called
coronary artery bypass surgery, CABG, and bypass oper-ation) is performed to restore blood flow to the heart.This relieves chest pain and ischemia , improves the
patient’s quality of life, and in some cases, prolongs thepatient’s life. The goals of the procedure are to enable thepatient to resume a normal lifestyle and to lower the riskof a heart attack .
The decision to perform coronary artery bypass graft
surgery is a complex one, and there is some disagreementamong experts as to when it is indicated. Many expertsfeel that it has been performed too frequently in the Unit-ed States. According to the American Heart Association,appropriate candidates for coronary artery bypass graftsurgery include patients with blockages in at least threemajor coronary arteries, especially if the blockages are inarteries that feed the heart’s left ventricle; patients withangina so severe that even mild exertion causes chest"
"pain; and patients who cannot tolerate percutaneous trans-luminal coronary angioplasty and do not respond well to
drug therapy. It is well accepted that coronary arterybypass graft surgery is the treatment of choice for patientswith severe coronary artery disease (three or more dis-
eased arteries with impaired function in the left ventricle).
Precautions
Coronary artery bypass graft surgery should ideally
be postponed for three months after a heart attack. Patientsshould be medically stable before the surgery, if possible.
Description
Coronary artery bypass graft surgery builds a detour
around one or more blocked coronary arteries with agraft from a healthy vein or artery. The graft goes aroundthe clogged artery (or arteries) to create new pathwaysfor oxygen-rich blood to flow to the heart.
Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is major surgery"
"Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is major surgery
performed in a hospital. The length of the proceduredepends upon the number of arteries being bypassed, but itgenerally  takes from four to six hours—sometimes longer.The average hospital stay is four to seven days. Full recov-ery from coronary artery bypass graft surgery takes three tofour months. Within four to six weeks, people with seden-tary office jobs can return to work; people with physicaljobs must wait longer and sometimes change careers.
Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is widely per-
formed in the United States. The American Heart Associ-ation estimates that 573,000 coronary artery bypass graftsurgeries were performed on 363,000 patients in 1995.Seventy-four percent of these procedures were per-formed on men and 44% on men and women under theage of 65 (1995 data). The estimated average cost of thisprocedure in 1995 was $44,820."

"Procedure
The surgery team for coronary artery bypass graft"
"surgery includes the cardiovascular surgeon, assisting sur-geons, a cardiovascular anesthesiologist, a perfusion tech-nologist (who operates the heart-lung machine), and spe-cially trained nurses. After general anesthesia is adminis-tered, the surgeon removes the veins or prepares the arter-ies for grafting. If the saphenous vein is to be used, a seriesof incisions are made in the patient’s thigh or calf. Morecommonly, a segment of the internal mammary artery willbe used and the incisions are made in the chest wall. Thesurgeon then makes an incision from the patient’s neck tonavel, saws through the breastbone, and retracts the ribcage open to expose the heart. The patient is connected toa heart-lung machine, also called a cardiopulmonarybypass pump, that cools the body to reduce the need foroxygen and takes over for the heart and lungs during theprocedure. The heart is then stopped and a cold solution ofpotassium-enriched normal saline is injected into the aor-tic root and the"
"and a cold solution ofpotassium-enriched normal saline is injected into the aor-tic root and the coronary arteries to lower the temperatureof the heart, which prevents damage to the tissue."
"Next, a small opening is made just below the block-
age in the diseased coronary artery. Blood will be redirect-ed through this opening once the graft is sewn in place. If a
leg vein is used, one end is connected to the coronaryartery and the other to the aorta. If a mammary artery isused, one end is connected to the coronary artery while theother remains attached to the aorta. The procedure isrepeated on as many coronary arteries as necessary. Mostpatients who have coronary artery bypass graft surgeryhave at least three grafts done during the procedure.
Electric shocks start the heart pumping again after
the grafts have been completed. The heart-lung machineis turned off and the blood slowly returns to normal bodytemperature. After implanting pacing electrodes (if need-ed) and inserting a chest tube, the surgeon closes thechest cavity.

"About 90% of patients experience significant improve-
ments after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Patientsexperience full relief from chest pain and resume their nor-mal activities in about 70% of the cases; the remaining20% experience partial relief. In 5–10% of coronary arterybypass graft surgeries, the bypass graft stops supplyingblood to the bypassed artery within one year. Younger peo-

"ple who are healthy except for the heart disease do well
with bypass surgery. Patients who have poorer results fromcoronary artery bypass graft surgery include those over theage of 70, those who have poor left ventricular function, orare undergoing a repeat surgery or other procedures con-currently, and those who continue smoking , do not treat
high cholesterol or other coronary risk factors, or have
another debilitating disease.
Long term, symptoms recur in only about 3–4% of
patients per year. Five years after coronary artery bypassgraft surgery, survival expectancy is 90%, at 10 years it isabout 80%, at 15 years it is about 55%, and at 20 years itis about 40%.

"Angina recurs in about 40% of patients after about
10 years. In most cases, it is less severe than before thesurgery and can be controlled by drug therapy. In patientswho have had vein grafts, 40% of the grafts are severelyobstructed 10 years after the procedure. Repeat coronaryartery bypass graft surgery may be necessary, and is usu-ally less successful than the first surgery.

"surgery
There are two new types of minimally invasive coro-
nary artery bypass graft surgery: port-access coronaryartery bypass (also called PACAB or PortCAB) and min-imally invasive coronary artery bypass (also called MID-CAB). These procedures are minimally invasive becausethey do not require the neck-to-navel incision, sawingthrough the breastbone, or opening the rib cage to exposethe heart. Both procedures enable surgeons to work onthe coronary arteries through small chest holes calledports and other small incisions. Port-access coronaryartery bypass requires the use of a heart-lung machinebut minimally invasive coronary artery bypass does not.Advantages of these procedures over standard coronaryartery bypass graft surgery include a shorter hospitalstay, a shorter recovery period, and lower costs.
Port-access coronary artery bypass enables surgeons"
"Port-access coronary artery bypass enables surgeons
to perform bypasses through smaller incisions. Using avideo monitor to view the procedure, the surgeon passesinstruments through ports in the patient’s chest to per-form the bypass. Mammary arteries or leg veins are usedfor the grafts. Minimally invasive coronary artery bypassis performed on a beating heart and is appropriate onlyfor bypasses of one or two arteries. Small ports are madein the patient’s chest, along with a small incision directlyover the coronary artery to be bypassed. Generally, thesurgeon uses a mammary artery for the bypass.
Early data on outcomes for port-access coronary artery
bypass and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass arefavorable. Mortality rates with port-access coronary arterybypass and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass are"
"both less than 3%—about the same as in standard coronaryartery bypass graft surgery. One clinical trial indicated thatsurvival at seven years was the same in minimally invasivecoronary artery bypass and standard coronary artery bypassgraft surgery, but that another intervention was necessaryfive times more often with minimally invasive coronaryartery bypass than with standard coronary artery bypassgraft surgery. The American Heart Association Council onCardio-Thoracic and Vascular Surgery feels that both pro-cedures appear promising but that further study is needed.More data covering longer term outcomes are necessary inorder to fully assess these procedures.
Preparation
The patient is usually admitted to the hospital the
day before the coronary artery bypass graft surgery isscheduled. Coronary angiography has been previously"
"performed to show the surgeon where the arteries areblocked and where the grafts might best be positioned.The patient is given a blood-thinning drug—usuallyheparin—that helps to prevent blood clots. The eveningbefore the surgery, the patient showers with antisepticsoap and is shaved from chin to toes. After midnight,food and fluids are restricted. A sedative is prescribed onthe morning of surgery and sometimes the night before.Heart monitoring begins.
Aftercare
The patient recovers in a surgical intensive care unit"
"Aftercare
The patient recovers in a surgical intensive care unit
for at least the first two days after the surgery. He or she isconnected to chest and breathing tubes, a mechanical venti-lator, a heart monitor and other monitoring equipment, anda urinary catheter. The breathing tube and ventilator areusually removed within six hours of surgery, but the othertubes remain in place as long as the patient is in the inten-sive care unit. Drugs are prescribed to control pain and toprevent unwanted blood clotting. The patient is closelymonitored. Vital signs and other parameters, such as heartsounds and oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in arterialblood, are checked frequently. The chest tube is checked toensure that it is draining properly. The patient is fed intra-venously for the first day or two. Daily doses of aspirin are"
"started within six to 24 hours after the procedure. Chestphysiotherapy is started after the ventilator and breathingtube are removed. The therapy includes coughing, turningfrequently, and taking deep breaths. Other exercises will beencouraged to improve the patient’s circulation and preventcomplications due to prolonged bed rest.
If there are no complications, the patient begins to
resume a normal routine around the second day. Thisincludes eating regular food, sitting up, and walking

"around a little bit. Before being released from the hospi-
tal, the patient usually spends a few days under observa-tion in a non-surgical unit. During this time, counseling isusually provided on eating right and starting a light exer-
ciseprogram to keep the heart healthy. Patients should eat
a lot of fruits, vegetables, grains, and non-fat or low-fatdairy products, and reduce fats to less than 30% of allcalories. An exercise program will usually be tailored forthe patient, who will be encouraged to participate in acardiac rehabilitation program where exercise will be
supervised by professionals. Cardiac rehabilitation pro-
grams, offered by hospitals and other organizations, mayalso include classes on heart-healthy living.
Full recovery from coronary artery bypass graft"
"Full recovery from coronary artery bypass graft
surgery takes three to four months and is a gradualprocess. Upon release from the hospital, the patient willfeel weak because of the extended bed rest in the hospi-tal. Within a few weeks, the patient should begin to feelstronger.
While the incision scar from coronary artery bypass
graft surgery heals, which takes one to two months, itmay be sore. The scar should not be bumped, scratched,or otherwise disturbed. An exercise test is often conduct-ed after the patient leaves the hospital to determine howeffective the surgery was and to confirm that progressiveexercise is safe.

mulation of fatty materials on the inner linings of arter-ies. The resulting blockage restricts blood flow to theheart. When the blood flow is completely cut off, theresult is a heart attack .
Description
Coronary artery disease, also called coronary heart
disease or heart disease, is the leading cause of death for
both men and women in the United States. According tothe American Heart Association, in 1995 one in every 4.8deaths in the United States was caused by coronary arterydisease. About every 29 seconds, one American will havea heart attack; about every minute, one American will diefrom a heart attack. Fourteen million Americans haveactive symptoms of coronary artery disease (heart attackor chest pains). Many millions more have silent coronarydisease, the first indication of which can be sudden death.
Coronary artery disease occurs when the coronary"
"Coronary artery disease occurs when the coronary
arteries become partially blocked or clogged. This block-age limits the flow of blood from the coronary arteries,which are the major arteries supplying oxygen-rich bloodto the heart. The coronary arteries expand when the heartis working harder and needs more oxygen. Arterieswould expand, for example, when a person is climbingstairs, exercising, or having sex. If the arteries are unableto expand, the heart is deprived of oxygen (myocardialischemia ). When the blockage is limited, chest pain or
pressure, called angina, may occur. When the blockage
cuts off the flow of blood, the result is heart attack(myocardial infarction or heart muscle death).
Healthy coronary arteries are clean, smooth, and"
"Healthy coronary arteries are clean, smooth, and
slick. The artery walls are flexible and can expand to letmore blood through when the heart needs to work harder.The disease process in arteries is thought to begin withan injury to the linings and walls of the arteries. Thisinjury makes them susceptible to atherosclerosis andblood clots (thrombosis).
Causes and symptoms
Coronary artery disease is usually caused by athero-
sclerosis. Cholesterol and other fatty substances accumu-late on the inner wall of the arteries. They attract fibroustissue, blood components, and calcium and harden intoartery-clogging plaques. Atherosclerotic plaques oftenform blood clots that can also block the coronary arteries(coronary thrombosis). Congenital defects and musclespasms can also block blood flow. Recent research indi-cates that infection from organisms such as chlamydiabacteria may be responsible for some cases of coronaryartery disease.A number of major contributing factors increase the"
"risk of developing coronary artery disease. Some of thesecan be changed and some cannot. People with more riskfactors are more likely to develop coronary artery disease.
Major risk factors
Major risk factors significantly increase the chance
of developing coronary artery disease. Those that cannotbe changed are:
• Heredity—People whose parents have coronary artery
disease are more likely to develop it. African-Ameri-cans are also at increased risk because they experiencea higher rate of severe hypertension than whites do.
• Sex—Men are more likely to have heart attacks than
women are and to have them at a younger age. Over age60, however, women have coronary artery disease at arate equal to that of men.
• Age—Men who are 45 years of age and older and"
"• Age—Men who are 45 years of age and older and
women who are 55 years of age and older are morelikely to have coronary artery disease. Occasionally,coronary disease may strike a person in the 30s. Olderpeople (those over 65) are more likely to die of a heartattack. Older women are twice as likely as older men todie within a few weeks of a heart attack.
Major risk factors that can be changed are:
• Smoking—Smoking increases both the chance of
developing coronary artery disease and the chance ofdying from it. Smokers are two to four times more like-ly than are non-smokers to die of sudden heart attack.They are more than twice as likely as non-smokers tohave a heart attack. They are also more likely to diewithin an hour of a heart attack. Second hand smokemay also increase risk.
• High cholesterol—Dietary sources of cholesterol are"
"• High cholesterol—Dietary sources of cholesterol are
meat, eggs, and other animal products. The body alsoproduces it. Age, sex, heredity, and diet affect one’sblood cholesterol. Total blood cholesterol is consideredhigh at levels above 240 mg/dL and borderline at 200-239 mg/dL. High-risk levels of low-density lipoprotein(LDL cholesterol) begin at 130–159 mg/dL, dependingon other risk factors. Risk of developing coronaryartery disease increases steadily as blood cholesterollevels increase above 160 mg/dL. When a person hasother risk factors, the risk multiplies.
• High blood pressure—High blood pressure makes the
heart work harder and weakens it over time. It increasesthe risk of heart attack, stroke , kidney failure, and con-
gestive heart failure . A blood pressure of 140 over 90
or above is considered high. As the numbers rise, highblood pressure goes from Stage 1 (mild) to Stage 4(very severe). In combination with obesity ,smoking ,"
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 929Coronary artery diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 929
"high cholesterol , or diabetes, high blood pressure rais-
es the risk of heart attack or stroke several times.
• Lack of physical activity—Lack of exercise increases
the risk of coronary artery disease. Even modest physi-cal activity, like walking, is beneficial if done regularly.
• Diabetes mellitus—The risk of developing coronary
artery disease is seriously increased for diabetics. Morethan 80% of diabetics die of some type of heart orblood vessel disease.
Contributing risk factors
Contributing risk factors have been linked to coro-
nary artery disease, but their significance is not knownyet. Contributing risk factors are:
• Obesity—Excess weight increases the strain on the
heart and increases the risk of developing coronaryartery disease even if no other risk factors are present.Obesity increases blood pressure and blood cholesteroland can lead to diabetes.
•Stress and anger—Some scientists believe that stress"
"•Stress and anger—Some scientists believe that stress
and anger can contribute to the development of coro-nary artery disease and increase the blood’s tendency toform clots (thrombosis). Stress, the mental and physicalreaction to life’s irritations and challenges, increasesthe heart rate and blood pressure and can injure the lin-ing of the arteries. Evidence shows that anger increasesthe risk of dying from heart disease. The risk of heartattack is more than double after an episode of anger.
Chest pain (angina) is the main symptom of coro-
nary heart disease but it is not always present. Othersymptoms include shortness of breath , chest heaviness,"
"tightness, pain, a burning sensation, squeezing, or pres-sure either behind the breastbone or in the arms, neck, orjaws. Many people have no symptoms of coronary arterydisease before having a heart attack; 63% of women and48% of men who died suddenly of coronary artery dis-ease had no previous symptoms of the disease, accordingto the American Heart Association.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis begins with a visit to the physician, who
will take a medical history, discuss symptoms, listen tothe heart, and perform basic screening tests. These testswill measure weight, blood pressure, blood lipid levels,and fasting blood glucose levels. Other diagnostic tests
include resting and exercise electrocardiogram, echocar-
diography , radionuclide scans, and coronary angiogra-
phy. The treadmill exercise (stress) test is an appropriate
screening test for those with high risk factors even whenthey feel well.An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart’s"
"activity and may reveal a lack of oxygen (ischemia).Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed onthe patient’s chest, arms, and legs. They send impulses ofthe heart’s activity through an oscilloscope (a monitor) toa recorder that traces them on paper. The test takes about10 minutes and is performed in a physician’s office. Adefinite diagnosis cannot be made from electrocardiog-
raphy . About 50% of patients with significant coronary
artery disease have normal resting electrocardiograms.Another type of electrocardiogram, known as the exer-cise stress test , measures how the heart and blood ves-
sels respond to exertion when the patient is exercising ona treadmill or a stationary bike. This test is performed ina physician’s office or an exercise laboratory. It takes15–30 minutes. It is not perfectly accurate. It sometimesgives a normal reading when the patient has a heart prob-lem or an abnormal reading when the patient does not.
If the electrocardiogram reveals a problem or is"
"If the electrocardiogram reveals a problem or is
inconclusive, the next step is exercise echocardiographyor nuclear scanning (angiography). Echocardiography,cardiac ultrasound, uses sound waves to create an imageof the heart’s chambers and valves. A technician appliesgel to a hand-held transducer, then presses it against thepatient’s chest. The heart’s sound waves are convertedinto an image that can be displayed on a monitor. It doesnot reveal the coronary arteries themselves, but candetect abnormalities in heart wall motion caused by coro-nary disease. Performed in a cardiology outpatient diag-nostic laboratory, the test takes 30–60 minutes.

"Radionuclide angiography enables physicians to see
the blood flow of the coronary arteries. Nuclear scans areperformed by injecting a small amount of radiopharma-ceutical such as thallium into the bloodstream. A devicethat uses gamma rays to produce an image of the radioac-tive material (gamma camera) records pictures of theheart. Radionuclide scans are not dangerous. The radia-tion exposure is about the same as that in a chest x ray .
The tiny amount of radioactive material used disappearsfrom the body in a few days. Radionuclide scans costabout four times as much as exercise stress tests but pro-vide more information.

"In radionuclide angiography, a scanning camera

Thallium scanning is usually done in conjunc-tion with an exercise stress test. When the stress test isfinished, thallium or sestamibi is injected. The patientresumes exercise for one minute to absorb the thallium.For patients who cannot exercise, cardiac blood flow andheart rate may be increased by intravenous dipyridamole(Persantine) or adenosine. Thallium scanning is done

cal and again four hours (and maybe 24 hours) later. It isusually performed in a hospital’s nuclear medicinedepartment. Each scan takes 30–60 minutes.

A contrast dye is injected to makethe heart visible on x-ray cinematography. Coronaryangiography is performed in a cardiac catheterizationlaboratory either in an outpatient or inpatient surgeryunit. It takes from 30 minutes to two hours.

disease is a chronic disease requiring lifelong care.Angioplasty or bypass surgery is not a “cure.”
People with less severe coronary artery disease may
gain adequate control through lifestyle changes and drug
therapy. Many of the lifestyle changes that prevent dis-ease progression—a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, weightloss if needed, exercise, and not smoking—also help pre-vent the disease from developing. These lifestyle changesare discussed in more detail under prevention.

"Drugs such as nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium-
channel blockers relieve chest pain and complications ofcoronary artery disease, but they cannot clear blockedarteries. Nitrates (nitroglycerin) improve blood flow tothe heart. Beta-blockers (acebutelol, propranolol) reducethe amount of oxygen required by the heart during stress.One type of calcium-channel blocker (verapamil, dilti-azem hydrochloride) helps keep the arteries open andreduces blood pressure. Aspirin helps prevent blood
clots from forming on plaques, reducing the likelihood ofa heart attack. Cholesterol-lowering medications are alsoindicated in most cases.

again within six months. The procedure can be repeated.It is less invasive and less expensive than coronary arterybypass surgery.
In coronary artery bypass surgery, a healthy artery or"

It is appropriate forthose patients with blockages in two or three major coro-nary arteries, those with severely narrowed left maincoronary arteries, and those who have not responded toother treatments. It is performed in a hospital under gen-eral anesthesia. A heart-lung machine is used to supportthe patient while the healthy vein or artery is attachedpast the blockage to the coronary artery. About 70% ofpatients who have bypass surgery experience full relieffrom angina; about 20% experience partial relief. Onlyabout 3–4% of patients per year experience a return ofsymptoms.

In many cases, coronary artery disease can be suc-
cessfully treated. Advances in medicine and healthierlifestyles have caused a substantial decline in death ratesfrom coronary artery disease since the mid-1980s.

The “Food Guide” Pyramid developed by the U.S.
Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Ser-vices provides easy-to-follow guidelines for daily heart-healthy eating. It recommends six to 11 servings of bread,cereal, rice, and pasta; three to five servings of vegetables;two to four servings of fruit; two to three servings of milk,yogurt, and cheese; and two to three servings of meat,poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts. Fats, oils, andsweets should be used sparingly. Canola and olive oil arebetter for the heart than other cooking oils. Coronarypatients should be on a strict diet.

"Exercise regularly
Aerobic exercise can lower blood pressure, help con-
trol weight, and increase HDL (“good”) cholesterol. It maykeep the blood vessels more flexible. The Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention and the American College ofSports Medicine recommend moderate to intense aerobicexercise lasting about 30 minutes four or more times perweek for maximum heart health. Three 10-minute exerciseperiods are also beneficial. Aerobic exercise—activitiessuch as walking, jogging, and cycling—uses the large mus-cle groups and forces the body to use oxygen more effi-ciently. It can also include everyday activities such as activegardening, climbing stairs, or brisk housework. People withcoronary artery disease or risk factors should consult a doc-tor before beginning an exercise program.
Maintain a desirable body weight
About one quarter of all Americans are overweight
and nearly one-tenth are obese, according to the SurgeonGeneral’s Report on Nutrition and Health. People who"
"are 20% or more over their ideal body weight have anincreased risk of developing coronary artery disease.Losing weight can help reduce total and LDL choles-terol, reduce triglycerides, and boost HDL cholesterol. Itmay also reduce blood pressure. Eating right and exercis-ing are two key components of losing weight.
Avoid recreational drugs
Do not smoke or use tobacco. Smoking has many
adverse effects on the heart. It increases the heart rate,constricts major arteries, and can create irregular heart-beats. It raises blood pressure, contributes to the develop-ment of plaque, increases the formation of blood clots,and causes blood platelets to cluster and impede bloodflow. Heart damage caused by smoking can be repairedby quitting. Even heavy smokers can return to hearthealth. Several studies have shown that ex-smokers face
the same risk of heart disease as non-smokers within fiveto 10 years after they quit.

"Drink in moderation. Modest consumption of alco-
hol may actually protect against coronary artery diseasebecause alcohol appears to raise levels of HDL (“good”)cholesterol. The American Heart Association definesmoderate consumption as one ounce of alcohol per day,roughly one cocktail, one 8-ounce glass of wine, or two12-ounce glasses of beer. However, even moderate drink-ing can increase risk factors for heart disease for somepeople (by raising blood pressure, for example). Exces-sive drinking is always bad for the heart. It usually raisesblood pressure and can poison the heart and cause abnor-mal heart rhythms or even heart failure.
Do not use other recreational drugs. Commonly used
recreational drugs, particularly cocaine and “crack,” can
seriously harm the heart and should never be used.

Moderate hypertension can be controlled byreducing dietary intake of sodium and fat, exercising reg-ularly, managing stress, abstaining from smoking, anddrinking alcohol in moderation. People for whom thesechanges do not work or people with severe hypertensionmay be helped by many categories of medication.
Manage stress
Everyone experiences stress, the mental and physi-
cal reaction to life’s irritations and challenges. Stress cansometimes be avoided and when it is inevitable, it can becontrolled. Techniques for controlling stress include: tak-ing life more slowly, spending more time with family andfriends, thinking positively, getting enough sleep, exer-cising, and practicing relaxation techniques.

Coronary stenting
Definition
A coronary stent is an artificial support device used
in the coronary artery to keep the vessel open.
Purpose
The coronary stent is a relatively new tool used to
keep coronary arteries expanded, usually following a bal-loon angioplasty . Balloon angioplasty is used in patientswith coronary artery disease . In this disease, the blood"
"vessels on the heart become narrow. When this happens,the oxygen supply is reduced to the heart muscle. Theprimary cause of coronary artery disease is fat depositsblocking the arteries ( atherosclerosis ). In many cases,
balloon angioplasty is unsuccessful and the vessel closesafter the procedure (restenosis). By forming a rigid sup-port, the stent can prevent restenosis and reduce the needfor coronary bypass surgery. The stent is usually a stain-less steel mesh tube. Since the stent will be placed insidean artery, the device comes in various sizes to match thesize of the artery.
Precautions
Any foreign object in the body, like a stent, will
increase the risk of thrombosis. Anticlotting medicationis given to prevent this complication.
Description

"Description
Coronary stenting usually follows balloon angio-
plasty, which requires inserting a balloon catheter intothe femoral artery in the upper thigh. When this catheteris positioned at the location of the blockage in the coro-nary artery, it is slowly inflated to widen that artery, andis then removed. The stent catheter is then threaded intothe artery and the stent is placed around a deflated bal-loon. When this is correctly positioned in the coronaryartery, the balloon is inflated, expanding the stent againstthe walls of the coronary artery. The balloon catheter isremoved, leaving the stent in place to hold the coronaryartery open. A cardiac angiography will follow to insure
that the stent is keeping the artery open.

"Alternative procedures
Balloon angioplasty and coronary stenting are per-
formed to relieve the symptoms of coronary artery disease.By the time coronary artery disease progresses andrequires balloon angioplasty, there is no alternative to bal-loon angioplasty other than coronary bypass surgery.Coronary bypass surgery carries greater risks. However,since coronary artery disease can be related to high fatdiets ,smoking , and lack of exercise , changes in lifestyle
may reduce the risk of developing the disease. Variousmedications for cholesterol, high blood pressure, and dia-betes also can help treat or prevent coronary artery disease.
Preparation
Before the stent is inserted, the patient will probably
be instructed to take aspirin for several days. Aspirin can
help decrease the possibility of blood clots forming at the

"stent. Because anesthesia will be used during the proce-
dure, the patient should not eat or drink after midnight ofthe previous day.
Aftercare
Following the procedure, blood thinners (anticoagu-
lants) will be given through a needle in a vein for about24 hours. The patient should remain flat and still forawhile to allow the femoral artery to heal from the inser-tion of the catheter. Medication to control blood clottingshould be taken after the patient is discharged from thehospital. A special diet may also be recommended that islow in vitamin K and cholesterol. With time, the patientshould begin light exercise, like walking. It is importantthat no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests are
given for six months because the magnetic field maymove the stent.
Risks
Although coronary stents greatly reduce the risk of
restenosis following balloon angioplasty, there is stillsome risk that the stented artery may close. Thrombosis,bleeding, and artery damage are also risks.

Corticosteroids
Definition
Corticosteriods are a group of natural and synthetic
analogues of the hormones secreted by the hypothalamic-anterior pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, more com-monly referred to as the pituitary gland. These includeglucocorticoids, which are anti-inflammatory agents witha large number of other functions; mineralocorticoids,which control salt and water balance primarily throughaction on the kidneys; and corticotropins, which controlsecretion of hormones by the pituitary gland.

"Purpose
Glucocorticoids have multiple effects, and are used
for a large number of conditions. They affect glucose uti-lization, fat metabolism, and bone development, and arepotent anti-inflammatory agents. They may be used forreplacement of natural hormones in patients with pitu-itary deficiency ( Addison’s disease ), as well as for a
wide number of other conditions including, but not limit-ed to, arthritis, asthma , anemia, various cancers, and
skin inflammations. Additional uses include inhibition ofnausea and vomiting after chemotherapy , treatment of
septic shock , treatment of spinal cord injuries, and treat-"
"septic shock , treatment of spinal cord injuries, and treat-
ment of hirisutism (excessive hair growth). The choice ofdrug will vary with the condition. Cortisone and hydro-cortisone, which have both glucocorticoid and mineralo-corticoid effects, are the drugs of choice for replacementtherapy of natural hormone deficiency. Synthetic com-pounds, which have greater anti-inflammatory effectsand less effect on salt and water balance, are usually pre-ferred for other purposes. These compounds include dex-amethasone, which is almost exclusively glucocorticoidin its actions, as well as prednisone, prednisolone,

coids are formulated in oral dosage forms, topical creamsand ointments, oral and nasal inhalations, rectal foams,and ear and eye drops.
Mineralocorticoids control the retention of sodium
in the kidneys. In mineralocorticoid deficiency, there isexcessive loss of sodium through the kidneys, withresulting water loss. Fludrocortisone (Florinef) is theonly drug available for treatment of mineralocorticoiddeficiency, and is available only in an oral dosage form.

"Precautions
Glucocorticoids
The most significant risk associated with administra-
tion of glucocorticoids is suppression of natural corticos-teroid secretion. When the hormones are administered,they suppress the secretion of ACTH, which in turnreduces the secretion of the natural hormones. The extentof suppression varies with dose, drug potency, duration oftreatment, and individual patient response. While suppres-sion is seen primarily with drugs administered systemical-ly, it can also occur with topical drugs such as creams andointments, or drugs administered by inhalation. Abruptcessation of corticosteroids may result in acute adrenal cri-sis (Addisonian crisis) that is marked by dehydration
with severe vomiting and diarrhea ,hypotension , and loss
of consciousness. Acute adrenal crisis is potentially fatal.
Chronic overdose of glucocorticoids leads to Cushin-
goid syndrome, which is clinically identical to Cushing’s
syndrome and differs only in that in Cushingoid, the"
"syndrome and differs only in that in Cushingoid, the
excessive steroids are from drug therapy rather thanexcessive glandular secretion. Symptoms vary, but mostpeople have upper body obesity , rounded face, increased
fat around the neck, and thinning arms and legs. In itslater stages, this condition leads to weakening of bonesand muscles with rib and spinal column fractures .
The short term adverse effects of corticosteroids are
generally mild, and include indigestion , increased
appetite, insomnia , and nervousness. There are also a
very large number of infrequent adverse reactions, themost significant of which is drug induced-paranoia.Delerium, depression, menstrual irregularity, andincreased hair growth are also possible. Consult detailedreviews for further information.
Long-term use of topical glucocorticoids can result
in thinning of the skin. Oral steroid inhalations may cause

"fungal overgrowth in the oral cavity. Patients must be
instructed to rinse their mouths carefully after each dose.Corticosteroids are pregnancy category C. The drugs
have caused congenital malformations in animal studies,including cleft palate. Breastfeeding should be avoided.
Mineralocorticoids
Because fludrocortisone has glucocorticoid activity
as well as mineralocorticoid action, the same hazards andprecautions apply to fludrocortisone as to the glucocorti-coids. Overdose of fludrocortisone may also causeedema ,hypertension, and congestive heart failure .
Corticotropins
Corticotropin has all the same risks as the glucocor-
ticoids. Prolonged use may cause reduced response to thestimulatory effects of corticotropin.
Warnings and contraindications
Use corticosteroids with caution in patients with the

Cortisol tests
Definition
This test is a measure of serum cortisol (also known
as hydrocortisone), or urine cortisol (also known as uri-nary free cortisol), an important hormone produced by apair of endocrine glands called the adrenal glands.
Purpose
This test is performed on patients who may have
malfunctioning adrenal glands. Blood and urine cortisol,together with the determination of adrenocorticotropichormone (ACTH), are the three most important tests inthe investigation of Cushing’s syndrome (caused by an
overproduction of cortisol) and Addison’s disease
(caused by the underproduction of cortisol).
Precautions"
"(caused by the underproduction of cortisol).
Precautions
Increased levels of cortisol are associated with preg-
nancy . Physical and emotional stress can also elevate
cortisol levels. Drugs that may cause increased levels ofcortisol include estrogen, oral contraceptives , ampheta-
mines, cortisone, and spironolactone (Aldactone). Drugsthat may cause decreased levels include androgens,aminoglutethimide, betamethasone, and other steroidmedications, danazol, lithium, levodopa, metyrapone andphenytoin (Dilantin).
Description
Cortisol is a potent hormone known as a glucocorti-
coid that affects the metabolism of carbohydrates, pro-teins, and fats, but especially glucose. Cortisol increasesblood sugar levels by stimulating the release of glucosefrom glucose stores in cells. It also acts to inhibit insulin,thus affecting glucose transport into cells.

itary gland (sometimes called the “master gland”), and"
"itary gland (sometimes called the “master gland”), and

"the adrenal glands coordinate the production of cortisol.
After corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is made inthe hypothalamus, CRH stimulates the pituitary to pro-duce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The produc-tion of ACTH in turn stimulates a part of the adrenalglands known as the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol.Rising levels of cortisol act as a negative feedback to cur-tail further production of CRH and ACTH, thus complet-ing an elaborate feedback mechanism.
There are two methods for evaluating cortisol: blood
and urine. The most reliable index of cortisol secretion isthe 24-hour urine sample collection, but when blood lev-els are required or requested by the physician, plasmacortisol should be measured in the morning and again inthe afternoon. Cortisol levels normally rise and fall dur-ing the day in what is called a diurnal variation, so thatcortisol is at its highest level between 6–8 
A.M. and grad-"
"A.M. and grad-
ually falls, reaching its lowest point around midnight.One reason for ordering blood cortisol levels versus a 24-hour urine collection is that sometimes the earliest signof adrenal malfunction is the loss of this diurnal varia-tion, even though the cortisol levels are not yet elevated.For example, individuals with Cushing’s syndrome oftenhave upper normal plasma cortisol levels in the morningand exhibit no decline as the day progresses.KEY TERMS
Addison’s disease —A rare disorder in which symp-
toms are caused by a deficiency of hydrocortisone(cortisol) and aldosterone, two corticosteroid hor-mones normally produced by a part of the adrenalglands called the adrenal cortex. Symptoms includeweakness, tiredness, vague abdominal pain, weightloss, skin pigmentation and low blood pressure.

called corticotropin, this hormone is produced bythe pituitary gland to stimulate the adrenal cortexto release various corticosteroid hormones.
Cushing’s syndrome —A hormonal disorder caused
by an abnormally high level of corticosteroid hor-mones that are produced by the adrenal glands. Cor-ticosteroid hormones control the body’s use of nutri-ents and the excretion of salts and water in the urine.Symptoms include high blood sugar levels, a moonface, weight gain, and increased blood pressurePreparation
When testing for cortisol levels through the blood, a
blood specimen is usually collected at 8 A.M. and again at
4 P.M. It should be noted that normal values may be trans-
posed in individuals who have worked during the nightand slept during the day for long periods of time.
When testing for cortisol level through the urine, a
24-hour urine sample is collected, refrigerated, and sentto the reference laboratory for examination.
Risks"
"Risks
Risks for the blood test are minimal, but may
include slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site,fainting or feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or
hematoma (blood accumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results
Reference ranges for cortisol vary from laboratory to
laboratory but are usually within the following ranges forblood:
• adults (8 
A.M.): 6–28 mg/dL; adults (4 P.M.): 2–12 mg/dL
• child one to six years (8 A.M.): 3–21 mg/dL; child one
to six years (4 P.M.): 3–10 mg/dL
• newborn: 1/24 mg/dL
Reference ranges for cortisol vary from laboratory to
laboratory, but are usually within the following rangesfor 24-hour urine collection:
• adult: 10–100 mg/24 hours
• adolescent: 5–55 mg/24 hours• child: 2–27 mg/24 hours
Abnormal results
Increased levels of cortisol are found in Cushing’s
syndrome, excess thyroid ( hyperthyroidism ),obesity ,
ACTH-producing tumors, and high levels of stress.
Decreased levels of cortisol are found in Addison’s"
"Decreased levels of cortisol are found in Addison’s
disease, conditions of low thyroid, and hypopituitarism ,
in which pituitary activity is diminished.

"Cosmetic dentistry
Definition
Cosmetic dentistry includes a variety of dental treat-

Purpose
The purpose of cosmetic dentistry is to improve the
appearance of the teeth using bleaching, bonding,veneers, reshaping, orthodontics, or implants.
Description

"Description
Bleaching is done to lighten teeth that are stained
or discolored. It entails the use of a bleaching solutionapplied by a dentist or a gel in a tray that fits over theteeth used at home under a dentist’s supervision. Bond-ing involves applying tooth-colored plastic putty, calledcomposite resin, to the surface of chipped or brokenteeth. This resin is also used to fill cavities in front teeth(giving a more natural-looking result) and to fill gapsbetween teeth. Veneers are thin, porcelain shells thatcover the front of the teeth. They can improve theappearance of damaged, discolored, misshapen, or mis-aligned teeth. Reshaping involves the removal of enam-el from a misshapen tooth so that it matches other teeth.Orthodontics uses braces to correct the position ofcrowded or misaligned teeth. Implants are artificialteeth which are attached directly to the jaw to replacemissing teeth.
Preparation
Bleaching involves having a custom-made bleaching"
"Preparation
Bleaching involves having a custom-made bleaching
tray made by the dentist. This tray is worn at home forseveral hours each day or night. Teeth slowly becomewhite over a period of one to six weeks. Bleaching canalso be done in a dentist’s office. A heat- or light-activatedbleaching solution is applied to six to eight teeth per visit.
Bonding involves etching the surface of the tooth so
composite resin can adhere. The dentist then contours theresin to the right shape, and smooths and polishes theresin after it is hard and dry.
To prepare for the application of a veneer, a thin layer"
"To prepare for the application of a veneer, a thin layer
of enamel is removed from the tooth (so that the finishedtooth will be flush with surrounding teeth) and an impres-sion of the tooth is taken from which the veneer will becreated. Before a veneer is applied, the tooth is etchedwith an acid solution and an adhesive resin is painted onthe tooth. The veneer is then applied, the resin is hardenedwith a bonding light, and the dentist polishes the veneer.KEY TERMS
Bleaching —Technique used to brighten stained
teeth.
Bonding —Rebuilding, reshaping, and covering
tooth defects using tooth-colored materials.
Composite resin —Plastic material matching natur-
al tooth color used to replace missing parts of atooth.
During cosmetic reshaping, some enamel is
removed from the uneven tooth so it more closely match-es other teeth.
Orthodontics involves applying braces to the teeth,"
"Orthodontics involves applying braces to the teeth,
and wires are threaded through the braces. These wiresare adjusted to gradually move the teeth to the desirednew positions. Over time, crowded or misaligned teethare straightened.
Implants are more secure and natural looking than
dentures or bridgework, but are much more expensive.First an anchor for the implant is attached to the jawbone. This surgery can take several hours. About sixmonths later, after the bone around the anchor hashealed, a post is attached to the anchor, and an artificialtooth is attached to the post. The whole process may takeabout nine months to complete.
Aftercare
Periodic touch-up may be needed to keep the teeth"
"Aftercare
Periodic touch-up may be needed to keep the teeth
white if the teeth have been bleached or bonded. Also, theresin used in bonded teeth can be chipped by ice, popcornkernels, or hard candy, requiring repair. Veneered teethmay need to be reveneered after five to 12 years. Onceorthodontic braces are removed, regular visits to theorthodontist are advised because teeth can shift position.Implanted teeth require regular dental checkups to ensurethat the anchor and post are stable.
Risks
After teeth are bleached, they may darken faster if
exposed to staining products such as coffee or tobacco.Some patients experience increased sensitivity to coldwhile teeth are being bleached, but the sensitivity usuallydisappears shortly after completion of the treatment.
Bonded teeth, like bleached teeth, may also stain
more easily than natural teeth. Bonding materials alsochip easily.

"Description
Costochondritis causes pain in the lower rib area or
upper breastbone. Some patients fear they are having aheart attack . The most severe pain is usually between the
breast and the upper abdomen. The pain may be greaterwhen in sitting or reclining positions. Stress may aggra-
vate this condition. Generally the third or fourth ribs areaffected. However, any of the seven costochondral junc-tions may be affected, and more often than not more thanone site is involved. The inflammation can involve carti-lage areas on both sides of the sternum, but usually is onone side only. Costochondritis should be distinguishedfrom Tietze Syndrome, which is an inflammation involv-ing the same area of the chest, but also includes swelling.

"Causes and symptoms
The causes of costochondritis are not well-under-
stood and may be difficult to establish. The most likelycauses include injury, repetitive minor trauma, andunusual excessive physical activity.The primary symptom of costochondritis is severe
chest wall pain, which may vary in intensity. The painbecomes worse with trunk movement, deep breathing,and/or exertion, and better with decreased movement, quietbreathing, or changing of position. It is usually localized butmay radiate extensively from the chest area. The pain hasbeen described as sharp, nagging, aching, or pressure-like.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on pain upon palpation (gentle
pressing) of the affected joints. Swelling is not associatedwith costochondritis. Diagnosis is also dependent on theexclusion of other causes, including heart attack or bac-terial or fungal infections found in IV drug users or post-operative thoracic surgery patients.

"Treatment
The goals of treatment are to reduce inflammation and
to control pain. To accomplish these goals, nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are used, with ibupro-fen usually selected as the drug of choice. Other NSAIDSoptions are flurbiprofen, mefenamic acid, ketoprofen, andnaproxen. Additional treatment recommendations includethe use of local heat, biofeedback , and gentle stretching of
the pectoralis muscles two to three times a day.
For more difficult cases, where the patient continues
to exhibit pain and discomfort, cortisone injections areused as therapy.
Alternative treatment
Supplements that are used to reduce inflammation
have been used to treat costochondritis. Examples ofsuch supplements include ginger root, evening primroseoil, bromelain, vitamin E, omega-3 oils, and white wil-low bark. Glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate, which mayaid in the healing of cartilage, has also been used. Otheralternative therapies include acupuncture and massages.

"months to a year. However, after one year, about one-half
of patients continue with some discomfort, while aboutone-third still report tenderness with palpation.
Prevention
Though the causes of costochondritis are not well
known, avoidance of activities that may strain (e.g., therepetitive misuse of muscles) or cause trauma to the ribcage is recommended to prevent the occurrence of costo-chondritis. Modification of improper posture orergonomics of the home or work place may also deter thedevelopment of this condition.

Cough

"Spinal instrumentation
Cough
Definition
A cough is a forceful release of air from the lungs
that can be heard. Coughing protects the respiratory sys-tem by clearing it of irritants and secretions.
Description
While people can generally cough voluntarily, a
cough is usually a reflex triggered when an irritant stim-ulates one or more of the cough receptors found at dif-ferent points in the respiratory system. These receptorsthen send a message to the cough center in the brain,which in turn tells the body to cough. A cough beginswith a deep breath in, at which point the openingbetween the vocal cords at the upper part of the larynx(glottis) shuts, trapping the air in the lungs. As thediaphragm and other muscles involved in breathingpress against the lungs, the glottis suddenly opens, pro-ducing an explosive outflow of air at speeds greater than100 mi (160 km) per hour.In normal situations, most people cough once or"
"twice an hour during the day to clear the airway of irri-tants. However, when the level of irritants in the air ishigh or when the respiratory system becomes infected,coughing may become frequent and prolonged. It mayinterfere with exercise or sleep, and it may also cause dis-
tress if accompanied by dizziness , chest pain , or breath-
lessness. In the majority cases, frequent coughing lastsone to two weeks and tapers off as the irritant or infectionsubsides. If a cough lasts more than three weeks it is con-sidered a chronic cough, and physicians will try to deter-mine a cause beyond an acute infection or irritant.
Coughs are generally described as either dry or pro-"
"Coughs are generally described as either dry or pro-
ductive. A dry cough does not bring up a mixture ofmucus, irritants, and other substances from the lungs(sputum), while a productive cough does. In the case of abacterial infection, the sputum brought up in a productivecough may be greenish, gray, or brown. In the case of anallergy or viral infection it may be clear or white. In themost serious conditions, the sputum may contain blood.
Causes and symptoms
In the majority of cases, coughs are caused by respi-
ratory infections, including:
• colds or influenza , the most common causes of coughs
•bronchitis , an inflammation of the mucous membranes
of the bronchial tubes
• croup, a viral inflammation of the larynx, windpipe,
and bronchial passages that produces a bark-like coughin children
• whooping cough, a bacterial infection accompanied by
the high-pitched cough for which it is named
•pneumonia , a potentially serious bacterial infection
that produces discolored or bloody mucus"
"•pneumonia , a potentially serious bacterial infection
that produces discolored or bloody mucus
•tuberculosis , another serious bacterial infection that
produces bloody sputum
• fungal infections, such as aspergillosis ,histoplasmo-
sis, and cryptococcoses
Environmental pollutants, such as cigarette smoke,
dust, or smog, can also cause a cough. In the case of cig-arette smokers, the nicotine present in the smoke para-lyzes the hairs (cilia) that regularly flush mucus from therespiratory system. The mucus then builds up, forcingthe body to removed it by coughing. Post-nasal drip, theirritating trickle of mucus from the nasal passages intothe throat caused by allergies or sinusitis , can also result
in a cough. Some chronic conditions, such as asthma ,
chronic bronchitis, emphysema , and cystic fibrosis , are
characterized in part by a cough. A condition in whichstomach acid backs up into the esophagus (gastroe-"

"sophageal reflux) can cause coughing, especially when a
person is lying down. A cough can also be a side-effectof medications that are administered via an inhaler. It canalso be a side-effect of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors,which are drugs used for treating high blood pressure.
Diagnosis
To determine the cause of a cough, a physician
should take an exact medical history and perform anexam. Information regarding the duration of the cough,what other symptoms may accompany it, and what envi-ronmental factors may influence it aid the doctor in his orher diagnosis. The appearance of the sputum will alsohelp determine what type of infection, if any, may beinvolved. The doctor may even observe the sputummicroscopically for the presence of bacteria and whiteblood cells. Chest x rays may help indicate the presenceand extent of such infections as pneumonia or tuberculo-sis. If these actions are not enough to determine the causeof the cough, a bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy may be"
"ordered. These tests use slender tubular instruments toinspect the interior of the bronchi and larynx.
Treatment
Treatment of a cough generally involves addressing
the condition causing it. An acute infection such as pneu-monia may require antibiotics , an asthma-induced
cough may be treated with the use of bronchodialators,or an antihistamine may be administered in the case of anallergy. Physicians prefer not to suppress a productivecough, since it aids the body in clearing respiratory sys-tem of infective agents and irritants. However, coughKEY TERMS

cough up by thinning it. Guaifenesin and terpin hydrateare the primary ingredients in most over-the-counterexpectorants. However, some studies have shown that inacute infections, simply increasing fluid intake has thesame thinning effect as taking expectorants.
Alternative treatment
Coughs due to bacterial or viral upper respiratory
infections may be effectively treated with botanical andhomeopathic therapies. The choice of remedy will varyand be specific to the type of cough the patient has. Somecombination over-the-counter herbal and homeopathiccough formulas can be very effective for cough relief.Lingering coughs or coughing up blood should be treatedby a trained practitioner.

"Many health practitioners advise increasing fluids
and breathing in warm, humidified air as ways of loosen-ing chest congestion. Others recommend hot tea flavoredwith honey as a temporary home remedy for coughscaused by colds or flu. Various vitamins , such as vitamin
C, may be helpful in preventing or treating conditions(including colds and flu) that lead to coughs. Avoiding ofmucous-producing foods can be effective in healing acough condition. These mucous-producing foods canvary, based on individual intolerance, but dairy productsare a major mucous-producing food for most people.
Prognosis
Because the majority of coughs are related to the
common cold or influenza, most will end in seven to 21
days. The outcome of coughs due to a more serious under-lying disease depends on the pathology of that disease.

"Prevention
It is important to identify and treat the underlying
disease and origin of the cough. Avoid smoking and
coming in direct contact with people experiencing coldor flu symptoms. Wash hands frequently during episodesof upper-respiratory illnesses.

Purpose
Cough suppressants act on the center in the brain
that controls the cough reflex. They are meant to be usedonly to relieve dry, hacking coughs associated with coldsand flu. They should not be used to treat coughs thatbring up mucus or the chronic coughs associated withsmoking ,asthma ,emphysema or other lung problems.
Many cough medicines contain cough suppressants
along with other ingredients. Some combinations ofingredients may cancel each other’s effects. One exampleis the combination of cough suppressant with an expecto-rant—a medicine that loosens and clears mucus from theairways. The cough suppressant interferes with the abilityto cough up the mucus that the expectorant loosens.

Craniosacral therapy
Definition
Craniosacral therapy is a holistic healing practice
that uses very light touching to balance the craniosacralsystem in the body, which includes the bones, nerves, flu-ids, and connective tissues of the cranium and spinal area.
Purpose
According to Upledger, craniosacral therapy is ide-
ally suited for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), headaches, chronic middle ear infection, pain ,
and general health maintenance. It is recommended forautism ,fibromyalgia , heart disease, osteoarthritis ,
pneumonia ,rheumatoid arthritis , chronic sinus infec-
tions, and gastroenteritis (inflammation of the lining of
the stomach or small intestine). It is also used with othertherapies to treat chronic fatigue syndrome , back pain,"
"and menstrual irregularity. In addition, other craniosacralpractitioners have reported benefits for eye dysfunction,dyslexia , depression, motor coordination difficulties,
temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD), hyperac-tivity, colic ,asthma in babies, floppy baby syndrome,
whiplash ,cerebral palsy , certain birth defects , and
other central nervous system disorders.
Description
Origins
The first written reference to the movement of the
spinal nerves and its importance in life, clarity, and“bringing quiet to the heart” is found in a 4,000-year-oldtext from China. Craniosacral work was referred to as“the art of listening.” Bone setters in the Middle Agesalso sensed the subtle movements of the body. They usedthese movements to help reset fractures and dislocations
and to treat headaches.

"In the early 1900s, the research of Dr. William
Sutherland, an American osteopathic physician, detailedthe movement of the cranium and pelvis. Before hisresearch it was believed that the cranium was a solidimmovable mass. Sutherland reported that the skull isactually made up of 22 separate and movable bones thatare connected by layers of tissue. He called his work cra-nial osteopathy . Nephi Cotton, an American chiroprac-
tor and contemporary of Sutherland, called this approachcraniology. The graduates of these two disciplines haverefined and enhanced these original approaches andrenamed their work as sacro-occipital technique, cranialmovement therapy , or craniosacral therapy.
Dr. John Upledger, an osteopathic physician, and"
"Dr. John Upledger, an osteopathic physician, and
others at the Department of Biomechanics at MichiganState University, College of Osteopathic Medicinelearned of Sutherland’s research and developed it further.He researched the clinical observations of various osteo-pathic physicians. This research provided the basis forUpledger’s work that he named craniosacral therapy.
Craniosacral therapy addresses the craniosacral sys-
tem. This system includes the cranium, spine, andsacrum that are connected by a continuous membrane ofconnective tissue deep inside the body, called the duramater. The dura mater also encloses the brain and thecentral nervous system. Sutherland noticed that cerebralspinal fluid rises and falls within the compartment of thedura mata. He called this movement the primary respira-tory impulse; today it is known as the craniosacralrhythm (CSR) or the cranial wave.
Craniosacral therapists can most easily feel the CSR"
"Craniosacral therapists can most easily feel the CSR
in the body by lightly touching the base of the skull orthe sacrum. During a session, they feel for disturbancesin the rate, amplitude, symmetry, and quality of flow ofthe CSR. A therapist uses very gentle touch to balancethe flow of the CSR. Once the cerebrospinal fluid movesfreely, the body’s natural healing responses can function.
A craniosacral session generally lasts 30–90 min-
utes. The client remains fully clothed and lays down on amassage table while the therapist gently assesses theflow of the CSR. Upledger describes several techniqueswhich may be used in a craniosacral therapy session. Thefirst is energy cyst release. “This technique is a hands-onmethod of releasing foreign or disruptive energies fromthe patient’s body. Energy cysts may cause the disruptionof the tissues and organs were they are located.” Thetherapist feels these cysts in the client’s body and gentlyreleases the blockage of energy."
"Sutherland first wrote about a second practice called
direction of energy. In this technique the therapist intendsenergy to pass from one of his hands, through the patient,into the other hand.WILLIAM SUTHERLAND
(1873–1954)
William Garner Sutherland studied osteopathy
under its founder, Andrew Taylor Still. Dr. Sutherlandmade his own important discovery while examining thesutures of cranial bones the skull bones that protect thebrain. What he noticed is that the sutures were designedfor motion. Sutherland termed this motion the Breath of
Life. Through his experiments and research he deter-
mined that primary respiration was essential to all otherphysiological functions.
When Sutherland developed his techniques for"
"When Sutherland developed his techniques for
craniosacral therapy, he wanted it to serve as a vehiclefor listening to the body’s rhythmic motions and treat thepatterns of inertia when those motions become congest-ed. He believed that the stresses—any physical or emo-tional trauma—created an imbalance in the body thatneeded correction to restore it to full health. The therapyis a hands-on method so that the therapist can feel thesubtleties of the patterns of movement and inertia.Sutherland felt that this was the way to encourage self-healing and restoration of the body’s own mechanisms,taking a holistic approach to creating optimal health.
The Craniosacral Therapy Educational Trust, based
on Sutherland’s pioneering work, is located at 10 Norm-ington Close, Leigham Court Road, London SW16 2QS,United Kingdom. The phone number is 07000 785778.
The third technique is called myofascial release."
"The third technique is called myofascial release.
This is a manipulative form of bodywork that releasestension in the fascia or connective tissue of the body.This form of bodywork uses stronger touch.
Upledger’s fourth technique is position of release.
This involves following the client’s body into the posi-tions in which an injury occurred and holding it there.When the rhythm of the CSR suddenly stops the therapistknows that the trauma has been released.
The last technique is somatoemotional release. This
technique was developed by Upledger and is an offshootof craniosacral therapy. It is used to release the mind andbody of the residual effects of trauma and injury that are“locked in the tissues.”
The cost of a session varies due to the length of time
needed and the qualifications of the therapist. The costmay be covered by insurance when the therapy is per-formed or prescribed by a licensed health care provider.

"Research and general acceptance
More than 40 scientific papers have been published
that document the various effects of craniosacral therapy.There are also 10 authoritative textbooks on this therapy.The most notable scientific papers include Viola M. Fry-man’s work documenting the successful treatment of1,250 newborn children with birth defects. Edna Lay andStephen Blood showed the effects on TMD, and JohnWood documented results with psychiatric disorders.The American Dental Association has found craniosacraltherapy to be an effective adjunct to orthodontic work.However, the conventional medical community has notendorsed these techniques.

Precautions
Before the operation, the patient will have undergone
diagnostic procedures such as computed tomography
scans (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
to determine the underlying problem that required thecraniotomy and to get a better look at the brain’s structure.Cerebral angiography may be used to study the blood
supply to the tumor, aneurysm, or other brain lesion.
Description
There are two basic ways to open the skull:
• a curving incision from behind the hairline, in front of
the ear, arching above the eye
• at the nape of the neck around the occipital lobe
The surgeon marks with a felt tip pen a large square"
"The surgeon marks with a felt tip pen a large square
flap on the scalp that covers the surgical area. Followingthis mark, the surgeon makes an incision into the skin asfar as the thin membrane covering the skull bone.Because the scalp is well supplied with blood, the sur-geon will have to seal many small arteries. The surgeonthen folds back a skin flap to expose the bone.
Using a high speed hand drill or an automatic cran-
iotome, the surgeon makes a circle of holes in the skull,and pushes a soft metal guide under the bone from onehole to the next. A fine wire saw is then moved along theguide channel under the bone between adjacent holes.The surgeon saws through the bone until the bone flapcan be removed to expose the brain.
After the surgery for the underlying cause is com-
pleted, the piece of skull is replaced and secured withpieces of fine, soft wire. Finally, the surgeon sutures themembrane, muscle, and skin of the scalp.

"of swelling, seizures, and infection after the operation.
Fluids may be restricted, and a diuretic may be givenbefore and during surgery if the patient has a tendency toretain water. A catheter is inserted before the patient goesto the operating room.
The scalp is shaved in the operating room right
before surgery; this is done so that any small nicks in theskin won’t have a chance to become infected before theoperation.
Aftercare
Oxygen, painkillers, and drugs to control swelling
and seizures are given after the operation. Codeine maybe given to relieve the headache that may occur as a
result of stretching or irritation of the nerves of the scalpthat happens during the craniotomy. Some type ofdrainage from the head may be in place, depending onthe reason for the surgery.
Patients are usually out of bed within a day and out
of the hospital within a week. Headache and pain from
the scalp wound can be controlled with medications.

"The bandage on the skull should be changed regular-
ly. Sutures closing the scalp will be removed, but softwires used to reattach the skull are permanent and
require no further attention. The patient should avoid get-ting the scalp wet until all the sutures have beenremoved. A clean cap or scarf can be worn until the hairgrows back.
Risks
Accessing the area of the brain that needs repair may
damage other brain tissue. Therefore, the procedure car-ries with it some risk of brain damage that could leavethe patient with some loss of brain function. The surgeonperforming the operation can give the patient an assess-ment of the risk of his or her particular procedure.
Normal results
While every patient’s experience is different depend-
ing on the reason for the surgery, age, and overall health,if the surgery has been successful, recovery is usuallyrapid because of the good supply of blood to the area.

Creatine kinase test
Definition
The creatine kinase test measures the blood levels of
certain muscle and brain enzyme proteins.
Purpose
Creatine kinase (CK or CPK) is an enzyme (a type
of protein) found in muscle and brain. Normally, very lit-tle CK is found circulating in the blood. Elevated levelsindicate damage to either muscle or brain; possibly froma myocardial infarction ( heart attack ), muscle disease,
or stroke .
There are three types, or isoforms, of CK:
• CK-I, or BB, is produced primarily by brain and
smooth muscle."
"• CK-I, or BB, is produced primarily by brain and
smooth muscle.
• CK-II, or MB, is produced primarily by heart muscle.• CK-III, or MM, is produced primarily by skeletal muscle.
Precautions
No special precautions are necessary, except in
patients with a bleeding disorder.KEY TERMS
Craniotome —A type of surgical drill used to oper-
ate on the skull. It has a self-controlled system thatstops the drill when the bone is penetrated.Description
A small amount of blood is drawn and used for labo-
ratory analysis.
Preparation
Physical activity may cause a rise in CK levels,
especially the CK-III fraction. Therefore, patients shouldnot engage in strenuous physical activity the day of thetest. The patient should report any recent injections, falls,or bruises that have occurred, as these may elevate CK
levels as well.
Aftercare
No aftercare is required, except to keep the puncture
site clean while it heals.
Risks
There are no risks to this test beyond the very slight"
"site clean while it heals.
Risks
There are no risks to this test beyond the very slight
risk of infection at the puncture site.
Normal results
In females, total CK should be 10–79 units per liter
(U/L). In males, total CK should be 17–148 U/L. CK lev-els are reduced in the first half of pregnancy , and
increased in the second half. CK levels are elevated innewborns.
The distribution of isoenzymes should be:
• CK-I: 0%• CK-II: 0–5%
• CK-III: 95–100%
Abnormal results
Elevation of CK-I may be seen in stroke, extreme
shock , or brain tumor .
Elevation of CK-II is seen after a myocardial infarc-
tion. It begins to rise three to six hours after the heartattack, and may peak within 24 hours. It should thenreturn to normal. For this reason, it is a useful marker forrecent myocardial infarction, but not for one whichoccurred more than a day before the test.
Elevation of CK-III indicates skeletal muscle dam-
age. This may occur from normal exercise , trauma, or"
"age. This may occur from normal exercise , trauma, or
muscle disease. CK levels may be very high early on inmuscular dystrophy , but may fall to normal later as
muscle tissue is lost. Elevated CK is also seen in myosi-tis, myoglobinuria, toxoplasmosis , and trichinosis .
Hypothyroidism may also cause elevated CK.

Creatinine test
Definition
Creatine is an important compound produced by the
body. It combines with phosphorus to make a high-energy phosphate compound in the body. Creatine phos-phate is used in skeletal muscle contraction.
Purpose
The creatinine test is used to diagnose impaired kid-
ney function and to determine renal (kidney) damage.
Precautions
A diet high in meat content can cause transient ele-
vations of serum creatinine. Some drugs that mayincrease creatinine values include gentamicin, cimeti-dine, heavy-metal chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cis-platin), and other drugs toxic to the kidneys, such as thecephalosporins .

Smooth muscles —Muscles that surround the lin-

tine, and the following product, creatinine, depends onmuscle mass, which fluctuates very little.
Creatinine is excreted entirely by the kidneys, and
therefore is directly related to renal function. When thekidneys are functioning normally, the serum creatininelevel should remain constant and normal. Slight increas-es in creatine levels can appear after meals, especiallyafter ingestion of large quantities of meat, and some diur-nal variation may occur, with a low point at 7 
A.M. and a"
"A.M. and a
peak at 7 P.M. Serious renal disorders, such as glomeru-
lonephritis ,pyelonephritis , and urinary obstruction,
will cause abnormal elevations.
The creatinine level is interpreted in conjunction
with another kidney function test called the Blood UreaNitrogen (BUN). The serum creatinine level has muchthe same significance as the BUN but tends to rise later.Because of this, determinations of creatinine help tochronicle a disease process. Generally, a doubling of cre-atinine suggests a 50% reduction in kidney filtration rate.
Preparation
The creatinine test requires a blood sample. It is rec-
ommended that the patient be fasting (nothing to eat or
drink) for at least eight hours before the test. The physi-cian may also require that ascorbic acid (vitamin C),barbiturates , and diuretics be withheld for 24 hours.
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or"
"slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or
feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results
Normal values can vary from laboratory to laborato-
ry, but are generally in the following ranges:
• Adult female: 0.5–1.1 mg/dL
• Adult male: 0.6–1.2 mg/dL
• Adolescent: 0.5–1.0 mg/dL
• Child: 0.3–0.7 mg/dL
• Infant: 0.2–0.4 mg/dL• Newborn: 0.3–1.2 mg/dL
Note that variations between sources for serum crea-
tinine normal ranges are greater than for other importanttests. For example, due to the greater amount of musclemass generally present, males normally demonstratehigher creatinine levels than females. Also, because thekidney filtration rate normally increases in pregnancy ,
serum creatinine should be slightly less during such peri-

"ods. In older patients, creatinine is reduced because of
decreased muscle mass. Similarly, other patients mayhave creatinine levels in which muscle abnormalitiesmust be taken into consideration, such as long-term cor-ticosteroid therapy, high thyroid ( hyperthyroidism ),
muscular dystrophy , or paralysis .
Abnormal results
Two to 4 mg/dL indicate the presence of impairment
of renal function. Greater than 4 mg/dL indicates seriousimpairment in renal function.

Additionally, the radical theory that the infectiousagent is a normal protein that has been changed in itsform has also sparked much interest.
First described in the first part of the twentieth cen-
tury independently by Cretzfeldt and Jakob, CJD is aneurodegenerative disease causing a rapidly progressingdementia ending in death , usually within eight months"
"of the onset of symptoms. It is also a very rare disease,affecting only about one in every million in the popula-tion through out the world. In the United States, CJD isthought to affect about 250 people each year. CJD affectsadults primarily between ages 50 and 75.
Spongiform encephalopathies
The most obvious pathologic feature of CJD is the
formation of numerous fluid-filled spaces in the brain(vacuoles) resulting in a sponge-like appearance. CJD isone of several human “spongiform encephalopathies,”diseases that produce this characteristic change in braintissue. Others are kuru; Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinkerdisease, a genetic predominantly characterized by cere-bellar ataxia (a kind of movement disorder); and fatalfamilial insomnia , associated with progressive insomnia,
autonomic system disfunction, and weakness caused bymotor system dysfunction.
Kuru was prevalent among the Fore people in Papua,"
"Kuru was prevalent among the Fore people in Papua,
New Guinea, and spread from infected individuals aftertheir deaths through the practice of ritual cannibalism, inwhich the relatives of the dead person honored him byconsuming his organs, including the brain. Discovery ofthe infectious nature of kuru won the Nobel Prize forCarleton Gadjusek in 1976. The incubation period forkuru was between four to 30 years or more. While kuruhas virtually disappeared following the cessation of thesecannibalistic practices, several new cases continue toarise each year.
Cases of CJD have been grouped into three types:
familial, iatrogenic, and sporadic.

"• Familial CJD, representing 5–15% of cases, is inherited
in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that eitherparent may pass along the disease to a child, who maythen develop CJD later in life.
• Iatrogenic CJD occurs when a person is infected during
a medical procedure, such as organ donation, bloodtransfusion , or brain surgery. The rise in organ dona-"
"tion has increased this route of transmission; grafts ofinfected corneas and dura mater (the tissue covering thebrain) have been shown to transmit CJD. Anothersource is hormones concentrated from the pituitaryglands of cadavers, some of whom carried CJD, for usein people with growth hormone deficiencies. Iatrogenicinfection from exposure to nerve-containing tissue rep-resents a small fraction of all cases. The incubationperiod between exposure to the infectious agent is verylong and is estimated to be from less than 10 to morethan 30 years. It remains unlikely, but not impossible,that blood from patients with CJD is infectious to oth-ers by transfusion.
• Sporadic CJD represents at least 85% of all cases. Spo-
radic cases have no identifiable source of infection. Deathusually follows first symptoms within eight months.

"Animal forms and “mad cow disease”
Six forms of spongiform encephalopathies are
known to occur in other mammals: scrapie in sheep, rec-ognized for more than 200 years; chronic wasting diseasein elk and mule deer in Wyoming and Colorado; trans-missible mink encephalopathy; exotic ungulateencephalopathy in some types of zoo animals; felinespongiform encephalopathy in domestic cats; and bovinespongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cows.
BSE was first recognized in Britain in 1986. Besides
the spongiform changes in the brain, BSE causes demen-tia-like behavioral changes—hence the name “mad cowdisease.” BSE was thought to be an altered form ofscrapie, transmitted to cows when they were fed sheepoffal (slaughterhouse waste) as part of their feed, but it isnow thought to be more likely to be a primary cattle dis-ease spread by contaminated feed.

"The use of slaughterhouse offal in animal feed has
been common in many countries and has been practicedfor at least 50 years. The trigger for the BSE epidemic inGreat Britain seems to have come in the early 1980s,when the use of organic solvents for preparation of offalwas altered there. It is possible that these solvents hadbeen destroying the agent called a prion, thereby prevent-ing infection, and that the change in preparation proce-dure opened the way for the agent to “jump species” andcause BSE in cows that consumed scrapie-infected meal.The slaughter of infected (but not yet visibly sick) cowsat the end of their useful farm lives, and the use of their"
"carcasses for feed, spread the infection rapidly and wide-ly. For at least a year after BSE was first recognized inBritish herds, infected bovine remains continued to beincorporated into feed, spreading the disease still further.Although milk from infected cows has never been shownto pass the infectious agent, passage from infected moth-er to calf may have occurred through unknown means.
Beginning in 1988, the British government took
steps to stop the spread of BSE, banning the use ofbovine offal in feed and other products and ordering theslaughter of infected cows. By then, the slow-actingagent had become epidemic in British herds. In 1992, itwas diagnosed in over 25,000 animals (1% of theBritish herd). By mid-1997, the cumulative number ofBSE cases in the United Kingdom had risen to morethan 170,000. The feeding ban did stem the tide of theepidemic; however, the number of new cases each weekfell from a peak of 1,000 in 1993 to less than 300 twoyears later."
"The export of British feed and beef to member coun-
tries was banned by the European Union, but cases ofBSE had developed in Europe by then as well; however,by mid-1997, only about 1,000 cases had been identified.In 1989, the United States banned import of British beefand began monitoring United States herds in 1990. Todate, no BSE has been detected in the United States, andonly one case has been reported in North America in acow imported to Canada from Great Britain.

From the beginning of the BSE epidemic, scientists
and others in Britain feared that BSE might jump speciesagain to infect humans who had consumed infected beef.This, however, had never occurred in scrapie from sheep,a disease known from hundreds of years. In 1996, thefirst report of this possibility occurred and this fearseemed to be realized with the first cases of a new variantof Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, termed nvCJD, now justvCJD. Its victims are much younger than the 60–65 yearold average for CJD, and the time from symptom onset todeath has averaged 12 months or more instead of eight.The disease appears to cause more psychiatric symptomsearly on. EEG abnormalities characteristic of CJD arenot typically seen in vCJD.

"Evidence is growing stronger that vCJD is in fact
caused by BSE:
• almost all of the cases so far have occurred in Great
Britain, the location of the BSE epidemic.

similar to vCJD
• BSE and vCJD produce the same brain lesions after the

"Assuming that BSE is the source, the question that
has loomed from the beginning has been is how manypeople will eventually be affected. Epidemiologicalmodels of infectious disease produce estimates rangingfrom less than one hundred (a level already broken) totens of thousands or more, depending on the assumptionsused by the modelers. The incubation period of vCJD inhumans is not known, nor are the genetic and environ-mental risk factors that influence susceptibility, nor thequantity of infectious agent needed to cause the disease.It is estimated that between one and two million infectedcattle have been eaten by humans, most in the earlieststages of the epidemic. Estimates cannot be based on thevery few cases that have developed so far. These casescould represent the very few people with the right combi-nation of exposure and susceptibility to a relatively fast-developing infection, or they could be the first few vic-tims of a slower-acting, more highly infectious agent."
"Causes and symptoms
Causes
It is clear that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is caused by
an infectious agent, but it is not yet clear what type ofagent that is. Originally assumed to be a virus, evidenceis accumulating that, instead, CJD is caused by a proteincalled a prion (PREE-on, for “proteinaceous infectiousparticle”) transmitted from victim to victim. The otherspongiform encephalopathies are also hypothesized to bedue to prion infection.
If this hypothesis is proved true, it would represent
one of the most radical new ideas in biology since thediscovery of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). All infec-tious diseases, in fact all life, uses nucleic acids—DNAor ribonucleic acid (RNA)—to code the instructionsneeded for reproduction. Inactivation of the nucleic acidsdestroys the capacity to reproduce. However, when these"
"same measures are applied to infected tissue fromspongiform encephalopathy victims, infectivity is notdestroyed. Furthermore, purification of infected tissue toconcentrate the infectious fraction yields protein, notnucleic acid. While it remains possible that some highlystable nucleic acid remains hidden within the purifiedprotein, this is seemingly less and less likely as furtherexperiments are done. The “prion hypothesis,” as it iscalled, is now widely accepted, at least provisionally, bymost researchers in the field. The most vocal proponentof the hypothesis, Stanley Prusiner, was awarded theNobel Prize in 1997 for his work in the prion diseases.
A prion is an altered form of a normal brain protein."
"A prion is an altered form of a normal brain protein.
The normal protein has a helical shape along part of itslength. In the prion form, a sheet structure replaces thehelix. According to the hypothesis, when the normalform interacts with the prion form, some of its helicalpart is converted to a sheet, thus creating a new prioncapable of transforming other normal forms. In this way,the disease process resembles crystallization more thantypical viral infection, in which the virus commands thehost’s cellular machinery to reproduce more of the virus.Build-up of the sheet form causes accumulation ofabnormal protein clumps and degeneration of brain cells,which is thought to cause the disease.
The brain protein affected by the prion, called PrP, is"
"part of the membrane of brain cells, but its exact functionis unknown. It is composed of about 250 subunits, calledamino acids, coded for by a gene on chromosome 20.Slight genetic differences, called polymorphisms, giverise to two slightly different normal protein forms: sub-unit 129 is a “methionine” in one form, but is “valine” inthe other. A person may have all of one, all of the other,or a mixture of the two, depending on their genetic inher-itance. Both forms have the normal helical structure, andfunction normally. However, susceptibility to prion con-version is influenced by subunit 129: a person with amixture of forms is more resistant to conversion. All thecases of vCJD tested have had just methionine at 129.Exposure to the infectious agent is, of course, stillrequired for disease development. Prion diseases are notcontagious in the usual sense, and transmission from aninfected person to another person requires direct inocula-tion of infectious material."
"Familial CJD, on the other hand, does not require
exposure, but develops through the inheritance of other,more disruptive mutations in the gene for the normal PrPprotein. Researchers believe these mutations increase thelikelihood that the protein may more spontaneously“flip” to the sheet form; once created, these can then con-vert other normal-form molecules. The other two inherit-ed human prion diseases, Gerstmann-Straussler-

"Scheinker disease and fatal familial insomnia, involve
different mutations in the same gene.
The large majority of CJD cases are sporadic, mean-
ing they have no known route of infection or genetic link.Causes of sporadic CJD are likely to be diverse and mayinclude spontaneous genetic mutation, spontaneous pro-tein changes, or unrecognized exposure to infectiousagents. It is highly likely that future research will identi-fy more risk factors associated with sporadic CJD.

"Symptoms
About one in four people with CJD begin their ill-
ness with weakness, changes in sleep patterns, weightloss, or loss of appetite or sexual drive. A person withCJD may first complain of visual disturbances, includingdouble vision, blurry vision, or partial loss of vision.Some visual symptoms are secondary to cortical blind-ness related to death of nerve cells in the occipital lobe ofthe brain responsible for vision. This form of visual lossis unusual in that patients may be unaware that they areunable to see. These symptoms may appear weeks tomonths before the onset of dementia.
The most characteristic symptom of CJD is rapidly
progressing dementia, or loss of mental function.Dementia is marked by:
• memory losses• impaired abstraction and planning• language and comprehension disturbances
• poor judgment
• disorientation• decreased attention and increased restlessness• personality changes and psychosis• hallucinations

"Muscle spasms and jerking movements, called
myoclonus, are also a prominent symptom of CJD. Bal-ance and coordination disturbance (ataxia), is common inCJD, and is more pronounced in nvCJD. Stiffness, diffi-culty moving, and other features representing Parkinson’s
disease are seen and can progress to akinetic mutism ,
which is a state of being unable to speak or move.
Diagnosis
CJD is diagnosed by a clinical neurological exam
and electroencephalography (EEG), which shows char-
acteristic spikes called triphasic sharp waves. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography
scans (CT) should be done to exclude other forms of
dementia, and in CJD typically shows atrophy or loss ofbrain tissue. Lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, may bedone to rule out other causes of dementia (as cell count,"
"chemical analysis, and other routine tests are normal inCJD) and to identify elevated levels of marker proteinsknown as 14-3-3. Another marker, neuron-specific eno-lase, may also be increased in CJD. CJD is conclusivelydiagnosed after death by brain autopsy . Scientists are
investigating whether testing lymphatic tissue such as thetonsil may be an early tool in vCJD diagnosis. Addition-ally, recent studies have suggested that other blood testsmay be useful as well.

"Treatment
There is no cure for CJD, and no treatment that
slows the progression of the disease. Drug therapy andnursing care are aimed at minimizing psychiatric symp-toms and increasing patient comfort. However, the rapidprogression of CJD frustrates most attempts at treatment,since decreasing cognitive function and more prominentbehavioral symptoms develop so quickly. Despite thegenerally grim prognosis, a few CJD patients progressmore slowly and live longer than the average; for thesepatients, treatment will be more satisfactory. Scientistsare investigating whether some medicines that can“break” the abnormal protein form may be useful andwhether a vaccine could help.
Prognosis
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is invariably fatal, with
death following symptom onset by an average of eightmonths. About 5% of patients live longer than two years.Death from vCJD has averaged approximately 12months after onset.

"Prevention
There is no known way to prevent sporadic CJD, by
far the most common type. Not everyone who inheritsthe gene mutation for familial CJD will develop the dis-ease, but at present, there is no known way to predictwho will and who won’t succumb. The incidence ofiatrogenic CJD has fallen with recognition of its sources,the development of better screening techniques forinfected tissue, and the use of sterilization techniques forsurgical instruments that inactivate prion proteins.

Description
Dr. Jerome Lejeune first described cri du chat syn-
drome in 1963. The syndrome is named for the cat-likecry made by infants with this genetic disorder. Cri du
chat means “cry of the cat” in French. This unusual cry is
caused by abnormal development of the larynx (organ inthe throat responsible for voice production). Cri du chatsyndrome is also called “5p minus syndrome” because itis caused by a deletion, or removal, of genetic materialfrom chromosome 5. The deletion that causes cri du chatsyndrome occurs on the short or “p” arm of chromosome5. This deleted genetic material is vital for normal devel-opment. Absence of this material results in the featuresassociated with cri du chat syndrome.

"A high-pitched mewing cry during infancy is a classic
feature of cri du chat. Infants with cri du chat also typicallyhave low birth weight, slow growth, a small head (micro-cephaly) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Infants with cridu chat may have congenital heart defects. Individuals withcri du chat syndrome have language difficulties, delayedmotor skill development, and mental retardation. Behav-ioral problems may also develop as the child matures.
It has been estimated that cri du chat syndrome
occurs in one of every 50,000 live births. According tothe 5p minus Society, approximately 50–60 children areborn with cri du chat syndrome in the United States eachyear. It can occur in all races and in both sexes.

"Causes and symptoms
Cri du chat is the result of a chromosome abnormali-

If a child has cri du chat dueto a sporadic deletion, the chance the parents could haveanother child with cri du chat is 1%. In approximately10% of patients with cri du chat, there is a hereditarychromosomal rearrangement that causes the deletion. If aparent has this rearrangement, the risk for them to have achild with cri du chat is greater than 1%.

Chromosome analysis, alsocalled “karyotyping,” involves staining the chromosomesand examining them under a microscope. In some casesthe deletion of material from chromosome 5 can be easi-ly seen. In other cases, further testing must be performed.FISH (fluorescence in-situ hybridization) is a specialtechnique that detects very small deletions.

"Description
Crohn’s disease involves inflammation of the intes-
tine, especially the small intestine. Inflammation refersto swelling, redness, and loss of normal function. Thereis evidence that the inflammation is caused by variousproducts of the immune system that attack the body itselfinstead of helpfully attacking a foreign invader (a virusor bacteria, for example). The inflammation of Crohn’sdisease most commonly affects the last part of the ileum(a section of the small intestine), and often includes thelarge intestine (the colon). However, inflammation mayalso occur in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract,affecting the mouth, esophagus, or stomach. Crohn’s dis-ease differs from ulcerative colitis , the other major type
of IBD, in two important ways:

"of IBD, in two important ways:
• The inflammation of Crohn’s disease may be discontin-
uous, meaning that areas of involvement in the intestinemay be separated by normal, unaffected segments ofintestine. The affected areas are called “regional enteri-tis,” while the normal areas are called “skip areas.”
• The inflammation of Crohn’s disease affects all the lay-
ers of the intestinal wall, while ulcerative colitis affectsonly the lining of the intestine.
Also, ulcerative colitis does not usually involve the
small intestine; in rare cases it involves the terminalileum (so-called “backwash” ileitis).
In addition to inflammation, Crohn’s disease causes
ulcerations, or irritated pits in the intestinal wall. Thesepits occur because the inflammation has made areas oftissue shed.
Crohn’s disease may be diagnosed at any age,"
"Crohn’s disease may be diagnosed at any age,
although most diagnoses are made between the ages of15–35. About 0.02–0.04% of the population suffers fromthis disorder, with men and women having an equalchance of being stricken. Whites are more frequentlyaffected than other racial groups, and people of Jewish ori-gin are between three and six times more likely to sufferfrom IBD. IBD runs in families; an IBD patient has a 20%chance of having other relatives who are fellow sufferers.
Crohn’s disease is a chronic disorder. While the
symptoms can be improved, a patient will not be com-pletely cured of the underlying disease.

"Causes and symptoms
The cause of Crohn’s disease is unknown. No infec-
tious agent (virus, bacteria, or fungi) has been identifiedas the cause of Crohn’s disease. Still, some researchershave theorized that some type of infection may haveoriginally been responsible for triggering the immunesystem, resulting in the continuing and out-of-controlcycle of inflammation that occurs in Crohn’s disease.Other evidence for a disorder of the immune systemincludes the high incidence of other immune disordersthat may occur along with Crohn’s disease.
The first symptoms of Crohn’s disease include diar-

have signs of malnutrition , depending on the amount of
intestine affected and the duration of the disease.
The combination of severe inflammation, ulceration,
and scarring that occurs in Crohn’s disease can result inserious complications, including obstruction, abscess
formation, and fistula formation.
An obstruction is a blockage in the intestine. This
obstruction prevents the intestinal contents from passingbeyond the point of the blockage. The intestinal contents“back up,” resulting in constipation , vomiting, and"
"intense pain. Although rare in Crohn’s disease (becauseof the increased thickness of the intestinal wall due toswelling and scarring), a severe bowel obstruction canresult in an intestinal wall perforation (a hole in the intes-tine). Such a hole in the intestinal wall would allow theintestinal contents, usually containing bacteria, to enterthe abdomen. This complication could result in a severe,life-threatening infection.
Abcess formation is the development of a walled-off
pocket of infection. A patient with an abscess will havebouts of fever, increased abdominal pain, and may have alump or mass that can be felt through the wall of theabdomen.
Fistula formation is the formation of abnormal chan-"
"Fistula formation is the formation of abnormal chan-
nels. These channels may connect one area of the intes-tine to another neighboring section of intestine. Fistualsmay join an area of the intestine to the vagina or bladder,or they may drain an area of the intestine through theskin. Abscesses and fistulas commonly affect the areaaround the anus and rectum (the very last portions of thecolon allowing waste to leave the body). These abnormalconnections allow the bacteria that normally live in theintestine to enter other areas of the body, causing poten-tially serious infections.
Patients suffering from Crohn’s disease also have a
significant chance of experiencing other disorders. Someof these may relate specifically to the intestinal disease,and others appear to have some relationship to the imbal-anced immune system. The faulty absorption state of thebowel can result in gallstones and kidney stones ."
"Inflamed areas in the abdomen may press on the tube thatdrains urine from the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).Ureter compression can make urine back up into the kid-ney, enlarge the ureter and kidney, and can potentiallylead to kidney damage. Patients with Crohn’s diseasealso frequently suffer from:
• arthritis (inflammation of the joints)• spondylitis (inflammation of the vertebrae, the bones of
the spine)
• ulcers of the mouth and skin• painful, red bumps on the skin
• inflammation of several eye areas
• inflammation of the liver, gallbladder, and/or the chan-
nels (ducts) that carry bile between and within the liver,gallbladder, and intestine

greater than normal among patients with Crohn’s dis-ease, although this chance is not as high as among thosepatients with ulcerative colitis

During an endoscopic exam, a doctor passes a flexi-
ble tube with a tiny, fiber-optic camera device throughthe rectum and into the colon. The doctor can then care-fully examine the lining of the intestine for signs ofinflammation and ulceration that might suggest Crohn’sdisease. A tiny sample (a biopsy) of the intestine canalso be taken through the endoscope, and the tissue willbe examined under a microscope for evidence ofCrohn’s disease.KEY TERMS

"While Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are sim-
ilar, they are also very different. Although it can be diffi-cult to determine whether a patient has Crohn’s diseaseor ulcerative colitis, it is important to make every effortto distinguish between these two diseases. Because thelong-term complications of the diseases are different,treatment will depend on careful diagnosis of the specificIBD present.
Treatment
Treatments for Crohn’s disease try to reduce the
underlying inflammation, the resulting malabsorption/malnutrition, the uncomfortable symptoms of crampyabdominal pain and diarrhea, and the possible complica-tions (obstructions, abscesses, and fistulas).
Inflammation can be treated with a drug called sul-
fasalazine. Sulfasalazine is made up of two parts. One partis related to the sulfa antibiotics ; the other part is a form
of the anti-inflammatory chemical, salicylic acid (relatedto aspirin ). Sulfasalazine is not well absorbed from the"
"intestine, so it stays mostly within the intestine, where it isbroken down into its components. It is believed that thesalicylic acid component actively treats Crohn’s disease byfighting inflammation. Some patients do not respond tosulfasalazine, and require steroid medications (such asprednisone). Steroids, however, must be used carefully toavoid the complications of these drugs, includingincreased risk of infection and weakening of bones ( osteo-
porosis ). Some very potent immunosuppressive drugs,
which interfere with the products of the immune systemand can hopefully decrease inflammation, may be used forthose patients who do not improve on steroids.

Infliximab is administered through infusion,and consists of a monoclonal antibody that interferes withthe inflammatory process mediated by tumor necrosisfactor-alpha (TNF-a). Patients taking infliximab seem tobe able to decrease their use of steroid medications, andrequire fewer surgical interventions. Furthermore, inflix-imab is the first medication approved for treating fistulas.Unfortunately, infliximab can only be used on a short-term basis, because its interference with TNF-a activitycan also predispose patients to serious infection.

Serious cases of malabsorption/malnutrition may
need to be treated by providing nutritional supplements.These supplements must be in a form that can beabsorbed from the damaged, inflamed intestine. Somepatients find that certain foods are hard to digest, includ-ing milk, large quantities of fiber, and spicy foods. Whenpatients are suffering from an obstruction, or during peri-ods of time when symptoms of the disease are at theirworst, they may need to drink specially formulated, high-calorie liquid supplements.

"A number of medications are available to help
decrease the cramping and pain associated with Crohn’sdisease. These include loperamide, tincture of opium,and codeine. Some fiber preparations (methylcellulose orpsyllium) may be helpful, although some patients do nottolerate them well.

"Prognosis
Crohn’s disease is a life-long illness. The severity of
the disease can vary, and a patient can experience periodsof time when the disease is not active and he or she issymptom-free. However, the complications and risks ofCrohn’s disease tend to increase over time. Well over60% of all patients with Crohn’s disease will requiresurgery, and about half of these patients will requiremore than one operation over time. About 5–10% of allCrohn’s patients will die of their disease, primarily due
to massive infection.

Croup
Definition
Croup is a common childhood ailment. Typically, it
arises from a viral infection of the larynx (voice box) andis associated with mild upper respiratory symptoms suchas a runny nose and cough . The key symptom is a harsh"
"barking cough. Croup is usually not serious, and mostchildren recover within a few days. In a small percentageof cases, a child develops breathing difficulties and mayneed medical attention.
Description
At one time, the term croup was primarily associated
with diphtheria , a life-threatening respiratory infection.
Owing to widespread vaccinations, diphtheria hasbecome rare in the United States, and croup currently

"refers to a mild viral infection of the larynx. Croup is also
known as laryngotracheitis, a medical term that describesthe inflammation of the trachea (windpipe) and larynx.
Parainfluenza viruses are the typical root cause of
the infection, but influenza (flu) and cold viruses may
sometimes be responsible. All of these viruses are highlycontagious and easily transmitted between individualsvia sneezing and coughing. Children between the ages ofthree months and six years are usually affected, with thegreatest incidence at one to two years of age. Croup canoccur at any time of the year, but it is most typical duringearly autumn and winter. The characteristic harsh bark-ing of a croupy cough can be very distressing, but itrarely indicates a serious problem. Most children withcroup can be treated very effectively at home; however,1–5% may require medical treatment.
Croup may sometimes be confused with more seri-
ous conditions, such as epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis."
"ous conditions, such as epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis.
These ailments arise from bacterial infection and mustreceive medical treatment.
Causes and symptoms
Owing to an upper respiratory viral infection, the
larynx and trachea may become inflamed or swollen. Thehallmark sign of croup is a harsh, barking cough. Thiscough may be preceded by one to three days of symp-toms that resemble a slight cold. A croupy cough is oftenaccompanied by a runny nose, hoarseness, and a lowfever . When the child inhales, there may be a raspy or
high-pitched noise, called stridor , owing to the narrowed
airway and accumulated mucus. In the presence of stri-dor, medical attention is required.
However, the airway rarely narrows so much that
breathing is impeded. Symptoms usually abate complete-ly within a few days. Medical treatment may be sought ifthe child’s symptoms do not respond to home treatment.
Emergency medical treatment is required immediate-"
"Emergency medical treatment is required immediate-
ly if the child has difficulty breathing, swallowing, or talk-ing; develops a high fever (103°F/39.4°C or more); seemsunalert or confused; or has pale or blue-tinged skin.
Diagnosis
Croup is diagnosed based on the symptoms. If
symptoms are particularly severe, or do not respond totreatment, an x ray of the throat area is done to assess thepossibility of epiglottitis or other blockage of the airway.
Treatment
Home treatment is the usual method of managing
croup symptoms. It is important that the child is keptcomfortable and calm to the best degree possible, because"
"crying can make symptoms seem worse. Humid air canhelp a child with croup feel more comfortable. Recom-mended methods include sitting in a steamy bathroomwith the hot water running or using a cool-water vaporizeror humidifier. Breathing may also be eased by going out-side into cooler air. The child should drink frequently inorder to stay well hydrated. To treat any fever, the childmay be given an appropriate dose of acetaminophen
(like Tylenol). Antihistamines and decongestants are
ineffective in treating croup. Children under the age of 18should not be given aspirin, as it may cause Reye’s syn-
drome , a life-threatening disease of the brain.
If the child does not respond to home treatment,
medical treatment at a doctor’s office or an emergencyroom could be necessary. Based on the severity of symp-toms and the response to treatment, the child may need tobe admitted to a hospital.
For immediate symptom relief, epinephrine may be"
"For immediate symptom relief, epinephrine may be
administered as an inhaled aerosol. Effects last for up totwo hours, but there is a possibility that symptoms mayreturn. For that reason, the child is kept under supervi-sion for three or more hours. Another effective drug is aglucocorticoid, dexamethasone. This drug requires moretime to take effect, but is longer lasting. It can be admin-istered orally or as an injection. Another glucocorticoid,budesonide, has been used outside the United States fortreating croup. It is administered as an inhaled aerosoland has been shown to be effective; however, it is notavailable as a treatment option in the United States.
Of the 1–5% of children requiring medical treat-
ment, approximately 1% need respiratory support. Suchsupport involves intubation (inserting a tube into the tra-chea) and oxygen administration.
Alternative treatment

"Alternative treatment
Botanical/herbal medicines can be helpful in healing
the cough that is commonly associated with croup. Sev-eral herbs to consider for cough treatment includeaniseed ( Pimpinella anisum ), sundew ( Drosera rotundi-
folia ), thyme ( Thymus vulgaris ), and wild cherry bark
(Prunus serotina ). Homeopathic medicine can be very
effective in treating cases of croup. Choosing the correctremedy (a common choice is aconite or monkshood,Aconitum napellus ) is always the key to the success of
this type of treatment.
Prognosis
Croup is a temporary condition and children typically
recover completely within three to six days. Children canexperience one or more episodes of croup during earlychildhood; however, croup is rarely a dangerous condition.

Cryoglobulin clumps in cold temperatures. This
physical characteristic causes people with cryoglobulinto have symptoms during cold weather: blanching,numbness, and pain in their fingers or toes (Raynaud’s
phenomenon); bleeding into the skin (purpura); and painin joints (arthralgia). People with these symptoms or anyother symptoms that appear in cold weather should betested for cryoglobulin.
Diseases that cause the body to make extra or abnor-
mal proteins are often associated with cryoglobulin.These diseases include cancers involving white bloodcells, infections, autoimmune disorders , and rheuma-
toid diseases.
This test provides information about the cause of
symptoms in a person who already has a disease process.It doesn’t diagnose a specific disease or monitor thecourse of a disease.
Precautions
This test is not a screening test for disease in a per-
son without symptoms.
Description
Laboratory testing for cryoglobulin is based on the"
"son without symptoms.
Description
Laboratory testing for cryoglobulin is based on the
fact that cryoglobulin clumps when cooled and dissolveswhen warmed. The test is done on a person’s serum (theyellow liquid part of blood that separates from the cellsafter the blood clots). The serum is kept warm from thetime drawn until the cells and the serum are separated inthe laboratory. The serum is placed at 33.8°F (1°C) forone to seven days. If there is clumping, cryoglobulins arepresent. The amount of cryoglobulins is determined bymeasuring the amount of clumping. Negative tests arechecked through seven days.
Additional testing is done to find out what kind of
cryoglobulin protein is present. There are three kinds ofcryoglobulin, each associated with different diseases.

Definition
Cryotherapy is a technique that uses an extremely
cold liquid or instrument to freeze and destroy abnormalskin cells that require removal. The technique has been inuse since the turn of the century, but modern techniqueshave made it widely available to dermatologists and pri-mary care doctors. The technique is also calledcryosurgery.
Purpose
Cryotherapy can be employed to destroy a variety of
benign skin growths, such as warts , pre-cancerous lesions
(such as actinic keratoses), and malignant lesions (such asbasal cell and squamous cell cancers). The goal ofcryotherapy is to freeze and destroy targeted skin growthswhile preserving the surrounding skin from injury.

"nant melanoma should not be treated with cryotherapy,
but should instead be removed surgically. Similarly, basalcell or squamous cell carcinomas that have reappeared atthe site of a previously treated tumor should also beremoved surgically. If it remains unclear whether agrowth is benign or malignant, a sample of tissue shouldbe removed for analysis (biopsy) by a pathologist beforeany attempts to destroy the lesion with cryotherapy. Careshould be taken in people with diabetes or certain circula-tion problems when cryotherapy is considered forgrowths located on their lower legs, ankles, and feet. Inthese patients, healing can be poor and the risk of infec-tion can be higher than for other patients.
Description
There are three main techniques to performing
cryotherapy. In the simplest technique, usually reservedfor warts and other benign skin growths, the physician
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 962CryotherapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 962"
will dip a cotton swab or other applicator into a cup con-
"taining a “cryogen,” such as liquid nitrogen, and apply itdirectly to the skin growth to freeze it. At a temperature of-320°F (-196°C), liquid nitrogen is the coldest cryogenavailable. The goal is to freeze the skin growth as quicklyas possible, and then let it thaw slowly to cause maximumdestruction of the skin cells. A second application may benecessary depending on the size of the growth. In anothercryotherapy technique, a device is used to direct a smallspray of liquid nitrogen or other cryogen directly onto theskin growth. Freezing may last from five to 20 seconds,depending on the size of the lesion. A second freeze-thawcycle may be required. Sometimes, the physician willinsert a small needle connected to a thermometer into thelesion to make certain the lesion is cooled to a lowenough temperature to guarantee maximum destruction.In a third option, liquid nitrogen or another cryogen is cir-culated through a probe to cool it to low temperatures.The probe is then brought into direct"
is cir-culated through a probe to cool it to low temperatures.The probe is then brought into direct contact with the skinlesion to freeze it. The freeze time can take two to threetimes longer than with the spray technique.
"Preparation
Extensive preparation prior to cryotherapy is not
required. The area to be treated should be clean and dry,but sterile preparation is not necessary. Patients shouldknow that they will experience some pain at the time of
the freezing, but local anesthesia is usually not required.The physician may want to reduce the size of certaingrowths, such as warts, prior to the cryotherapy proce-dure, and may have patients apply salicylic acid prepara-tions to the growth over several weeks. Sometimes, thephysician will pare away some of the tissue using adevice called a curette or a scalpel.
Aftercare
Redness, swelling, and the formation of a blister at the
site of cryotherapy are all expected results of the treatment.A gauze dressing is applied and patients should wash thesite three or four times daily while fluid continues to oozefrom the wound, usually for five to 14 days. A dry crustthen forms that falls off by itself. Wounds on the head and"
"neck may take four to six weeks to heal, but those on thebody, arms, and legs can take longer. Some patients experi-ence pain at the site following the treatment. This can usu-ally be eased with acetaminophen (Tylenol), though in
some cases a stronger pain reliever may be required.

Cryptococcosis
Definition
Cryptococcosis is an infection caused by inhaling
the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans . It is one of the dis-
eases most often affecting AIDS patients. Cryptococco-
sis may be limited to the lungs, but frequently spreadsthroughout the body. Although almost any organ can beinfected, the fungus is often fatal if it infects the nervoussystem where it causes an inflammation of the mem-branes covering the brain and spinal cord ( meningitis ).

"Description
The fungus causing cryptococcus, C. neoformans ,i s
found worldwide in soil contaminated with pigeon orother bird droppings. It has also been found on unwashedraw fruit. Cryptococcosis is a rare disease in healthyindividuals, but is the most common fungal infectionaffecting people with AIDS.
People with Hodgkin’s disease or who are taking
large doses of drugs that suppress the functioning of theimmune system ( corticosteroids ,chemotherapy drugs)
are also more susceptible to cryptococcal infection.Cryptococcosis is also called cryptococcal meningitis(when the brain is infected), Busse-Buschke disease,European blastomycosis , torular meningitis, or torulosis.
Causes and symptoms

"Causes and symptoms
Once the cryptococcal fungus reaches the lungs,
three things can happen. The immune system can healthe body without medical intervention, the disease canstay localized in the lungs, or it can spread throughoutthe body. In healthy people with normally functioningimmune systems, the body usually heals itself, and theinfected person notices no symptoms and has no compli-cations (asymptomatic). The disease does not spreadfrom one person to another.
Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic infection that
puts people with immune system diseases at higher riskof developing more serious forms of the disease. In theUnited States, 6–10% of all patients with AIDS get cryp-tococcosis.
If the body does not heal itself, the fungus begins to
grow in the lungs and form nodules that can be seen onchest x rays. In the early stages of infection, an individ-ual usually only exhibits symptoms of a respiratoryinfection, such as a dry cough , so the disease is rarely
diagnosed."
"diagnosed.
The fungus can remain dormant in the lungs and
produce an active infection later if the immune system isweakened. If the disease becomes active, it can causecryptococcal pneumonia in the lungs. Unfortunately,
however, cryptococcal pneumonia has symptoms similarto other pneumonias (cough, chest pain , difficulty
breathing), making it difficult to accurately diagnose.The infection can spread to other parts of the body, par-ticularly the brain and central nervous system.
Most patients are not diagnosed as having crypto-
coccosis until they show signs of cryptococcal meningi-tis, or infection of the membranes surrounding the brainand spinal cord. Symptoms appear gradually over a peri-od of two to four weeks. Fever and headache are the
most common symptoms, occurring in about 85% ofpatients. Nausea, vomiting, unwanted weight loss, andfatigue are also common. Other symptoms seen in"
"25–30% of patients are blurred vision, stiff neck, aver-sion to light, and seizures. Since the symptoms of classic

"meningitis, such as stiff neck and aversion to light, do not
occur in many patients, diagnosis is often delayed. Inaddition to meningitis, inflammation of the brain(encephalitis ) and brain lesions called cryptococcomas
or tortulomas can also develop.
In addition to the brain, the cryptococcal infection
can spread to the kidneys, bone marrow, heart, adrenalglands, lymph nodes, urinary tract, blood, and skin.Often times preceding the development of cryptococcalmeningitis, painless rashes and lesions that mimic other
skin diseases, such as molluscum contagiosum , may
develop. A small percentage of patients with brain infec-tions show infections in other organs as well.
Diagnosis
Physicians who regularly work with AIDS patients"
"Diagnosis
Physicians who regularly work with AIDS patients
have the most experience in diagnosing cryptococcosis.The preferred methods of diagnosis use simple and veryaccurate blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests thatdetect the presence of an antigen produced by the fungus.The cerebrospinal fluid test is generally more sensitive todetecting the meningitis form of the infection. CSF iscollected during a procedure called a lumbar puncture,during which an anesthetic is applied to a small area ofthe back near the spine and a needle is used to withdrawa sample of cerebrospinal fluid from the space betweenthe vertebrae and the spinal cord. Once obtained, a smallamount of ink (called India ink) is added to a sample ofCSF or a sample prepared from skin lesions . If the fun-"
"gus is present, it will become visible when the ink bindsto the capsule or covering that surrounds the fungus.Faster results are obtained with the India ink test, but it isless accurate than the blood test (75–85% accuracy com-pared to 99% accuracy with the blood test) because somestrains are not visible using this method. Antigen testsare routinely recommended for non-symptomaticpatients with advanced AIDS.
Another way to diagnose cryptococcosis is to cul-
ture a sample of sputum, tissue from a lung biopsy ,o r
CSF in the laboratory to isolate the fungus. Cultures arealso done to assess the effectiveness of treatment.
Chest x rays are useful in assessing lung damage and
may reveal a single mass or multiple distinct nodules, butthe x ray alone does not lead to a definitive diagnosis ofcryptococcosis.
Treatment

"Treatment
Once cryptococcosis is diagnosed, treatment begins
with amphotericin B (Fungizone), sometimes in combi-nation with 5-flucytosine (Ancobon). Amphotericin B isa powerful fungistatic drug with potentially toxic sideeffects, such as kidney toxicity and lower concentrations
of an important blood component called hemoglobin.This medication can also cause fever, chills, nausea and
vomiting ,diarrhea , headache, and muscle aches. Treat-
ment is generally given intravenously during a hospitalstay and continues until the patient is stable or improving(no more than two to three weeks). 5-flucytosine is givenorally. Patients may also receive other medication tominimize the side effects from these drugs.
Amphotericin B, with or without 5-flucytosine, is"
"Amphotericin B, with or without 5-flucytosine, is
given for several weeks until the patient is stable, afterwhich the patient receives oral fluconazole (Diflucan).Fluconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal drug with fewserious side effects. Patient with AIDS must continue tak-ing fluconazole for the rest of their lives to prevent arelapse of cryptococcosis. Sometimes fluconazole isgiven to patients with advanced AIDS as a preventative(prophylactic) measure.
Because of the high cost of fluconazole, the manu-
facturer of the drug, Pfizer, has established a financialassistance plan to make the drug available at lower costto those who meet certain criteria. Patients needing thisdrug should ask their doctors about this program.

"Prognosis
Untreated cryptococcosis is always fatal. The acute
mortality rate for patients with AIDS is 10–25%. Mostdeaths are attributable to cryptococcal meningitis andoccur within two weeks after diagnosis. For AIDSpatients who do not receive continued suppressive thera-py (fluconazole), the relapse rate is 50–60% within sixmonths and a shortened life expectancy. Once the crypto-coccosis infection has been successfully treated, individ-uals may be left with a variety of neurologic symptoms,

In addition, fluid may accumulate around the brain(hydrocephalus ).
Prevention
The best way to prevent cryptococcosis is to stay free of
HIV infection. People with suppressed immune systemsshould try to stay away from areas contaminated with pigeonor other bird droppings, such as the attics of old buildings,barns, and areas under bridges where pigeons roost.

"Cryptosporidiosis
Definition
Cryptosporidiosis refers to infection by the spore-
forming protozoan known as Cryptosporidia . Protozoa are
a group of parasites that infect the human intestine, andinclude the better known Giardia . Cryptosporidia was first
identified in 1976 as a cause of disease in humans.
Description
Cryptosporidia are normally passed in the feces of
infected persons and animals in the form of cysts. Thecysts can remain in the ground and water for months, andwhen ingested produce symptoms after maturing in theintestine and the bile ducts. When viewed under themicroscope, they appear as small bluish-staining roundbodies. Most common sources of infection are otherhumans, water supplies, or reservoirs. These are contam-inated by animals that defecate in these areas. An out-break in Milwaukee in 1993 in which over 400,000 per-sons were affected was traced to the city’s water supply.Cysts of Cryptosporidia are extremely resistant to the"
"disinfectants that are commonly used in most water treat-ment plants and are incompletely removed by filtration.
Most persons who experience significant symptoms
have an altered immune system, and suffer from diseasessuch as AIDS and cancer . However, as shown in the
Milwaukee outbreak, even those with normal immunitycan experience symptoms.
Causes and symptoms
Cysts of Cryptosporidia mature in the intestine and
bile ducts within three to five days of ingestion. As noted,large-scale infections from contaminated water supplieshas been documented. However, human to human trans-mission (such as occurs in day care centers or throughsexual behavior) is also an important cause.
Many individuals can be infected without any ill-
ness, but the major symptom is diarrhea , which is often
watery and incapacitating. Dehydration , low-grade
fever , nausea, and abdominal cramps are frequent.
In those with a normal immune system, the disease"
"In those with a normal immune system, the disease
usually lasts about 10 days. For patients with altered immu-nity (immunocompromised), the story is quite different,with diarrhea becoming chronic, debilitating, and even fatal.
Complications
Dehydration and malnutrition are the most com-
mon effects of infection. In about 20% of AIDS patients,bile duct infection also occurs and causes symptoms sim-ilar to gallbladder attacks. Eighty percent or more ofthose with infection of the bile ducts die from the dis-ease. The lungs and pancreas are also sometimesinvolved. Cryptosporidia are just one cause of the diar-
rhea wasting syndrome in AIDS, which results in severeweight loss and malnutrition.
Diagnosis
This is based on either finding the characteristic
cysts in stool specimens, or on biopsy of an infectedorgan, such as the intestine.
Treatment
The first aim of treatment is to avoid dehydration."
"Treatment
The first aim of treatment is to avoid dehydration.
Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or intravenous fluidsmay be needed. Medications used to treat diarrhea bydecreasing intestinal motility (Anti-Motility Agents),such as loperamide or diphenoxylate, are also useful, butshould only be used with the advice of a physician.
Treatment aimed directly at Cryptosporidia is only
partially effective, and rarely eliminates the organism.The medication most commonly used is paromomycin(Humatin), but others are presently under evaluation.
Prognosis
Cryptosporidia rarely cause a serious disease in per-
sons with normal immune systems. Replacement of fluidsis all that is usually needed. On the other hand, those withaltered immune systems often suffer for months to years.Paramomycin and other drugs have been able to improvesymptoms in over half of those treated. Unfortunately,many organisms are resistant, and recurrence is frequent.
Prevention"
"Prevention
The best way to prevent cryptosporidiosis is to mini-
mize exposure to cysts from infected humans and ani-mals. Proper hand washing technique, especially in daycare centers, is recommended.

CT-guided biopsy
Definition
Computed tomography (CT) is a process that images
anatomic information from a cross-sectional plane of thebody. Biopsy is the process of taking a sample of tissuefrom the body for analysis. CT is commonly used inbiopsies to provide images that help guide the tools orequipment necessary to perform the biopsy to the appro-priate area of the body.
Purpose
CT is used in the process of performing a biopsy,
such as a needle biopsy, in order to guide the needle tothe site of the biopsy and to provide rapid and preciselocalization of the needle. CT enables imaging of areasthat are normally beyond visible boundaries. Thisenables the physician to see the target area clearly andhelp to ensure that the tissue being removed is from thetarget lesion.

Culture-fair test
Definition
A culture-fair test is a test designed to be free of cul-
tural bias, as far as possible, so that no one culture has anadvantage over another. The test is designed to not beinfluenced by verbal ability, cultural climate, or educa-tional level.
Purpose
The purpose of a culture-fair test is to eliminate any
social or cultural advantages, or disadvantages, that aperson may have due to their upbringing. The test can beadministered to anyone, from any nation, speaking anylanguage. A culture-fair test may help identify learningor emotional problems. The duration of the test varies forthe individual types of tests available, but the time isapproximately between 12–18 minutes per section (a testusually has two to four sections)."
"A culture-fair test is often administered by employ-
ers in order to determine the best location for newemployees in a large company. The wide variety of cul-ture-fair tests availiable allows the administrator toselect which area is most vital, whether it be generalintelligence, knowledge of a specific area, or emotionalstability.
Precautions
There is doubt as to whether any test can truly be
culturally unbiased or can ever be made completely fairto all persons independent of culture. There are no otherprecautions.
Description
A culture-fair test is a non-verbal paper-pencil test
that can be administered to patients as young as four

"years old. The patient only needs the ability to recognize
shapes and figures and perceive their respective relation-ships. Some examples of tasks in the test may include:
• completing series• classifying
• solving matrices
• evaluating conditions
The culture-fair test is also often referred to as a cul-
ture-free test or unbiased test. There are many variationsof the test including class, economic, and intelligencetests. The threading theme among the various tests istheir design to be culturally unbiased.
Preparation
The only preparation necessary to administer the test
is pre-ordered materials and a quiet and secluded loca-tion for the duration of the test.
Aftercare
Post-test treatment depends on the results of the test
and the specifics of the individual patient. Any furthertreatment is best prescribed by the doctor.

"Definition
Cushing’s syndrome is a relatively rare endocrine
(hormonal) disorder resulting from excessive exposure tothe hormone cortisol. The disorder, which leads to a vari-ety of symptoms and physical abnormalities, is mostcommonly caused by taking medications containing thehormone over a long period of time. A more rare form ofthe disorder occurs when the body itself produces anexcessive amount of cortisol.

"Description
The adrenals are two glands, each of which is perched
on the upper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of thegland is known as the cortex; the inner part is known as themedulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal gland is respon-sible for producing different types of hormones. Regulationof hormone production and release from the adrenal cortexinvolves the pituitary gland, a small gland located at thebase of the brain. After the hypothalamus (the part of thebrain containing secretions important to metabolic activi-ties) sends “releasing hormones” to the pituitary gland, thepituitary secretes a hormone called adrenocorticotropichormone (ACTH). The ACTH then travels through thebloodstream to the adrenal cortex, where it encourages theproduction and release of cortisol (sometimes called the“stress” hormone) and other adrenocortical hormones.

"Cortisol, a very potent glucocorticoid—a group of
adrenocortical hormones that protects the body fromstress and affect protein and carbohydrate metabolism—
is involved in regulating the functioning of nearly everytype of organ and tissue in the body, and is considered tobe one of the few hormones absolutely necessary for life.Cortisol is involved in:
• complex processing and utilization of many nutrients,
including sugars (carbohydrates), fats, and proteins
• normal functioning of the circulatory system and the
heart
• functioning of muscles• normal kidney function• production of blood cells
• normal processes involved in maintaining the skeletal
system
• proper functioning of the brain and nerves• normal responses of the immune system
Cushing’s syndrome, also called hypercortisolism,
has an adverse effect on all of the processes described
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 970Cushing’s syndromeGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 970"
"above. The syndrome occurs in approximately 10 to 15
out of every one million people per year, usually strikingadults between the ages of 20 and 50.
Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is
the long-term use of glucocorticoid hormones in medica-tions. Medications such as prednisone are used in a num-ber of inflammatory conditions. Such conditions includerheumatoid arthritis ,asthma ,vasculitis , lupus, and a
variety of other autoimmune disorders in which the
body’s immune cells accidentally attack some part of thebody itself. In these disorders, the glucocorticoids areused to dampen the immune response, thereby decreas-ing damage to the body.
Cushing’s syndrome can also be caused by three dif-
ferent categories of disease:
• a pituitary tumor producing abnormally large quantities
of ACTH
• the abnormal production of ACTH by some source
other than the pituitary
• a tumor within the adrenal gland overproducing cortisol"
"other than the pituitary
• a tumor within the adrenal gland overproducing cortisol
Although it is rare, about two-thirds of endoge-
nous (occurring within the body rather than from asource outside the body, like a medication) Cushing’ssyndrome is a result of Cushing’s disease. The term“Cushing’s disease” refers to Cushing’s syndrome,which is caused by excessive secretion of ACTH by apituitary tumor, usually an adenoma (noncanceroustumor). The pituitary tumor causes increased growth ofthe adrenal cortex (hyperplasia) and increased cortisolproduction. Cushing’s disease affects women moreoften than men.

"Tumors in locations other than the pituitary can also
produce ACTH. This is called ectopic ACTH syndrome(“ectopic” refers to something existing out of its normalplace). Tumors in the lung account for more than half ofall cases of ectopic ACTH syndrome. Other types oftumors that may produce ACTH include tumors of thethymus, the pancreas, the thyroid, and the adrenal gland.Nearly all adrenal gland tumors are benign (noncancer-ous), although in rare instances a tumor may actually becancerous.
Symptoms of cortisol excess (resulting from med-
ication or from the body’s excess production of the hor-mone) include:
• weight gain
• an abnormal accumulation of fatty pads in the face (cre-
ating the distinctive “moon face” of Cushing’s syn-drome); in the trunk (termed “truncal obesity”); andover the upper back and the back of the neck (giving the
individual what has been called a “buffalo hump”)

"24-hour free cortisol test
This is the most specific diagnostic test for identify-
ing Cushing’s syndrome. It involves measuring theamount of cortisol present in the urine over a 24-hourperiod. When excess cortisol is present in the blood-stream, it is processed by the kidneys and removed aswaste in the urine. This 24-hour free cortisol test requiresthat an individual collect exactly 24-hours’ worth ofurine in a single container. The urine is then analyzed ina laboratory to determine the quantity of cortisol present.This technique can also be paired with the administrationof dexamethasone, which in a normal individual wouldcause urine cortisol to be very low. Once a diagnosis hasbeen made using the 24-hour free cortisol test, other testsare used to find the exact location of the abnormalitycausing excess cortisol production.

"Dexamethasone suppression test
This test is useful in distinguishing individuals with
excess ACTH production due to a pituitary adenomafrom those with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors.Patients are given dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocor-ticoid) orally every six hours for four days. Low doses ofdexamethasone are given during the first two days; forthe last two days, higher doses are administered. Beforedexamethasone is administered, as well as on each day ofthe test, 24-hour urine collections are obtained.
Because cortisol and other glucocorticoids signal the
pituitary to decrease ACTH, the normal response aftertaking dexamethasone is a drop in blood and urine corti-sol levels. Thus, the cortisol response to dexamethasonediffers depending on whether the cause of Cushing’s syn-drome is a pituitary adenoma or an ectopic ACTH-pro-ducing tumor.

"However, the dexamethasone suppression test may
produce false-positive results in patients with conditionssuch as depression, alcohol abuse, high estrogen levels,acute illness, and stress. On the other hand, drugs such asphenytoin and phenobarbital may produce false-negativeresults. Thus, patients are usually advised to stop takingthese drugs at least one week prior to the test.
Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)
stimulation test
The CRH stimulation test is given to help distin-
guish between patients with pituitary adenomas and

"those with either ectopic ACTH syndrome or cortisol-
secreting adrenal tumors. In this test, patients are givenan injection of CRH, the corticotropin-releasing hor-mone that causes the pituitary to secrete ACTH. Inpatients with pituitary adenomas, blood levels of ACTHand cortisol usually rise. However, in patients withectopic ACTH syndrome, this rise is rarely seen. Inpatients with cortisol-secreting adrenal tumors, this risealmost never occurs.
Petrosal sinus sampling
Although this test is not always necessary, it may be
used to distinguish between a pituitary adenoma and anectopic source of ACTH. Petrosal sinus sampling involvesdrawing blood directly from veins that drain the pituitary.This test, which is usually performed with local anesthe-sia and mild sedation , requires inserting tiny, flexible"
"tubes (catheters) through a vein in the upper thigh orgroin area. The catheters are then threaded up slowly untilthey reach veins in an area of the skull known as the pet-rosal sinuses. X rays are typically used to confirm the cor-rect position of the catheters. Often CRH is also givenduring the test to increase the accuracy of results.
When blood tested from the petrosal sinuses reveals
a higher ACTH level than blood drawn from a vein in theforearm, the likely diagnosis is a pituitary adenoma.When the two samples show similar levels of ACTH, thediagnosis indicates ectopic ACTH syndrome.

"Imaging tests such as computed tomography scans
(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are only
used to look at the pituitary and adrenal glands after afirm diagnosis has already been made. The presence of apituitary or adrenal tumor does not necessarily guaranteethat it is the source of increased ACTH production. Manyhealthy people with no symptoms or disease whatsoeverhave noncancerous tumors in the pituitary and adrenalglands. Thus, CT and MRI is often used to image thepituitary and adrenal glands in preparation for surgery.
Treatment
The choice of a specific treatment depends on the
type of problem causing the cortisol excess. Pituitary andadrenal adenomas are usually removed surgically. Malig-nant adrenal tumors always require surgical removal.
Treatment of ectopic ACTH syndrome also involves
removing all of the cancerous cells that are producingACTH. This may be done through surgery, chemothera-
py(using combinations of cancer-killing drugs), or radi-"
"py(using combinations of cancer-killing drugs), or radi-
ation therapy (using x rays to kill cancer cells), depend-ing on the type of cancer and how far it has spread. Radi-
ation therapy may also be used on the pituitary (with orwithout surgery) for patients who cannot undergosurgery, or for patients whose surgery did not successful-ly decrease pituitary release of ACTH.
There are a number of drugs that are effective in
decreasing adrenal production of cortisol. These medica-tions include mitotane, ketoconazole, metyrapone,trilostane, aminoglutethimide, and mifepristone . These
drugs are sometimes given prior to surgery in an effort toreverse the problems brought on by cortisol excess. How-ever, the drugs may also need to be administered aftersurgery (sometimes along with radiation treatments) inpatients who continue to have excess pituitary productionof ACTH.
Because pituitary surgery can cause ACTH levels to"
"Because pituitary surgery can cause ACTH levels to
drop too low, some patients require short-term treatmentwith a cortisol-like medication after surgery. Patientswho need adrenal surgery may also require glucocorti-coid replacement. If the entire adrenal gland has beenremoved, the patient must take oral glucocorticoids forthe rest of his or her life.
Prognosis
Prognosis depends on the source of the problem.
When pituitary adenomas are identified as the source ofincreased ACTH leading to cortisol excess, about 80% ofpatients are cured by surgery. When cortisol excess isdue to some other form of cancer, the prognosis dependson the type of cancer and the extent of its spread.

Cutaneous larva migrans
Definition
Cutaneous larvae migrans is a parasitic skin disease
caused by a hookworm larvae that usually infests dogs,cats, and other animals. Humans can pick up the infec-tion by walking barefoot on soil or beaches contaminatedwith animal feces.
Description
Cutaneous larvae migrans (also called “creeping
eruption” or “ground itch”) is found in southeastern andGulf states, and in tropical developing countries.
The hookworms that cause the condition are small,"
"The hookworms that cause the condition are small,
round blood-sucking worms that infest about 700 millionpeople around the world. Cutaneous larvae migransoccurs most often among children, those who crawlbeneath raised buildings, and sunbathers who lie downon wet sand contaminated with hookworm larvae.
Causes and symptoms
After an animal passes feces that are infested with
hookworm eggs, the eggs hatch into infective larvae thatare able to penetrate human skin (even through solidmaterial, such as a beach towel). The larvae are common-ly found in shaded, moist, or sandy areas (such as beach-es, a child’s sandbox, or areas underneath a house),where they are easily picked up by bare feet or buttocks.
In minor infestations, there may be no symptoms at
all. In more severe cases, a red elevation of the skin(papule) appears within a few hours after the larvae havepenetrated the skin. This usually arises first in areas thatare in contact with the soil, such as the feet, hands, andbuttocks."
"Between a few days and a few months after infec-
tion, the larvae begin to migrate beneath the skin, leavingextremely itchy red lines that may be accompanied byblisters. These red lines usually appear at the top of thesole of the foot or on the buttocks.
Tyically, the larvae travel through the bloodstream, to
the lungs, and then migrate into the mouth where they areswallowed and attach to the small intestine lining. Therethey mature into adult worms. In cases where the larvaemigrate through the lungs, they can produce anemia,cough , and pneumonia , in addition to the itchy rash.
Diagnosis
The condition can be diagnosed by microscopic
inspection of feces which can reveal hookworm eggs. Inaddition visual inspection of the skin would reveal tell-tale itchy red lines and blisters.
Treatment

treatment, since the worms will eventually die or be"

"excreted. Thiabendazole or albendazole are used to treat
the infestation. Mild infections can be treated by apply-ing one of the drugs to the skin along the tracks and thenormal skin surrounding the area. Thiabendazole alsocan be given internally, but taken this way it can causeside effects including dizziness , nausea, and vomiting
Prognosis
No matter how severe an infestation, with adequate
treatment patients recover completely. However, if thepatient scratches the lesions open, the areas can becomevulnerable to bacterial infection.
Prevention
In the United States, the prevalence of dogs and cats
with hookworms is the reason why the infective larvaeare found so commonly in soil and sand. The play habitsof children, together with their attraction to pets, putsthem at high risk for hookworm infection and cutaneouslarvae migrans.
Human hookworm infestation can be prevented by"
"Human hookworm infestation can be prevented by
practicing good personal hygiene, deworming pets, andnot allowing children to play in potentially contaminatedenvironments.

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a malignan-
cy of the T-helper (CD4+) cells of the immune system.KEY TERMS

CTCL, also known as mycosis fungoides, is a cancer"
"CTCL, also known as mycosis fungoides, is a cancer
of the white blood cells that primarily affects the skin andonly secondarily affects other sites. This disease involvesthe uncontrollable proliferation of T-lymphocytes knownas T-helper cells, so named because of their role in theimmune response. T-helper cells are characterized by thepresence of a protein receptor on its surface called CD4.Accordingly, T-helper cells are said to be CD4+.
The proliferation of T-helper cells results in the pen-"
"The proliferation of T-helper cells results in the pen-
etration, or infiltration, of these abnormal cells into theepidermal layer of the skin. The skin reacts with slightlyscaling lesions that itch, although the sites of greatestinfiltration do not necessarily correspond to the sites ofthe lesions. The lesions are most often located on thetrunk, but can be present on any part of the body. In themost common course of the disease, the patchy lesionsprogress to palpable plaques that are deeper red and havemore defined edges. As the disease worsens, skin tumorsdevelop that are often mushroom-shaped, hence thename mycosis fungoides. Finally, the cancer progressesto extracutanous involvement, often in the lymph nodesor the viscera.
CTCL is a rare disease, with an annual incidence of"
"CTCL is a rare disease, with an annual incidence of
about 0.29 cases per 100,000 persons in the UnitedStates. It is about half as common in Eastern Europe.However, this discrepancy may be attributed to a differ-ing physician awareness of the disease rather than a truedifference in occurrence. In the Unites States, there areabout 500 to 600 new cases a year and about 100 to 200deaths. Usually seen in older adults, the median age atdiagnosis is 55 to 60 years, and it strikes twice as manymen as women.
Causes and symptoms
The cause of CTCL is unknown. Exposure to chemi-
cals or pesticides has been suggested but the most recentstudy on the subject failed to show a connection betweenexposure and development of the disease. The ability toisolate various viruses from cell lines grown from cells ofCTCL patients raises the question of a viral cause, butstudies have been unable to confirm these suspicions.

"The symptoms of CTCL are seen primarily in the
skin, with itchy red patches or plaques and, usually overtime, mushroom-shaped skin tumors. Any part of theskin can be involved and the extent and distribution ofthe rash or tumors vary greatly from patient to patient.The only really universal symptom of the disease is theitch and this symptom is usually what brings the patientto the doctor for treatment. If the disease spreads outsideof the skin, the symptoms include swelling of the lymph

"nodes, usually most severe in those draining the areas
with skin involvement. Spread to the viscera is mostoften manifested as disorders of the lungs, upper diges-tive tract, central nervous system, or liver but virtuallyany organ can be shown to be involved at autopsy .
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of CTCL is often difficult in the early
stages because of its slow progression and ability tomimic many other benign skin conditions. The earlypatches of CTCL resemble eczema, psoriasis , and con-
tact dermatitis . In a further complication, the early man-
ifestations of the disease can respond favorably to thetopical corticosteroid treatments prescribed for these skindisorders. This has the unfortunate result of the diseasebeing missed and the patient remaining untreated foryears. CTCL is most likely discovered when a physicianmaintains a suspicion about the disease, performs multi-ple skin biopsies, and provides close follow-up after theinitial presentation."
"Skin biopsies showing penetration of abnormal cells
into the epidermal tissue are necessary to make a firmdiagnosis of CTCL. Several molecular studies can alsohelp support the diagnosis. The first looks at the cellularproteins seen on the surface of the abnormal cells. Manycases of CTCL show the retention of the CD4+ protein,but the loss of other proteins usually seen on the surfaceof mature CD4+ cells, such as Leu-8 or Leu-9. Theabnormal cells also show unusual rearrangements at thegenetic level for the gene that encodes the T-cell recep-tors. These rearrangements can be identified usingSouthern blot analysis. The information from the molec-ular tests, combined with the presence of abnormal cellsin the epidermis, strongly supports the CTCL diagnosis.
Treatment

"Treatment
Treatment of CTCL depends on the stage of the dis-
ease. The current staging of this disease was first presentedat the International Consensus Conference on CTCL in1997. The staging attempts to show the complex interac-tion between the various outward symptoms of the diseaseand prognosis. The system has seven clinical stages basedon skin involvement (tumor = T), lymph node involvement(LN), and presence of visceral metastases (M).
The first stage, IA, is characterized by plaques cov-
ering less than 10% of the body (T1) and no visceralinvolvement (M0). Lymph node condition at this stagecan be uninvolved, reactive to the skin disease, or der-matopathic (biopsies showing CTCL involvement) butnot enlarged (LN0-2). The shorthand expression of thisstage is therefore T1, LN0-2, M0. The next stage, IB, dif-fers from IA in that greater than 10% of the body is cov-"
"ered by plaques (T2, LN0-2, M0). Stage IIA occurs withany amount of plaques in addition to the ability to pal-pate the lymph node and the lymph uninvolved, reactive,or dermatopathic (T1-2, LN0-2, M0).
Treatments applied to the skin are preferred for
patients having these preliminary stages of the disease,commonly topical chemotherapy with mechlorethamine
hydrochloride (nitrogen mustard) or phototherapy of"
"hydrochloride (nitrogen mustard) or phototherapy of
psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUV A). Topical chemothera-py involves application to the skin of nitrogen mustard,an alkylating agent, in a concentration of 10–20 mg/dLin an aqueous or ointment base. Treatment of affectedskin is suggested at a minimum and application over theentire skin surface is often recommended. Care needs tobe taken that coverage of involved skin is adequate, aspatients who self-apply the drug often cannot reach allaffected areas. The most common side effect is skinhypersensitivity to the drug. Nearly all patients respondfavorably to this treatment, with a 32–61% completeresponse rate, based on amount of skin involvement.Unfortunately, only 10–15% of patients maintain a com-plete response rate after discontinuing the treatment.
Phototherapy involves treatment with an orally"
"Phototherapy involves treatment with an orally
administered drug, 8-methyloxypsoralen, that renders theskin sensitive to long-wave ultraviolet light (UV A), fol-lowed by controlled exposure to the radiation. During theinitial treatment period, which may last as long as sixmonths, patients are treated two to three times weekly.This is reduced to about once monthly after initial clear-ing of the lesions. Redness of the skin and blistering arethe most common side effects of the treatment and aremuch more common in patients presenting with overallskin redness, or erythroderma, so lower intensities oflight are usually used in this case. About 50% of allpatients experience complete clearance with this treat-ment. Some patients with very fair skin and limited skininvolvement can successfully treat themselves at homewith special lamps and no psoralen.
The next stage, IIB, involves one or more cutaneous"
"The next stage, IIB, involves one or more cutaneous
tumors, in combination with absent or present palpablelymph nodes, lymph uninvolved, reactive, or dermatopath-ic, and no visceral involvement (T3, LN0-2, M0). Stage IIIis characterized by erythroderma, an abnormal rednessover widespread areas of the skin (T4, LN0-2, M0).
For more extensive disease, radiation therapy is an
effective treatment option. It is generally used after thetopical treatments have proven ineffective. Individualplaques or tumors can be treated using electrons, ortho-voltage x rays, or megavoltage photons with exposure inthe range of 15 to 25 Gy. Photon therapy has proven par-ticularly useful once the lymph nodes are involved. Anoth-

"er possibility is total-skin electron beam therapy (TSEB),
although the availability of this treatment method is limit-ed. It involves irradiation of the entire body with energizedelectrons. Side effects of this treatment include loss of fin-ger and toe nails, acute redness of the skin, and inability tosweat for about six to 12 months after therapy. Almost allpatients respond favorably to radiation treatment and anyreoccurrence is usually much less severe.
Combinations of different types of treatments is a very"
"Combinations of different types of treatments is a very
common approach to the management of CTCL. Topicalnitrogen mustard or PUV A is often used after completionof radiation treatment to prolong the effects. The additionof genetically engineered interferon to PUV A therapy sig-nificantly increases the percentage of patients showing acomplete response. Furthermore, although treatments usingchemotherapy drugs alone, such as deoxycofomycin oretretinate, have been disappointing for CTCL, combiningthese drugs with interferon has shown promising results.Interferon has also been combined with retinoid treatments,although the mechanism of action of retinoids (Vitamin Aanalogues) against CTCL is unknown.
The final two stages of the disease are IV A and IVB."
"The final two stages of the disease are IV A and IVB.
IV A presents as any amount of skin involvement, absentor present palpable lymph nodes, no visceral involve-ment, and lymph that contains large clusters of convolut-ed cells or obliterated nodes (T1-4, LN3-4). IVB differsin the addition of palpable lymph nodes and visceralinvolvement (T1-4, LN3-4, M1). All of the treatmentmethods described above are appropriate for the finaltwo stages of the disease.
Alternative treatment
Itching of the skin is one of the most troublesome
symptoms of CTCL. One alternative treatment for itchi-ness is the application of a brewed solution of chickweedthat is applied to the skin using cloth compresses. Anoth-er suggested topical application is a mixture of vitaminE, vitamin A, unflavored yogurt, honey, and zinc oxide.Evening primrose oil applied topically is also claimed toreduce itch and promote healing.

"Prognosis
The prognosis for CTCL is dependent on the stage of
the disease. Prognosis is very good if the disease has onlyprogressed to Stage IA, with a mean survival of 20 ormore years. At this point, the disease is a very low mortali-ty risk to the patient, with most deaths occurring to per-sons in this group unrelated to CTCL. For patients diag-nosed at stages IB and IIA, the median survival is about 12years. The disease in both of these stages involves inter-mediate risk to the patient.

later stages, the disease is high risk, with most deathsoccurring by infection due to the depleted immune systemof the later-stage patient. Once a patient has reached stageIVB, the mean life expectancy is one year.

"Cutis laxa
Definition
Cutis laxa (Latin for loose or lax skin) is a connec-
tive tissue disorder in which the skin lacks elasticity andhangs in loose folds.
Description
Cutis laxa is extremely rare; less than a few hundred
cases worldwide have been described.
The several forms of cutis laxa are divided into pri-
mary cutis laxa, which is present from birth and is hered-itary, secondary cutis laxa, which arises later in life andmay be either hereditary, and acquired cutis laxa, whicharises later in life and is not hereditary. Loose skin, theprimary and most obvious symptom of these diseases, iscaused by underlying defects in connective tissue struc-ture, which also cause more serious internal problems invocal cords, bones, cartilage, blood vessels, bladder, kid-ney, digestive system, and lungs. The loose skin is partic-ularly obvious on the face, and children with the disorderlook sad or mournful.
There are four genetic forms of the disease: sex-"
"There are four genetic forms of the disease: sex-
linked, autosomal dominant, and two types of autosomalrecessive inheritance. The recessive forms are the mostcommon and are usually more severe than the other forms.
Causes and Symptoms
Sex-linked cutis laxa is caused by a defective gene on
the X chromosome. In addition to loose skin, its symp-toms are mild mental retardation , loose joints, bone
abnormalities (like hooked nose, pigeon breast, and fun-nel breast), frequent loose stools, urinary tract blockages,and deficiencies in lysyl oxidase, an enzyme required forthe formation of properly functioning connective tissue.(But the defective gene does not code for lysyl oxidase.)
Autosomal dominant cutis laxa is caused by a defec-
tive gene carried on an autosomal (not sex-linked) chro-mosome. Its symptoms are loose, hanging skin, missingelastic fibers, premature aging , and pulmonary emphy-

"sema . Only a few families are known with cutis laxa
inherited as a dominant trait.
Autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 1 is caused by a
defective gene on chromosome 5. Symptoms includeemphysema; diverticula in the esophagus, duodenum,and bladder; lax and dislocated joints; tortuous arteries;hernias; lysyl oxidase deficiencies; and retarded growth.
Autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2 is also inherit-
ed as a recessive trait. In addition to the loose skin, thisform of the disease is characterized by bone abnormali-ties, the delayed joining of the cranial (skull) bones, hipdislocation, curvature of the spine, flat feet, and exces-sive tooth decay .
Acquired cutis laxa tends to follow (and may be
caused by) severe illness characterized by fever , inflam-
mation, and a severe skin rash ( erythema multiforme );
an injury to the nerves that control blood vessel dilationand contraction; or an autoimmune condition.

"Diagnosis
The signs of cutis laxa are very obvious, and it is
usually easy to diagnose by examining the skin. Thedetermination of which form of cutis laxa is present isaided by information about the associated symptoms andby family histories.
Treatment
There is no effective cure for any of these disorders.
Complications are treated by appropriate specialists, forexample, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, rheumatolo-gists, and dermatologists. Plastic surgery can be helpful forcosmetic purposes, but the skin may become loose again.
Prognosis
The prognosis for cutis laxa varies with the form of
the disorder. The effects may be relatively mild with indi-viduals living a fairly normal, full life, or the disease maybe fatal.
Prevention
The inherited forms of cutis laxa are genetically
determined and are not currently preventable. Genetic

"culates back to the lungs through capillaries and veins.
Hemoglobin, as well as blood, is bright red when it containsoxygen, but appears dark or “bluish” after it gives up oxygen.
The blue discoloration of cyanosis is seen most
readily in the beds of the fingernails and toenails, andon the lips and tongue. It often appears transiently as aresult of slowed blood flow through the skin due to thecold. As such, it is not a serious symptom. However, inother cases, cyanosis is a serious symptom of underly-ing disease.
Causes and symptoms
The blue color of the skin and mucous membranes
is caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood. Low bloodoxygen may be caused by poor blood circulation, orheart or breathing problems. It can also be caused bybeing in a low-oxygen environment or by carbon
monoxide poisoning . More rarely, cyanosis can be pre-

Other signs of low blood oxygen may accompany
cyanosis, including feeling lightheaded or fainting .

Cyclic vomiting syndrome
Definition
Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a rare disorder
characterized by recurring periods of vomiting in an oth-erwise normal child.
Description
Children in the pre-school or early school years are
most susceptible to CVS, although it can appear any-where from infancy to adulthood. This disorder wasidentified a century ago, but its cause is still unknown.Episodes can be triggered by emotional stress or infec-"
"tions, can last hours or days, and can return at any time.Abdominal pain is a frequent feature.
Causes and symptoms
The cause of CVS is still a mystery. Similarities to
migraine suggest a common cause, but as yet no firm evi-dence has surfaced. Patients can usually identify somefactor that precedes an attack. V omiting can be protractedand lead to complications such as dehydration , chemi-
cal imbalances, tearing and burning, and bleeding of theesophagus (swallowing tube). Between attacks, there isno sign of any illness.

"Diagnosis
The most important and difficult aspect of CVS is to
be sure there is not an acute and life-threatening event inprogress. So many diseases can cause vomiting—frombowel obstruction to epilepsy—that an accurate and time-ly diagnosis is critical. Because there is no way to provethe diagnosis of CVS, the physician must instead disproveevery other diagnosis. This can be tedious, expensive,exhausting, and involve almost every system in the body.The first episode may be diagnosed as a stomach flu whennothing more serious turns up. Only after several episodesand several fruitless searches for a cause will a physiciannormally consider the diagnosis of CVS.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 980Cyclic vomiting syndromeGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 980"
"Treatment
Several different medications have given good
results in small trials. The antimigraine drugs
amitriptyline and cyproheptadine performed well for onestudy group. Propanolol is sometimes effective, and ery-thromycin helped several patients in one study, notbecause it is an antibiotic but because it irritates thestomach and encourages it to move its contents forwardinstead of in reverse.
Alternative treatment
Constitutional homeopathic medicine can work well
in treating CVS because it addresses rebalancing thewhole person, not just the symptoms.
Prognosis
The disease may go on for many years without a
change in pattern. If the acute complications of prolongedvomiting can be successfully prevented or managed, mostpatients can lead normal lives between episodes. Medica-tions may ease the symptoms during attacks.

Cyclosporiasis
Definition
Cyclosporiasis refers to infection by the spore-form-
ing protozoan known as Cyclospora . Protozoa are a
group of parasites that infect the human intestine. Para-sites are organisms that live in another body, called thehost, and get food and liquids from that host. This para-site is a member of the group of protozoa known as coc-cidia, to which Cryptosporidia also belongs. This group"
"of parasites infects the human intestine, and causeschronic recurrent infections in those with altered immu-nity or AIDS . Even in people with normal immune func-
tion, Cyclopsora can cause prolonged bouts of diarrhea
and other gastrointestinal symptoms.
Description
Until recently, Cyclospora was considered to be a
form of algae. The parasite causes a common form ofwaterborne infectious diarrhea throughout the world. Justhow the parasite gets into water sources is not yet clear. Itis known that ingestion of small cysts in contaminatedwater leads to disease.
Causes and symptoms
Symptoms begin after an incubation period of about a
day or so following ingestion of cysts. A brief period of flu-like illness characterized by weakness and low-grade fever"
"is followed by watery diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, andmuscle aches. In some patients, symptoms may wax andwane for weeks, and there are those in whom nausea andburping may predominate. It is also believed that infectioncan occur without any symptoms at all.
In patients with abnormal immunity (immunocom-
promised patients), such as those with AIDS and cancer ,
prolonged diarrhea and severe weight loss often becomea major problem. The bile ducts are also susceptible toinfection in AIDS patients.
Diagnosis
The disease should be suspected in anyone with a
history of prolonged or recurrent diarrhea. The parasite isidentified either by staining stool specimens or by apply-

"ing certain fluorescent ultraviolet techniques to find the
characteristic cysts. Biopsy of an infected organ such asthe intestine through an endoscope is another way tomake the diagnosis.
Treatment
The first aim of treatment as with any severe diar-
rheal illness is to avoid dehydration and malnutrition .
Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or intravenous fluidsare sometimes needed. Medications used to treat diarrheaby decreasing intestinal motility, such as loperamide ordiphenoxylate are also useful, but should only be usedwith the advice of a physician.KEY TERMS
Anti-motility medications —Medications such as
loperamide (sold as Imodium), dephenoxylate(sold as Lomotil), or medications containingcodeine or narcotics that decrease the ability ofthe intestine to contract. This can worsen the con-dition of a patient with dysentery or colitis.
Cyst—A protective sac that includes either fluid or"
"Cyst—A protective sac that includes either fluid or
the cell of an organism. The cyst enables manyorganisms to survive in the environment for longperiods of time without need for food or water.
Immunocompromised —A change or alteration of
the immune system that normally serves to fightoff infections other illnesses. This can involvechanges in antibodies that the body produces(hygogammaglobulinemia), or a defect in the cellsthat partake in the immune response. Diseasessuch as AIDS and cancer exhibit changes in thebody’s natural immunity.
Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) —A liquid
preparation developed by the World Health Orga-nization that can decrease fluid loss in personswith diarrhea. Originally developed to be pre-pared with materials available in the home, com-mercial preparations have recently come into use.
Parasite —An organism that lives on or in another
and takes nourishment (food and fluids) from thatorganism.
Protozoa —Group of extremely small single cell"
"Protozoa —Group of extremely small single cell
(unicellular) or acellular organisms that are foundin moist soil or water. They tend to exist as para-sites, living off other life forms.
Spore —A resistant form of certain species of bac-
teria, protozoa, and other organisms.The use of the medication, trimethoprim-sulfameth-
oxazole (Bactrim) for one week can be successful intreating intestinal infections and prevents relapse in thosewith a normal immune system. The same medicine canbe prescribed to treat infections of both the intestine orbile ducts in immunocompromised individuals, but main-tenance or continuous treatment is often needed.
Prognosis
The outlook is quite good for individuals in whom a
diagnosis is made. Even without treatment, symptomsusually do not last much more than a month or so exceptin cases with altered immunity. Fortunately, treatment isusually successful even in those patients.

"Prevention
Aside from a waterborne source as the origin of
infection, little else is known about how the parasite istransmitted. Therefore, little can be done regarding pre-vention, except to maintain proper hand washing tech-niques and hygiene.

Purpose
Cystectomy is performed to treat cancer of the blad-
der. Radiation and chemotherapy are also used to treat
bladder cancer . Surgery is used to remove cancer when
it is in the muscle of the bladder.
Precautions
Cystectomy is an aggressive treatment that may not
be appropriate for patients with superficial tumors thatrespond to more conservative treatment.

"Description
Cystectomy is a major surgical operation. The
patient is placed under general anesthesia. An incision ismade across the lower abdomen. The ureters are located,tied and cut. The ureters connect the kidneys to the blad-der. Cutting them frees the bladder for removal. Thebladder and associated organs are removed. In men, theprostate is removed with the bladder. In women, theuterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and part of the vagina areremoved with the bladder. The bladder collects urinefrom the kidneys for excretion at a later time. Since thebladder is removed, a new method must be created toremove the urine. A small piece of the small intestine isremoved, cleaned, and tied at one end to form a tube. Theother end is used to form a stoma, an opening through theabdominal wall to the outside. The ureters are then con-nected to the tube. Urine produced by the kidneys nowflows down the ureters, into the tube, and through thestoma. The patient wears a bag to collect the urine."
"Preparation
The medical team will discuss the procedure and tell
the patient where the stoma will appear and what it willlook like. The patient receives instruction on caring for astoma and bag. Counseling may be initiated. A period offasting and an enema may be required.KEY TERMS
Ureters —Tubes that connect the kidneys to the
bladder. Urine produced by the kidneys passesthrough the ureters to the bladder.
Aftercare
After the operation, the patient is given fluid-based
nutrition until the intestines being to function normally
again. Antibiotics are given to prevent infection of the
incision sites. The nature of the organs removed meanthat there will be major lifestyle changes for the personundergoing the operation. Men will become impotentbecause nerves controlling penile erection are cut duringremoval of the bladder. In women, infertility is a conse-"
"quence because the ovaries and uterus are removed.However, most women who undergo cystectomy arepostmenopausal and past their childbearing years.
Both men and women are fitted with an external bag
that connects to the stoma and collects the urine. The bagis generally worn around the waist under the clothing. Ittakes a period of adjustment to get used to wearing thebag. Because there is no bladder, urine is excreted as it isproduced, essentially continuously. The stoma must betreated properly to ensure that it does not become infect-ed or blocked. Patients must be trained to care for theirstoma. Often there is a period of psychological adjust-ment to the major change in life style created by thestoma and bag. Patients should be prepared for this bydiscussion with their physician.
Risks
As with any major surgery, there is a risk of infec-
tion; in this case, infection of the intestine is especiallydangerous as it can lead to peritonitis (inflammation of
the membrane lining the abdomen)."
"the membrane lining the abdomen).
Normal results
The bladder is successfully removed and a stoma
created. Intestinal function returns to normal and thepatient learns proper care of the stoma and bag. He or sheadjusts to lifestyle changes and returns to a normal rou-tine of work and recreation, some sports excluded.
Abnormal results
The patient develops an infection at the incision site.

Cystic fibrosis
Definition
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that
affects the lungs, digestive system, sweat glands, andmale fertility. Its name derives from the fibrous scar tis-sue that develops in the pancreas, one of the principalorgans affected by the disease.
Description
Cystic fibrosis affects the body’s ability to move salt
and water in and out of cells. This defect causes the lungsand pancreas to secrete thick mucus, blocking passage-ways and preventing proper function."
"CF affects approximately 30,000 children and young
adults in the United States, and about 3,000 babies areborn with CF every year. CF primarily affects people ofwhite northern-European descent; rates are much lowerin non-white populations.
Many of the symptoms of CF can be treated with
drugs or nutritional supplements. Close attention to andprompt treatment of respiratory and digestive complica-tions have dramatically increased the expected life spanof a person with CF. While several decades ago mostchildren with CF died by age two, today about half of allpeople with CF live past age 31. That median age isexpected to grow as new treatments are developed, and itis estimated that a person born in 1998 with CF has amedian expected life span of 40 years.

"Causes and symptoms
Causes
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease, meaning it is
caused by a defect in the person’s genes. Genes, found inthe nucleus of all the body’s cells, control cell functionby serving as the blueprint for the production of proteins.Proteins carry out a wide variety of functions withincells. The gene that, when defective, causes CF, is calledthe CFTR gene, which stands for cystic fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator. A simple defect in thisgene leads to all the consequences of CF. There are over500 known defects in the CFTR gene that can cause CF.However, 70% of all people with a defective CFTR genehave the same defect, known as delta-F508.
Much as sentences are composed of long strings of"
"Much as sentences are composed of long strings of
words, each made of letters; genes can be thought of aslong strings of chemical words, each made of chemicalletters, called nucleotides. Just as a sentence can bechanged by rearranging its letters, genes can be mutated,or changed, by changes in the sequence of theirnucleotide letters. The gene defects in CF are calledpoint mutations, meaning that the gene is mutated only atone small spot along its length. In other words, the delta-F508 mutation is a loss of one “letter” out of thousandswithin the CFTR gene. As a result, the CFTR proteinmade from its blueprint is made incorrectly, and cannotperform its function properly.
The CFTR protein helps to produce mucus. Mucus is"
"The CFTR protein helps to produce mucus. Mucus is
a complex mixture of salts, water, sugars, and proteins thatcleanses, lubricates, and protects many passageways in thebody, including those in the lungs and pancreas. The roleof the CFTR protein is to allow chloride ions to exit themucus-producing cells. When the chloride ions leave thesecells, water follows, thinning the mucus. In this way, theCFTR protein helps to keep mucus from becoming thickand sluggish, thus allowing the mucus to be moved steadi-ly along the passageways to aid in cleansing.
In CF, the CFTR protein cannot allow chloride ions
out of the mucus-producing cells. With less chlorideleaving, less water leaves, and the mucus becomes thickand sticky. It can no longer move freely through the pas-sageways, so they become clogged. In the pancreas,clogged passageways prevent secretion of digestiveenzymes into the intestine, causing serious impairmentof digestion—especially of fat—which may lead to mal-"
"nutrition . Mucus in the lungs may plug the airways, pre-
venting good air exchange and, ultimately, leading toemphysema . The mucus is also a rich source of nutrients
for bacteria, leading to frequent infections.
INHERITANCE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS. To understand
the inheritance pattern of CF, it is important to realize thatgenes actually have two functions. First, as noted above,they serve as the blueprint for the production of proteins.Second, they are the material of inheritance: parents passon characteristics to their children by combining thegenes in egg and sperm to make a new individual.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 984Cystic fibrosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 984"
"Each person actually has two copies of each gene,
including the CFTR gene, in each of their body cells. Dur-ing sperm and egg production, however, these two copiesseparate, so that each sperm or egg contains only one copyof each gene. When sperm and egg unite, the newly creat-ed cell once again has two copies of each gene.
The two gene copies may be the same or they may
be slightly different. For the CFTR gene, for instance, aperson may have two normal copies, or one normal andone mutated copy, or two mutated copies. A person withtwo mutated copies will develop cystic fibrosis. A personwith one mutated copy is said to be a carrier. A carrierwill not have symptoms of CF, but can pass on the mutat-ed CFTR gene to his/her children.
When two carriers have children, they have a one in
four chance of having a child with CF each time theyconceive. They have a two in four chance of having achild who is a carrier, and a one in four chance of havinga child with two normal CFTR genes."
"Approximately one in every 25 Americans of north-
ern-European descent is a carrier of the mutated CFgene, while only one in 17,000 African Americans andone in 30,000 Asian Americans are carriers. Since carri-ers are symptom-free, very few people will knowwhether or not they are carriers unless there is a familyhistory of the disease. Two white Americans with nofamily history of CF have a one in 2,500 chance of hav-
ing a child with CF.
It may seem puzzling that a mutated gene with such
harmful consequences would remain so common; onemight guess that the high mortality of CF would quicklylead to loss of the mutated gene from the population.Some researchers now believe the reason for the persis-tence of the CF gene is that carriers, those with only onecopy of the gene, are protected from the full effects ofcholera , a microorganism that infects the intestine, caus-
ing intense diarrhea and eventual death by dehydra-
tion. It is believed that having one copy of the CF gene is"
"tion. It is believed that having one copy of the CF gene is
enough to prevent the full effects of cholera infection,while not enough to cause the symptoms of CF. This so-called “heterozygote advantage” is seen in some othergenetic disorders, including sickle-cell anemia.
Symptoms
The most severe effects of cystic fibrosis are seen in
two body systems: the gastrointestinal (digestive) sys-tem, and the respiratory tract, from the nose to the lungs.CF also affects the sweat glands and male fertility.Symptoms develop gradually, with gastrointestinalsymptoms often the first to appear.
GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM. Ten to fifteen percent
of babies who inherit CF have meconium ileus at birth.

"Meconium is the first dark stool that a baby passes after
birth; ileus is an obstruction of the digestive tract. Themeconium of a newborn with meconium ileus is thick-ened and sticky, due to the presence of thickened mucusfrom the intestinal glands. Meconium ileus causesabdominal swelling and vomiting, and often requiressurgery immediately after birth. Presence of meconiumileus is considered highly indicative of CF. Borderlinecases may be misdiagnosed, however, and attributedinstead to “milk allergy.”
Other abdominal symptoms are caused by the inabil-
ity of the pancreas to supply digestive enzymes to theintestine. During normal digestion, as food passes fromthe stomach into the small intestine, it is mixed with pan-creatic secretions which help to break down the nutrientsfor absorption. While the intestines themselves also pro-vide some digestive enzymes, the pancreas is the majorsource of enzymes for the digestion of all types of foods,especially fats and proteins."
"In CF, thick mucus blocks the pancreatic duct,
which is eventually closed off completely by scar tissueformation, leading to a condition known as pancreaticinsufficiency. Without pancreatic enzymes, largeamounts of undigested food pass into the large intes-tine. Bacterial action on this rich food source can causegas and abdominal swelling. The large amount of fatremaining in the feces makes it bulky, oily, and foul-smelling.
Because nutrients are only poorly digested and
absorbed, the person with CF is often ravenously hungry,underweight, and shorter than expected for his age.When CF is not treated for a longer period, a child maydevelop symptoms of malnutrition, including anemia,bloating, and, paradoxically, appetite loss.
Diabetes becomes increasingly likely as a person
with CF ages. Scarring of the pancreas slowly destroysthose pancreatic cells which produce insulin, producingtype I, or insulin-dependent diabetes.

"Gall stones affect approximately 10% of adults with
CF. Liver problems are less common, but can be caused bythe buildup of fat within the liver. Complications of liverenlargement may include internal hemorrhaging, abdomi-nal fluid ( ascites ), spleen enlargement, and liver failure.
Other gastrointestinal symptoms can include a pro-
lapsed rectum, in which part of the rectal lining protrudesthrough the anus; intestinal obstruction; and rarely,intussusception , in which part of the intestinal tube slips
over an adjoining part, cutting off blood supply.
Somewhat less than 10% of people with CF do not
have gastrointestinal symptoms. Most of these people donot have the delta-F508 mutation, but rather a differentone, which presumably allows at least some of their
CFTR proteins to function normally in the pancreas.

"RESPIRATORY TRACT. The respiratory tract includes
the nose, the throat, the trachea (or windpipe), thebronchi (which branch off from the trachea within eachlung), the smaller bronchioles, and the blind sacs calledalveoli, in which gas exchange takes place between airand blood.
Swelling of the sinuses within the nose is common
in people with CF. This usually shows up on x-ray, andmay aid the diagnosis of CF. However, this swelling,called pansinusitis, rarely causes problems, and does notusually require treatment.
Nasal polyps , or growths, affect about one in five
people with CF. These growths are not cancerous, and donot require removal unless they become annoying. Whilenasal polyps appear in older people without CF, especiallythose with allergies , they are rare in children without CF.
The lungs are the site of the most life-threatening"
"The lungs are the site of the most life-threatening
effects of CF. The production of a thick, sticky mucusincreases the likelihood of infection, decreases the abil-ity to protect against infection, causes inflammationand swelling, decreases the functional capacity of thelungs, and may lead to emphysema. People with CFwill live with chronic populations of bacteria in theirlungs, and lung infection is the major cause of death forthose with CF.
The bronchioles and bronchi normally produce a
thin, clear mucus that traps foreign particles includingbacteria and viruses. Tiny hair-like projections on thesurface of these passageways slowly sweep the mucusalong, out of the lungs and up the trachea to the back ofthe throat, where it may be swallowed or coughed up.This “mucociliary escalator” is one of the principaldefenses against lung infection.
The thickened mucus of CF prevents easy movement"
"The thickened mucus of CF prevents easy movement
out of the lungs, and increases the irritation and inflam-mation of lung tissue. This inflammation swells the pas-sageways, partially closing them down, further hamper-ing the movement of mucus. A person with CF is likelyto cough more frequently and more vigorously as the
lungs attempt to clean themselves out.
At the same time, infection becomes more likely
since the mucus is a rich source of nutrients. Bronchitis ,
bronchiolitis, and pneumonia are frequent in CF. The
most common infecting organisms are the bacteriaStaphylococcus aureus ,Haemophilus influenzae , and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa . A small percentage of people
with CF have infections caused by Burkholderia cepacia ,
a bacterium which is resistant to most current antibiotics
(Burkholderia cepacia was formerly known as

"Pseudomonas cepacia .) The fungus Aspergillus fumiga-
tusmay infect older children and adults.
The body’s response to infection is to increase
mucus production; white blood cells fighting the infec-tion thicken the mucus even further as they break downand release their cell contents. These white blood cellsalso provoke more inflammation, continuing the down-ward spiral that marks untreated CF.
As mucus accumulates, it can plug up the smaller
passageways in the lungs, decreasing functional lungvolume. Getting enough air can become difficult; tired-ness, shortness of breath , and intolerance of exercise
become more common. Because air passes obstructionsmore easily during inhalation than during exhalation,over time, air becomes trapped in the smallest chambersof the lungs, the alveoli. As millions of alveoli graduallyexpand, the chest takes on the enlarged, barrel-shapedappearance typical of emphysema.

"For unknown reasons, recurrent respiratory infec-
tions lead to “digital clubbing,” in which the last joint ofthe fingers and toes becomes slightly enlarged.
SWEAT GLANDS. The CFTR protein helps to regulate
the amount of salt in sweat. People with CF have sweatthat is much saltier than normal, and measuring the salti-ness of a person’s sweat is the most important diagnostictest for CF. Parents may notice that their infants taste saltywhen they kiss them. Excess salt loss is not usually a prob-lem except during prolonged exercise or heat. While mostolder children and adults with CF compensate for thisextra salt loss by eating more salty foods, infants andyoung children are in danger of suffering its effects (suchas heat prostration), especially during summer. Heat pros-tration is marked by lethargy, weakness, and loss ofappetite, and should be treated as an emergency condition.

"FERTILITY. Ninety-eight percent of men with CF are
sterile, due to complete obstruction or absence of the vasdeferens, the tube carrying sperm out of the testes. Whileboys and men with CF form normal sperm and have nor-mal levels of sex hormones, sperm are unable to leave thetestes, and fertilization is not possible. Most women withCF are fertile, though they often have more trouble get-ting pregnant than women without CF. In both boys andgirls, puberty is often delayed, most likely due to the
effects of poor nutrition or chronic lung infection.
Women with good lung health usually have no problemswith pregnancy , while those with ongoing lung infec-
tion often do poorly.

"Sweat test
The sweat test is both the easiest and most accurate
test for CF. In this test, a small amount of the drug pilo-carpine is placed on the skin. A very small electrical cur-rent is then applied to the area, which drives the pilo-carpine into the skin. The drug stimulates sweating in thetreated area. The sweat is absorbed onto a piece of filterpaper, and is then analyzed for its salt content. A personwith CF will have salt concentrations that are one-and-one-half to two times greater than normal. The test canbe done on persons of any age, including newborns, andits results can be determined within an hour. Virtuallyevery person who has CF will test positively on it, andvirtually everyone who does not will test negatively.
Genetic testing
The discovery of the CFTR gene in 1989 allowed
the development of an accurate genetic test for CF.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 987Cystic fibrosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 987"
"Genes from a small blood or tissue sample are analyzed
for specific mutations; presence of two copies of themutated gene confirms the diagnosis of CF in all but avery few cases. However, since there are so many differ-ent possible mutations, and since testing for all of themwould be too expensive and time-consuming, a negativegene test cannot rule out the possibility of CF.

"sis. Many couples who already have one child with CF
decide to undergo prenatal screening in subsequent preg-nancies, and use the results to determine whether to ter-minate the pregnancy. Siblings in these families are alsousually tested, both to determine if they will develop CF,and to determine if they are carriers, to aid in their ownfamily planning. If the sibling has no symptoms, deter-mining his carrier status is often delayed until his teenyears or later, when he is closer to needing the informa-tion to make decisions.
Newborn screening
Some states now require screening of newborns for
CF, using a test known as the IRT test. This is a blood testwhich measures the level of immunoreactive trypsino-gen, which is generally higher in babies with CF thanthose without it. This test gives many false positiveresults immediately after birth, and so requires a secondtest several weeks later. A second positive result is usual-ly followed by a sweat test.
Treatment"
"Treatment
There is no cure for CF. Treatment has advanced con-
siderably in the past several decades, increasing both thelife span and the quality of life for most people affectedby CF. Early diagnosis is important to prevent malnutri-tion and infection from weakening the young child. Withproper management, many people with CF engage in thefull range of school and sports activities.
Nutrition
People with CF usually require high-calorie diets
and vitamin supplements. Height, weight, and growth ofa person with CF are monitored regularly. Most peoplewith CF need to take pancreatic enzymes to supplementor replace the inadequate secretions of the pancreas.Tablets containing pancreatic enzymes are taken withevery meal; depending on the size of the tablet and themeal, as many as 20 tablets may be needed. Because ofincomplete absorption even with pancreatic enzymes, aperson with CF needs to take in about 30% more foodthan a person without CF. Low-fat diets are notrecom-"
"mended except in special circumstances, since fat is asource of both essential fatty acids and abundant calories.
Some people with CF cannot absorb enough nutri-
ents from the foods they eat, even with specialized dietsand enzymes. For these people, tube feeding is an option.Nutrients can be introduced directly into the stomachthrough a tube inserted either through the nose (a naso-gastric tube) or through the abdominal wall (a gastrosto-
mytube). A jejunostomy tube, inserted into the small
intestine, is also an option. Tube feeding can providenutrition at any time, including at night while the personis sleeping, allowing constant intake of high-qualitynutrients. The feeding tube may be removed during theday, allowing normal meals to be taken.

"Respiratory health
The key to maintaining respiratory health in a person
with CF is regular monitoring and early treatment. Lungfunction tests are done frequently to track changes infunctional lung volume and respiratory effort. Sputumsamples are analyzed to determine the types of bacteriapresent in the lungs. Chest x rays are usually taken atleast once a year. Lung scans, using a radioactive gas,can show closed off areas not seen on the x ray. Circula-tion in the lungs may be monitored by injection of aradioactive substance into the bloodstream.

Exercise is anoth-er important way to maintain health, and people with CFare encouraged to maintain a program of regular exercise.

"In addition, clearing mucus from the lungs helps to
prevent infection; and mucus control is an importantaspect of CF management. Postural drainage is used toallow gravity to aid the mucociliary escalator. For thistechnique, the person with CF lies on a tilted surface withhead downward, alternately on the stomach, back, or side,depending on the section of lung to be drained. An assis-tant thumps the rib cage to help loosen the secretions. Adevice called a “flutter” offers another way to loosensecretions: it consists of a stainless steel ball in a tube.When a person exhales through it, the ball vibrates, send-ing vibrations back through the air in the lungs. Some spe-cial breathing techniques may also help clear the lungs.
Several drugs are available to prevent the airways
from becoming clogged with mucus. Bronchodilators
and theophyllines open up the airways; steroids reduceinflammation; and mucolytics loosen secretions. Acetyl-"

"cysteine (Mucomyst) has been used as a mucolytic for
many years but is not prescribe frequently now, whileDNase (Pulmozyme) is a newer product gaining in popu-larity. DNase breaks down the DNA from dead whiteblood cells and bacteria found in thick mucus.
People with CF may pick up bacteria from other CF
patients. This is especially true of Burkholderia cepacia ,
which is not usually found in people without CF. Whilethe ideal recommendation from a health standpoint mightbe to avoid contact with others who have CF, this is notusually practical (since CF clinics are a major site of care),nor does it meet the psychological and social needs ofmany people with CF. At a minimum, CF centers recom-mend avoiding prolonged close contact between peoplewith CF, and scrupulous hygiene, including frequent handwashing. Some CF clinics schedule appointments on dif-ferent days for those with and without B. cepacia colonies.

ing infection, while others prefer long-term antibiotic treat-ment against S. aureus . The choice of antibiotic depends on
the particular organism or organisms found. Some antibi-otics are given as aerosols directly into the lungs. Antibiotictreatment may be prolonged and aggressive.
Supplemental oxygen may be needed as lung dis-
ease progresses. Respiratory failure may develop,
requiring temporary use of a ventilator to perform thework of breathing.

"Lung transplantation has become increasingly
common for people with CF, although the number ofpeople who receive them is still much lower than thosewho want them. Transplantation is not a cure, however,and has been likened to trading one disease for another.Long-term immunosuppression is required, increasingthe likelihood of other types of infection. About 50% ofadults and more than 80% of children who receive lungtransplants live longer than two years. Liver transplantsare also done for CF patients whose livers have beendamaged by fibrosis.
Long-term use of ibuprofen has been shown to help
some people with CF, presumably by reducing inflam-mation in the lungs. Close medical supervision is neces-sary, however, since the effective dose is high and noteveryone benefits. Ibuprofen at the required doses inter-feres with kidney function, and together with aminogly-coside antibiotics, may cause kidney failure.

"A number of experimental treatments are currently
the subject of much research. Some evidence indicatesthat aminoglycoside antibiotics may help overcome thegenetic defect in some CF mutations, allowing the pro-tein to be made normally. While promising, these resultswould apply to only about 5% of those with CF.Gene therapy is currently the most ambitious
approach to curing CF. In this set of techniques, non-defective copies of the CFTR gene are delivered toaffected cells, where they are taken up and used to createthe CFTR protein. While elegant and simple in theory,gene therapy has met with a large number of difficultiesin trials so far, including immune resistance, very shortduration of the introduced gene, and inadequately wide-spread delivery.

"Alternative treatment
In homeopathic medicine, the symptoms of the disease
would be addressed to enhance the quality of life for theperson with cystic fibrosis. Treating the cause of CF,because of the genetic basis for the disease, is not possible.Homeopathic medicine seeks to treat the whole person,however, and in CF, this approach might include:
• mucolytics to help thin mucous

passages
• hydrotherapy techniques to help ease the respiratory
symptoms and help the body eliminate

Prognosis
People with CF may lead relatively normal lives with

The possible effect of pregnancyon the health of a woman with CF requires careful consid-eration before beginning a family as do issues of longevi-ty and their children’s status as carriers. Although mostmen with CF are functionally sterile, new procedures forremoving sperm from the testes are being tried, and mayoffer more men the chance to become fathers.
Approximately half of people with CF live past the
age of 30. Because of better and earlier treatment, a per-son born today with CF is expected, on average, to live toage 40.
Prevention
Adults with a family history of cystic fibrosis may
obtain a genetic test of their carrier status for purposes offamily planning. Prenatal testing is also available. Thereis currently no known way to prevent development of CFin a person with two defective gene copies."

Cystinuria

Cystinuria is an inborn error of amino acid transport
that results in the defective absorption by the kidneys ofthe amino acid called cystine. The name means “cystinein the urine.”

"Description
Cystine is an amino acid. Amino acids are organic
compounds needed by the body to make proteins and formany normal functions. When the kidneys don’t absorbcystine, this compound builds up in the urine. When theamount of cystine in the urine exceeds its solubility (thegreatest amount that can be dissolved), crystals form. Asthe amount of cystine continues to increase in the urine,the number of crystals also increases. When very largenumbers of cystine crystals form, they clump togetherinto what is called a stone.

"Causes and symptoms
Cystinuria is a rare disease that occurs when people
inherit an abnormal gene from their parents. This diseaseoccurs in differing degrees of severity in people whohave inherited either one or two abnormal genes.Humans have two copies of each gene. When both areabnormal, the condition is called homozygous for thedisease. When one copy is normal and the other is abnor-mal, the condition is called heterozygous for the disease.Persons with one abnormal gene can have a milder formof cystinuria that rarely results in the formation of stones.
Severe cystinuria occurs when people are homozy-
gous for the disease. For these individuals, the kidneysmay excrete as much as 30 times the normal amount ofcystine. Research has shown that this condition is causedby mutations on chromosome number two (humans have23 pairs of chromosomes).

"A person who has inherited cystinuria may have
other abnormal bodily functions. In addition to excesslevels of the amino acid cystine, high amounts of theamino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine are found inthe urine. This condition indicates that these amino acidsare not being reabsorbed by the body.
When excess cystine crystals clump together to form
a stone, the stone can block portions of the interior of thekidney or the tube (the ureter) that connects the kidney tothe urinary bladder. These cystine stones can be painful,and depending upon where the stone becomes trapped,the pain can be felt in the lower back or the abdomen.
Nausea and vomiting can also occur, and patients may
sometimes feel the need to urinate often. Cystine stonescan also cause blood in the urine. When the urinary tractis blocked by a stone, urinary tract infections or kidneyfailure may result.

"Diagnosis
Small stones (called “silent”) often do not cause any
symptoms, although they can be detected by an x ray.Large stones are often painful and easily noticed by thepatient. Blood in the urine can also mean that a stone hasformed.
When the urine contains extremely high amounts of
cystine, yellow-brown hexagonal crystals are visiblewhen a sample is examined under the microscope. Urinesamples can also be mixed with chemicals that changecolor when high levels of cystine are present. When thecompound nitroprusside is added to urine that has beenmade alkaline by the addition of ammonia, the urinespecimen turns red if it contains excess cystine.

"Treatment
No treatment can decrease cystine excretion. The
best treatment for cystinuria is to prevent stones fromforming. Stones can be prevented by drinking enoughliquid each day (about 5–7 qts) to produce at least 8 ptsof urine, thus keeping the concentration of cystine in theurine low. Because a person doesn’t drink throughout thenight, less urine is produced, and the likelihood of stoneformation increases. This risk can be minimized bydrinking water or other liquids just before going to bed.
Drug treatments
In addition to drinking large amounts of fluids, it is
helpful to make the urine more alkaline. Cystine dis-

alkalinity, a person may take sodium bicarbonate andacetazolamide. Penicillamine, a drug that increases thesolubility of cystine, may be prescribed for patients whodo not respond well to other therapies. This drug must beused with caution, however, because it can cause seriousside effects or allergic reactions. For those unable to takepenicillamine, another drug, alpha-mercaptopropionyl-glycine (Thiola), may be prescribed.
Surgical treatments
Most stones can be removed from the body by nor-
mal urination, helped by drinking large amounts ofwater. Large stones that cannot be passed this way mustbe removed by surgical procedures.

"Large stones can be surgically removed by having a
device called a uretoscope placed into the urethra, upthrough the bladder and into the ureter, where the trappedstone can be seen and removed. Another method involvesusing sound-wave energy aimed from outside the body tobreak the large stone into small pieces that can be passedby urination. This external technique is called extracor-poreal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL).
For large stones in the kidney, a procedure called per-
cutaneous nephrolithomy may be used. In this procedure,the surgeon makes a small incision in the back over thekidney. An instrument called a nephroscope is insertedthrough the incision into the kidney. The surgeon uses thenephroscope to locate and remove the stone. If the stoneis very large, it may be broken up into smaller pieces byan ultrasonic or other kind of probe before removal.

Cystitis
Definition
Cystitis is defined as inflammation of the urinary blad-
der. Urethritis is an inflammation of the urethra, which is
the passageway that connects the bladder with the exteriorof the body. Sometimes cystitis and urethritis are referredto collectively as a lower urinary tract infection, or UTI.Infection of the upper urinary tract involves the spread ofbacteria to the kidney and is called pyelonephritis .
Description
The frequency of bladder infections in humans varies
significantly according to age and sex. The male/female
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 991CystitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 991"
"ratio of UTIs in children younger than 12 months is 4:1
because of the high rate of birth defects in the urinary
tract of male infants. In adult life, the male/female ratio ofUTIs is 1:50. After age 50, however, the incidence amongmales increases due to prostate disorders.
Cystitis in women
Cystitis is a common female problem. It is estimated
that 50% of adult women experience at least one episodeof dysuria (painful urination); half of these patients havea bacterial UTI. Between 2–5% of women’s visits to pri-mary care doctors are for UTI symptoms. About 90% ofUTIs in women are uncomplicated but recurrent.
Cystitis in men
UTIs are uncommon in younger and middle-aged
men, but may occur as complications of bacterial infec-tions of the kidney or prostate gland.
Cystitis in children
In children, cystitis is often caused by congenital
abnormalities (present at birth) of the urinary tract. Vesi-

"coureteral reflux is a condition in which the child can-
not completely empty the bladder. It allows urine toremain in or flow backward (reflux) into the partiallyempty bladder.
Causes and symptoms
The causes of cystitis vary according to sex because of
the differences in anatomical structure of the urinary tract.
Females
Most bladder infections in women are so-called
ascending infections, which means that they are causedby disease agents traveling upward through the urethra tothe bladder. The relative shortness of the female urethra(1.2–2 in in length) makes it easy for bacteria to gainentry to the bladder and multiply. The most common bac-teria associated with UTIs in women include Escherichia
coli(about 80% of cases), Staphylococcus saprophyticus ,
Klebsiella ,Enterobacter , and Proteus species. Risk fac-
tors for UTIs in women include:
• Sexual intercourse. The risk of infection increases if the
woman has multiple partners.
• Use of a diaphragm for contraception"
"woman has multiple partners.
• Use of a diaphragm for contraception
• An abnormally short urethra
• Diabetes or chronic dehydration
• The absence of a specific enzyme (fucosyltransferase)
in vaginal secretions. The lack of this enzyme makes iteasier for the vagina to harbor bacteria that cause UTIs.• Inadequate personal hygiene. Bacteria from fecal matter
or vaginal discharges can enter the female urethrabecause its opening is very close to the vagina and anus.
• History of previous UTIs. About 80% of women with
cystitis develop recurrences within two years.
The early symptoms of cystitis in women are
dysuria, or pain on urination; urgency, or a sudden
strong desire to urinate; and increased frequency of uri-nation. About 50% of female patients experience fever ,
pain in the lower back or flanks, nausea and vomiting ,
or shaking chills. These symptoms indicate pyelonephri-tis, or spread of the infection to the upper urinary tract.

urine and are often persistent infections caused by drug-resistant organisms. UTIs in men are most likely to becaused by E. coli or another gram-negative bacterium. S.
saprophyticus , which is the second most common cause
of UTIs in women, rarely causes infections in men. Riskfactors for UTIs in men include:
• Lack of circumcision . The foreskin can harbor bacteria
that cause UTIs.
• Urinary catheterization. The longer the period of
catheterization, the higher the risk of UTIs.
The symptoms of cystitis and pyelonephritis in men
are the same as in women.
Hemorrhagic cystitis
Hemorrhagic cystitis, which is marked by large
quantities of blood in the urine, is caused by an acutebacterial infection of the bladder. In some cases, hemor-rhagic cystitis is a side effect of radiation therapy or"
"treatment with cyclophosphamide. Hemorrhagic cystitisin children is associated with adenovirus type 11.
Diagnosis
When cystitis is suspected, the doctor will first
examine the patient’s abdomen and lower back, to evalu-ate unusual enlargements of the kidneys or swelling ofthe bladder. In small children, the doctor will check forfever, abdominal masses, and a swollen bladder.
The next step in diagnosis is collection of a urine
sample. The procedure differs somewhat for women andmen. Laboratory testing of urine samples can now beperformed with dipsticks that indicate immune systemresponses to infection, as well as with microscopicanalysis of samples. Normal human urine is sterile. The

"presence of bacteria or pus in the urine usually indicates
infection. The presence of hematuria, or blood in theurine, may indicate acute UTIs, kidney disease, kidneystones, inflammation of the prostate (in men),endometriosis (in women), or cancer of the urinary
tract. In some cases, blood in the urine results from ath-letic training, particularly in runners.
Females
Female patients require a pelvic examination as part
of the procedure to obtain urine specimens. The patientlies on an obstetrical table with legs in the stirrups. Thedoctor first takes a vaginal culture smear. The patient isthen asked to void while lying on the table. The first5–10 ml are collected to test for urethral infection. Amidstream urine sample of 200 ml is then collected totest for bladder infection.
In women, a vaginal bacterial count that is higher"
"In women, a vaginal bacterial count that is higher
than those of the two urine samples indicates vaginitis. Ahigh bacterial count in the first urine sample indicatesurethritis. A count of more than 104 bacteria CFU/ml(colony forming units per milliliter) in the midstreamsample indicates a bladder or kidney infection. A colonyis a large number of microorganisms that grow from asingle cell within a substance called a culture. A bacterialcount can be given in CFU (colony forming units).
Males
In male patients, the doctor will cleanse the opening
to the urethra with an antiseptic before collecting theurine sample. The first 10 ml of specimen are collectedseparately. The patient then voids a midstream sample of200 ml. Following the second sample, the doctor willmassage the patient’s prostate and collect several dropsof prostatic fluid. The patient then voids a third urinespecimen for prostatic culture.

"A high bacterial count in the first urine specimen or
the prostatic specimens indicates urethritis or prostateinfections respectively. A bacterial count greater than100,000 bacteria CFU/ml in the midstream sample sug-gests a bladder or kidney infection.
Other tests
Women with recurrent UTIs can be given ultrasound
tests of the kidneys and bladder together with a voidingcystourethrogram to test for structural abnormalities. (Acystourethrogram is an x-ray test in which an iodine dyeis used to better view the urinary bladder and urethra.)V oiding cystourethrograms are also used to evaluate chil-dren with UTIs. In some cases, computed tomography
scans (CT scans) can be used to evaluate patients for
possible cancers in the urinary tract.KEY TERMS

Treatment
Medications
Uncomplicated cystitis is treated with antibiotics .
These include penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin;sulfisoxazole or sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim;nitrofurantoin; cephalosporins ; or fluoroquinolones .
(Flouroquinolones are generally not used in childrenunder 18 years of age.) Treatment for women is short-term; most patients respond within three days. Men donot respond as well to short-term treatment andrequire seven to 10 days of oral antibiotics for uncom-plicated UTIs.
Patients of either sex may be given phenazopyridine
or flavoxate to relieve painful urination.

Over 50% of older men with UTIs also suffer
from infection of the prostate gland. Some antibiotics,including amoxicillin and the cephalosporins, do notaffect the prostate gland. Fluoroquinolone antibioticsor trimethoprim are the drugs of choice for thesepatients.
Patients with pyelonephritis can be treated with oral
antibiotics or intramuscular doses of cephalosporins.Medications are given for 10–14 days, and sometimeslonger. If the patient requires hospitalization because ofhigh fever and dehydration caused by vomiting, antibi-otics can be given intravenously.
Surgery
A minority of women with complicated UTIs may
require surgical treatment to prevent recurrent infections.Surgery is also used to treat reflux problems (movementof the urine backwards) or other structural abnormalitiesin children and anatomical abnormalities in adult males.

"Alternative treatment
Alternative treatment for cystitis may emphasize elim-
inating all sugar from the diet and drinking lots of water.Drinking unsweetened cranberry juice not only adds fluid,but is also thought to help prevent cystitis by making itmore difficult for bacteria to cling to the bladder wall. Avariety of herbal therapies are also recommended. General-ly, the recommended herbs are antimicrobials, such as gar-lic (Allium sativum ), goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ),
and bearberry ( Arctostaphylos uva-ursi ), and/or demul-
cents that soothe and coat the urinary tract, including cornsilk and marsh mallow ( Althaea officinalis ).
Homeopathic medicine can also be effective in treat-
ing cystitis. Choosing the correct remedy based on theindividual’s symptoms is always key to the success ofthis type of treatment. Acupuncture and Chinese tradi-
tional herbal medicine can also be helpful in treatingacute and chronic cases of cystitis.

Females
The prognosis for recovery from uncomplicated cys-

Prevention
Females
Women with two or more UTIs within a six-month
period are sometimes given prophylactic treatment, usu-ally nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim for three to sixmonths. In some cases the patient is advised to take anantibiotic tablet following sexual intercourse.
Other preventive measures for women include:

Cystometry is a test of bladder function in which
pressure and volume of fluid in the bladder is measuredduring filling, storage, and voiding.

"Purpose
The urinary bladder stores urine produced by the kid-
neys. The main muscle of the bladder wall, the detrusor,relaxes to allow expansion of the bladder during filling.The urethra, the tube through which urine exits, is heldclosed by a ring of muscle, known as the urethral sphinc-ter. As volume increases, stretching of the detrusor andpressure on the sphincter sends signals to the brain, indi-cating the need for urination, or voiding. V oluntary relax-ation of the sphincter and automatic contractions of thedetrusor allow successful and virtually complete voiding.
A cystometry study is performed to diagnose prob-
lems with urination, including incontinence, urinaryretention, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Urinarydifficulties may occur because of weak or hyperactivesphincter or detrusor, or incoordination of their two

"activities. Infection of the bladder or urethra may cause
incontinence, as can obstruction of the urethra from scartissue, prostate enlargement, or other benign or cancer-ous growths. Loss of sensation due to nerve damage canlead to chronic overfilling.
Precautions
The mild irritation of the urinary tract necessary for
insertion of the catheter may occasionally cause flushing,sweating, and nausea.
Description
The patient begins by emptying the bladder as much
as possible. A thin plastic catheter is then slowly insertedinto the urethra until it reaches the bladder. Measure-ments are taken of the residual urine volume and bladderpressure. Pressure measurements may require a rectalprobe to account for the contribution of the abdominalmuscles to the pressure recording.

"The bladder is then gradually filled with either warm
water, room temperature water, saline solution, carbon diox-ide gas, or a contrast solution for x-ray analysis, dependingon the type of study being done. The patient is asked todescribe sensations during filling, including temperaturesensations and when the first feeling of bladder fullnessoccurs. Once the bladder is completely full, the patient isasked to begin voiding, and measurements are again madeof pressure and volume, as well as flow rate and pressure.
Preparation
There is no special preparation needed for this test.
The patient may be asked to stop taking certain medica-tions in advance of the test, including sedatives, choliner-gics, and anticholinergics.

"Aftercare
Cystometry can be somewhat uncomfortable. The
patient may wish to reserve an hour or so afterward torecover. Urinary frequency or urgency, and some redden-ing of the urine, may last for a day. Increasing fluid intakehelps to flush out the bladder, but caffeinated, carbonated,or alcoholic beverages are discouraged, because they mayirritate the bladder lining. Signs of infection, such asfever , chills, low back pain , or persistent blood in the
urine, should be reported to the examining physician.
Risks
There is a slight risk of infection due to tearing of
the urethral lining.KEY TERMS
Detrusor —Muscle of the bladder wall.
Sphincter —Ring of muscle between the bladder
and the urethra that functions to close off the ure-thra.
Urethra —Tube that empties urine from the blad-
der to the exterior of the body.

"der to the exterior of the body.
Normal results
The normal bladder should not begin contractions
during filling and should initially expand without resis-tance. A feeling of fullness occurs with a volume of100–200 ml. The adult bladder capacity is 300–500 ml.The sphincter should relax and open when the patientwills it, accompanied by detrusor contractions. Duringvoiding, detrusor contraction should be smooth and leadto a steady urine stream.
Abnormal results
Inability of the bladder to relax during filling, or low
bladder volume, may indicate interstitial cystitis , prostate
enlargement, or bladder cancer . Contraction of the blad-
der during filling may be due to irritation from infectionor cysts, obstruction of the bladder outlet, or neurologicaldisease such as stroke ,multiple sclerosis , or spinal cord
injury . Diminished sensation may occur with nerve
lesions, peripheral neuropathy , or chronic overfilling.

Cystoscopy
Definition
Cystoscopy (cystourethroscopy) is a diagnostic pro-
cedure that is used to look at the bladder (lower urinary

"tract), collect urine samples, and examine the prostate
gland. Performed with an optic instrument known as acystoscope (urethroscope), this instrument uses a lightedtip for guidance to aid in diagnosing urinary tract diseaseand prostate disease. Performed by a urologist, this surgi-cal test also enables biopsies to be taken or small stonesto be removed by way of a hollow channel in the cysto-scope.
Purpose
Categorized as an endoscopic procedure, cystoscopy
is used by urologists to examine the entire bladder liningand take biopsies of any areas that look questionable. Thistest is not used on a routine basis, but may benefit the urol-ogist who is needing further information about a patientwho displays the following symptoms or diagnosis:
• blood in the urine (also known as hematuria)
• incontinence or the inabililty to control urination
• a urinary tract infection• a urinary tract which display signs of congenital abnor-
malities
• tumors located in the bladder"
"malities
• tumors located in the bladder
• the presence of bladder or kidney stones
• a stiffness or strained feeling of the urethra or ureters
• symptoms of an enlarged prostate
Blood and urine studies, in addition to x rays of the
kidneys, ureters, and bladder, may all occur before a cys-toscopy. At the time of surgery, a retrograde pyelogrammay also be performed. Additional blood studies may beneeded immediately following surgery.
Precautions
While the cystoscopy procedure is commonly relied
upon to gather additional diagnostic information, it is aninvasive surgical technique that may involve risks for certainpatients. Those who are extremely overweight (obese),smoke, are recovering from a recent illness, or are treating achronic condition may face additional risks from surgery.
Surgical risk also increases in patients who are cur-
rently using certain drugs including antihypertensives;muscle relaxants ; tranquilizers; sleep inducers; insulin;"
"sedatives; beta blockers ; or cortisone. Those who use
mind-altering drugs also put themselves at increased risk ofcomplications during surgery. The following mind-alteringdrugs should be avoided: narcotics; psychedelics; hallu-cinogens; marijuana; sedatives; hypnotics; or cocaine .
Description
Depending on the type of information needed from a
cystoscopy, the procedure typically takes 10–40 minutesto complete. The patient will be asked to urinate beforesurgery which allows an accurate measurement of theremaining urine in the bladder. A well lubricated cysto-scope is inserted through the urethra into the bladderwhere a urine sample is taken. Fluid is then pushed in toinflate the bladder and allow the urologist to examine theentire bladder wall.

Aftercare
Patients who have undergone a cystoscopy will be
instructed to follow these steps to ensure a quick recovery:
• due to soreness or discomfort that may occur in the ure-
thra, especially while urinating, several warm baths aday are recommended to relieve any pain
• allow four days for recovery
• blood may appear in the urine—this is common, and soon
clears up in one to two days following the procedure
• avoid strenuous exercise for a minimum of two weeks
following surgery
• sexual relations may continue when the urologist deter-
mines that healing is complete
• wait at least two days after surgery before driving
Patients may also be prescribed pain relievers and
antibiotics following surgery. Minor pain may also be"
"antibiotics following surgery. Minor pain may also be
treated with over-the-counter, non-prescription drugssuch as acetaminophen .
Risks
As with any surgical procedure, there are some risks
involved with a cystoscopy. Complications may include:profuse bleeding; a damaged urethra; a perforated blad-der; a urinary tract infection; or an injured penis.Patients should also contact their physician if they
experience any of the following symptoms followingsurgery: pain, redness, swelling, drainage, or bleedingfrom the surgical site; signs of infection that may includeheadache , muscle aches, dizziness or an overall ill feel-
ing and fever ; nausea or vomiting; strenuous or painful
urination; or symptoms that may result as side-effectsfrom the medication.

"Epstein-Barr virus. Antibody screening distinguishesbetween these two infections.
Description
When first exposed to CMV , a person’s immune sys-
tem is triggered and quickly makes antibodies to fight thevirus. Antibodies are special proteins designed to attackand destroy foreign material, in this case, the cytomega-lovirus.
The test combines a person’s serum with a substance
to which CMV antibodies attach. This antibody-antigencomplex is measured and the amount of original anti-body determined. If positive for antibodies, the serum isdiluted, or titered, and the test repeated until the serum isso dilute it no longer gives a positive result. The last dilu-tion that gives a positive result is the titer reported.

In fact, reac-tivation of such hidden (or latent) infection is not at alluncommon and usually occurs without symptoms.

"Transplant patients and people with weakened
immune systems, including those with HIV, are vulnera-ble to infection from several routes, including fromanother person, from a donated organ or transfusedblood, or from reactivation of a past infection. Beforetransplant, both the recipient and donor are usually testedfor antibodies. A recipient who has never had CMV (neg-ative for antibodies), should not receive an organ from adonor who has had CMV (positive for antibodies). CVMinfection can be associated with organ rejection, or cancause illness such as pneumonia , hepatitis, or death .
Similarly, blood is usually screened for CMV antibodiesbefore being transfused into a person with a weakenedimmune system.

infection (existing at birth). The infection, passed frommother to baby, can cause permanent mental or physicaldamage, or death. The antibody screening test tells a"

"woman whether or not she has antibody protection
against the virus in case she is exposed during preg-
nancy .
Tests that measure a specific type of antibody help
tell the difference between a current and a past infection.Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies appear at thebeginning of an infection and last only weeks.Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies appear 10–14 dayslater and can last a lifetime. A person suspected of hav-ing a current infection should be tested at the beginningof the infection and again 10–14 days later.
The CMV antibody screening test is also called the
transplant reaction screening test. Results are usuallyavailable the following day.
Preparation
This test requires 5 mL of blood. Collection of the
sample takes only a few minutes.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to thepuncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.Warm packs to the puncture site relieve discomfort.
Normal results"
"Normal results
A person without previous exposure to CMV will
test negative.
Abnormal results
The presence of antibodies means the person has
been infected with CMV , either now or in the past. Anantibody titer at least four times higher at the end of theillness than at the beginning, or the presence of IgM anti-bodies, indicates a recent or current first time infection.
People with weak immune systems may not gener-
ate antibodies against CMV . A current infection in atransplant patient or a person with HIV is confirmed withother tests, such as viral culture.

Cytomegalovirus infection
Definition
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus related to the
group of herpes viruses. Infection with CMV can causeno symptoms, or can be the source of serious illness inpeople with weak immune systems. CMV infection isalso an important cause of birth defects .
Description
CMV is an extremely common organism worldwide."
"Description
CMV is an extremely common organism worldwide.
It is believed that about 85% of the adult population in theUnited States have been infected by CMV at some pointin their lives. CMV is found in almost all of the body’sorgans. It is also found in body fluids, including semen,saliva, urine, feces, breast milk, blood, and secretions ofthe cervix (the narrow, lower section of the uterus).
CMV is also able to cross the placenta (the organ
that provides oxygen and nutrients to the unborn baby inthe uterus). Because CMV can cross the placental barri-er, initial infection in a pregnant woman can lead toinfection of the developing baby.
Causes and symptoms
CMV is passed between people through contact with
body fluids. CMV can also be passed on through sexual
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 999Cytomegalovirus infectionGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 999"
"contact. Babies can be born infected with CMV , either
becoming infected in the uterus (congenital infection) orduring birth (from infected cervical secretions).
Like other herpes viruses, CMV remains inactive
(dormant) within the body for life after the initial infec-tion. Some of the more serious types of CMV infectionsoccur in people who have been harboring the dormantvirus, only to have it reactivate when their immune sys-tem is stressed. Immune systems may be weakenedbecause of cancer chemotherapy , medications given
after organ transplantation, or diseases that significantlylower immune resistance like acquired immunodeficien-
cysyndrome ( AIDS ).
In a healthy person, initial CMV infection often
occurs without symptoms and is rarely noticed. Occa-sionally, a first-time infection with CMV may cause amild illness called mononucleosis. Symptoms includeswollen glands, liver, and spleen; fever ; increased white
blood cells; headache ; fatigue ; and sore throat . About"
"blood cells; headache ; fatigue ; and sore throat . About
8% of all mononucleosis cases are due to CMV infec-tion. A similar infection, though slightly more serious,may occur two to four weeks after receiving a bloodtransfusion containing CMV .
In people with weakened immune systems, CMV
infection can cause more serious and potentially life-threatening illnesses. These illnesses include pneumo-
nia, and inflammations of the liver (hepatitis), brain
(encephalitis ), esophagus (esophagitis), large intestine
(colitis), and retina of the eye (retinitis).
Babies who contract CMV from their mothers dur-
ing birth rarely develop any illness from these infections.Infants born prematurely who become CMV infectedduring birth have a greater chance of complications,including pneumonia, hepatitis, and decreased blood
platelets.
However, an unborn baby is at great risk for seri-"
"platelets.
However, an unborn baby is at great risk for seri-
ous problems when the mother becomes infected withCMV for the first time while pregnant. About 10% ofthese babies will be born with obvious problems,including prematurity , lung problems, an enlarged
liver and spleen, jaundice , anemia, low birth weight,
small head size, and inflammation of the retina. About90% of these babies may appear perfectly normal atbirth. Unfortunately, about 20% of these babies willlater develop severe hearing impairments and mental
retardation .
Diagnosis
Body fluids or tissues can be tested to reveal CMV
infection. However, this information is not always partic-ularly helpful because CMV stays dormant in the cellsfor life. Tests to look for special immune cells (antibod-ies) directed specifically against CMV are useful in prov-ing that a person has been infected with CMV . However,these tests do not give any information regarding whenthe CMV infection first occurred.
Treatment"
"Treatment
Ganciclovir and foscarnet are both antiviral med-

As of 1998, researchis still being done to try to find useful drugs to treatnewborn babies suffering from congenital infectionwith CMV . Antiviral drugs are not used to treat
CMV infection in otherwise healthy patients becausethe drugs have significant side effects that outweightheir benefits.
Prognosis
Prognosis in healthy people with CMV infection
is excellent. About 0.1% of all newborn babies willhave serious damage from CMV infection occurringwhile they were developing in the uterus. About 50%of all transplant patients will develop severe illnessesdue to reactivation of dormant CMV infection. Theseillnesses have a high rate of serious complicationsand death .

Dacryocystitis
Definition
Dacryocystitis is an inflammation of the tear sac
(lacrimal sac) at the inner corner of the eye.
Description
Tears drain into little openings (puncta) in the inner
corners of the eyelids. From there, the tears travelthrough little tube-like structures (canaliculi) to thelacrimal sac. The nasolacrimal ducts then take the tearsfrom the lacrimal sac to the nose. That’s why peopleneed to blow their nose when they cry a lot.
Dacryocystitis is usually caused by a blockage of
the nasolacrimal duct, which allows fluid to drain intothe nasal passages. When the lacrimal sac does notdrain, bacteria can grow in the trapped fluid. This con-dition is most common in infants and people over 40years old.

"Causes and symptoms
In newborn infants, the nasolacrimal duct may fail to
form an opening—a condition called dacryostenosis. Thecause of dacryocystitis in adults is usually associatedwith inflammation and infection in the nasal region.Dacryocystitis can be acute, having a sudden onset, or itcan be chronic, with symptoms occurring over the courseof weeks or months. Symptoms of acute dacryocystitiscan include pain , redness, tearing, and swelling at the
inner corner of the eye by the nose. In chronic dacryocys-titis, the eye area may be swollen, watery or teary, and,when pressure is applied to the area, there may be a dis-charge of pus or mucus through the punctum.Diagnosis

"Dacryocystitis usually occurs in only one eye. As
mentioned, the symptoms can range from watery eyes,pain, swelling, and redness to a discharge of pus whenpressure is applied to the area between the bridge of thenose and the inner eyelids. A sample of the pus may becollected on a swab or in a tube for laboratory analysis.The type of antibiotic and treatment may depend onwhich bacteria is present. In the acute form, a blood testmay reveal an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count;with a chronic infection, the WBC count is usually nor-mal. To identify the exact location of the blockage, an xray can be taken after a dye is injected into the duct in aprocedure called dacryocystography.D

"Treatment
A warm compress applied to the area can help
relieve pain and promote drainage. Topical and oralantibiotics may be prescribed if an infection is present.
Intravenous antibiotics may be needed if the infection issevere. In some cases, a tiny tube (cannula) is insertedinto the tear duct which is then flushed with a sterile saltwater solution (sterile saline). If other treatments fail toclear up the symptoms, surgery (dacryocystorhinostomy)to drain the lacrimal sac into the nasal cavity can be per-formed. In extreme cases, the lacrimal sac will beremoved completely.
In infants, gentle massage of the lacrimal sac four
times daily for up to nine months can drain the sac andsometimes clear a blockage. As the infant grows, the ductmay open by itself. If the duct does not open, it may needto be dilated with a minor surgical procedure.

"Prognosis
Treatment of dacryocystitis with antibiotics is usual-
ly successful in clearing the infection that is present. Ifthere is a permanent blockage that prevents drainage,infection may recur and surgery may be required to openthe duct. If left untreated, the infected sac can rupture,forming an open, draining sore.KEY TERMS

Death
Definition
Death is defined as the cessation of all vital func-
tions of the body including the heartbeat, brain activity(including the brain stem), and breathing.
Description
Death comes in many forms, whether it be expected
after a diagnosis of terminal illness or an unexpectedaccident or medical condition.
Terminal illness
When a terminal illness is diagnosed, a person, fam-
ily, friends, and physicians are all able to prepare for theimpending death. A terminally ill individual goesthrough several levels of emotional acceptance while inthe process of dying. First, there is denial and isolation .
This is followed by anger and resentment. Thirdly, a per-son tries to escape the inevitable. With the realizationthat death is eminent, most people suffer from depres-sion. Lastly, the reality of death is realized and accepted.

"Causes and symptoms
As of 2001, the two leading causes of death for both
men and women in the United States were heart diseaseand cancer . Accidental death was a distant third fol-
lowed by such problems as stroke , chronic lung disor-
ders, pneumonia , suicide, cirrhosis ,diabetes mellitus ,
and murder. The order of these causes of death variesamong persons of different age, ethnicity, and gender.
Diagnosis
In an age of organ transplantation, identifying the
moment of death may now involve another life. It there-by takes on supreme legal importance. It is largely due tothe need for transplant organs that death has been so pre-cisely defined.
The official signs of death include the following:
• no pupil reaction to light
• no response of the eyes to caloric (warm or cold) stimu-
lation
• no jaw reflex (the jaw will react like the knee if hit with
a reflex hammer)
• no gag reflex (touching the back of the throat induces
vomiting)
• no response to pain
• no breathing"
"vomiting)
• no response to pain
• no breathing
• a body temperature above 86°F (30°C), which elimi-
nates the possibility of resuscitation following cold-water drowning
• no other cause for the above, such as a head injury
• no drugs present in the body that could cause apparent
death
• all of the above for 12 hours
• all of the above for six hours and a flat-line electroen-
cephalogram (brain wave study)
• no blood circulating to the brain, as demonstrated by
angiography
Current ability to resuscitate people who have
“died” has produced some remarkable stories. Drowningin cold water (under 50°F/10°C) so effectively slowsmetabolism that some persons have been revived after ahalf hour under water.

One of the most difficult issues surrounding death
in the era of technology is that there is now a choice, notof the event itself, but of its timing. When to die, andmore often, when to let a loved one die, is coming with-in people’s power to determine. This is both a blessingand a dilemma. Insofar as the decision can be made

dilemma. By outlining the conditions under which onewould rather be allowed to die, a person can contributesignificantly to that final decision, even if not competentto do so at the time of actual death. The problem is thatthere are uncertainties surrounding every severely illperson. Each instance presents a greater or lesser chanceof survival. The chance is often greater than zero. Thebest living will follows an intimate discussion with deci-sion makers covering the many possible scenarios sur-rounding the end of life. This discussion is difficult, forfew people like to contemplate their own demise. How-ever, the benefits of a living will are substantial, both tophysicians and to loved ones who are faced with makingfinal decisions.

Euthanasia
Another issue that has received much attention is
assisted suicide (euthanasia). In 1997, the State of Ore-gon placed the issue on the ballot, amid much consterna-tion and dispute. Perhaps the main reason euthanasia hasbecome front page news is because Dr. Jack Kevorkian, apathologist from Michigan, is one of its most vocal advo-cates. The issue highlights the many new problems gen-erated by increasing ability to intervene effectively in thefinal moments of life and unnaturally prolong the processof dying. The public appearance of euthanasia has alsostimulated discussion about more compassionate care ofthe dying.KEY TERMS

Debridement
Definition
Debridement is the process of removing non-living
tissue from pressure ulcers, burns , and other wounds .
Purpose
Debridement speeds the healing of pressure ulcers,"
"Purpose
Debridement speeds the healing of pressure ulcers,
burns, and other wounds. Wounds that contain non-living(necrotic) tissue take longer to heal. The necrotic tissuemay become colonized with bacteria, producing anunpleasant odor. Though the wound is not necessarilyinfected, the bacteria can cause inflammation and strainthe body’s ability to fight infection. Necrotic tissue mayalso hide pockets of pus called abscesses. Abscesses candevelop into a general infection that may lead to ampu-
tation or death .
Precautions
Not all wounds need debridement. Sometimes it is
better to leave a hardened crust of dead tissue, called aneschar, than to remove it and create an open wound, partic-ularly if the crust is stable and the wound is not inflamed.Before performing debridement, the physician will take amedical history with attention to factors that might com-plicate healing, such as medications being taken andsmoking . The physician will also note the cause of the"
"wound and the ways it has been treated. Some ulcers andother wounds occur in places where blood flow isimpaired, for example, the foot ulcers that can accompanydiabetes mellitus . In such cases, the physician or nursemay decide not to debride the wound because blood flow
may be insufficient for proper healing.
Description
In debridement, dead tissue is removed so that the
remaining living tissue can adequately heal. Dead tissueexposed to the air will form a hard black crust, called aneschar. Deeper tissue will remain moist and may appearwhite, or yellow and soft, or flimsy. The four majordebridement techniques are surgical, mechanical, chemi-cal, and autolytic.
Surgical debridement

"Surgical debridement
Surgical debridement (also known as sharp debride-
ment) uses a scalpel, scissors, or other instrument to cutdead tissue from a wound. It is the quickest and mostefficient method of debridement. It is the preferredmethod if there is rapidly developing inflammation of thebody’s connective tissues ( cellulitis ) or a more general-
ized infection ( sepsis ) that has entered the bloodstream.
The procedure can be performed at a patient’s bedside. Ifthe target tissue is deep or close to another organ, howev-er, or if the patient is experiencing extreme pain , the pro-
cedure may be done in an operating room. Surgicaldebridement is generally performed by a physician, butin some areas of the country an advance practice nurse orphysician assistant may perform the procedure.
The physician will begin by flushing the area with a"
"The physician will begin by flushing the area with a
saline (salt water) solution, and then will apply a topicalanesthetic gel to the edges of the wound to minimizepain. Using a forceps to grip the dead tissue, the physi-cian will cut it away bit by bit with a scalpel or scissors.Sometimes it is necessary to leave some dead tissuebehind rather than disturb living tissue. The physicianmay repeat the process again at another session.
Mechanical debridement
In mechanical debridement, a saline-moistened
dressing is allowed to dry overnight and adhere to thedead tissue. When the dressing is removed, the dead tis-sue is pulled away too. This process is one of the oldestmethods of debridement. It can be very painful becausethe dressing can adhere to living as well as nonliving tis-sue. Because mechanical debridement cannot selectbetween good and bad tissue, it is an unacceptabledebridement method for clean wounds where a new layerof healing cells is already developing.
Chemical debridement"
"Chemical debridement
Chemical debridement makes use of certain enzymes
and other compounds to dissolve necrotic tissue. It is more
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1007Debridement"
"selective than mechanical debridement. In fact, the body
makes its own enzyme, collagenase, to break down colla-gen, one of the major building blocks of skin. A pharma-ceutical version of collagenase is available and is highlyeffective as a debridement agent. As with other debride-ment techniques, the area first is flushed with saline. Anycrust of dead tissue is etched in a cross-hatched pattern toallow the enzyme to penetrate. A topical antibiotic is alsoapplied to prevent introducing infection into the blood-stream. A moist dressing is then placed over the wound.
Autolytic debridement

"Autolytic debridement
Autolytic debridement takes advantage of the body’s
own ability to dissolve dead tissue. The key to the tech-nique is keeping the wound moist, which can be accom-plished with a variety of dressings. These dressings helpto trap wound fluid that contains growth factors, enzymes,and immune cells that promote wound healing. Autolyticdebridement is more selective than any other debridementmethod, but it also takes the longest to work. It is inappro-priate for wounds that have become infected.
Preparation
The physician or nurse will begin by assessing the
need for debridement. The wound will be examined, fre-quently by inserting a gloved finger into the wound toestimate the depth of dead tissue and evaluate whether itlies close to other organs, bone, or important body fea-tures. The area may be flushed with a saline solutionbefore debridement begins, and a topical anesthetic gelor injection may be applied if surgical or mechanicaldebridement is being performed."
"Aftercare
After surgical debridement, the wound will be
packed with a dry dressing for a day to control bleeding.KEY TERMS

"Risks
It is possible that underlying tendons, blood vessels
or other structures will be damaged during the examina-tion of the wound and during surgical debridement. Sur-face bacteria may also be introduced deeper into thebody, causing infection.
Normal results
Removal of dead tissue from pressure ulcers and other
wounds speeds healing. Although these procedures causesome pain, they are generally well tolerated by patients andcan be managed more aggressively. It is not uncommon todebride a wound again in a subsequent session.

Decompression sickness
Definition
Decompression sickness (DCS) is a dangerous and
occasionally lethal condition caused by nitrogen bubblesthat form in the blood and other tissues of scuba diverswho surface too quickly.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1008Decompression sickness"
"Description
According to the Divers Alert Network (DAN), a
worldwide organization devoted to safe-diving researchand promotion, less than 1% of divers fall victim to DCSor the rarer bubble problem called gas embolism , air
embolism , or arterial gas embolism (AGE). A study of the
United States military community in Okinawa, where tensof thousands of sport and military dives are made eachyear, identified 84 DCS and 10 AGE cases in 1989–95,including nine deaths. This translated into estimates of onecase in every 7,400 dives and one death in every 76,900
dives. DCS symptoms can be quite mild, however, andmany cases certainly go unnoticed by divers.
At times the terminology adopted by writers on"
"At times the terminology adopted by writers on
DCS can be confusing. Some substitute the termdecompression illness (DCI) for DCS. Others treat DCIas a label encompassing both DCS and AGE. An olderterm for DCS is caisson disease, coined in the nine-teenth century when it was discovered that bridge con-struction crews working at the bottom of lakes andrivers in large pressurized enclosures (caissons) wereexperiencing joint pain (a typical DCS symptom) on
returning to the surface.
Causes and symptoms
The air we breathe is mostly a mixture of two gases,"
"nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). Unlike oxygen, nitro-gen is a biologically inert gas, meaning that it is notmetabolized (converted into other substances) by thebody. For this reason, most of the nitrogen we inhale isexpelled when we exhale, but some is dissolved into theblood and other tissues. During a dive, however, thelungs take in more nitrogen than usual. This happensbecause the surrounding water pressure is greater thanthe air pressure at sea level (twice as great at 33 ft [10 m],for instance). As the water pressure increases, so does thepressure of the nitrogen in the compressed air inhaled bythe diver. Because increased pressure causes an increasein gas density, the diver takes in more nitrogen with eachbreath than he or she would at sea level. Instead of beingexhaled, however, the extra nitrogen safely dissolves intothe tissues, where it remains until the diver begins his orher return to the surface (under some circumstances theextra nitrogen can cause nitrogen narcosis ,"
"return to the surface (under some circumstances theextra nitrogen can cause nitrogen narcosis , but that con-"
"dition is distinct from DCS). On the way up, decompres-sion occurs (in other words, the water pressure drops),and with the change in pressure, the extra nitrogen grad-ually diffuses out of the tissues and is delivered by thebloodstream to the lungs, which expel it from the body. Ifthe diver surfaces too quickly, however, potentially dan-gerous nitrogen bubbles can form in the tissues and causeDCS. These bubbles can compress nerves, obstruct arter-ies, veins, and lymphatic vessels, and trigger harmful
chemical reactions in the blood. The precise reasons forbubble formation remain unclear.
How much extra nitrogen enters the tissues varies"
"How much extra nitrogen enters the tissues varies
with the dive’s depth and duration. Dive tables preparedby the U.S. Navy and other organizations specify howlong most divers can safely remain at a particular depth.If the dive table limits are exceeded, the diver must pauseon the way up to allow the nitrogen to diffuse into thebloodstream without forming bubbles; these pauses arecalled decompression stops, and are carefully calibrated.DCS can occur, however, even when a diver obeys safediving rules. In such cases, the predisposing factorsinclude fatigue ,obesity ,dehydration ,hypothermia ,"
"and recent alcohol use. As well, people who fly or travelto high-altitude locations without letting 12–24 hourspass after their last dive are at risk for DCS as wellbecause their bodies undergo further decompression.This is true even when flying in commercial aircraft.Many travelers are unaware that to save money on fuelthe cabin pressure in commercial aircraft is set muchlower than the pressure at sea level. At 30,000 ft (9,144m), for instance, cabin pressure is usually equivalent tothe pressure at 7,000–8,000 ft (2,133–2,438 m) above sealevel, a safe setting for everyone but recent divers. Exact-ly how long a diver should wait before flying or travelingto a high-altitude location depends on how much divinghe or she has done and other considerations. If there isuncertainty about the appropriate waiting period, the sen-sible course of action is to let the full 24 hours pass.

"Because the nitrogen bubbles that cause DCS can
affect any of the body’s tissues, including the blood,bones, nerves, and muscles, many kinds of symptoms arepossible. Symptoms can appear minutes after a diver sur-faces, and in about 80% of cases do so within eighthours. Pain is often the only symptom; this is sometimescalled the bends, although many people incorrectly usethat term as a synonym for DCS itself. The pain, whichranges from mild to severe, is usually limited to thejoints, but can be felt anywhere. Severe itching (pruritis),
skin rashes , and skin mottling (cutis marmorata) are
other possible symptoms. All of these are sometimesclassified as manifestations of type 1 or “mild” DCS.type 2 or “serious” DCS can lead, among other things, toparalysis , brain damage, heart attacks, and death. Many
DCS victims, however, experience both type 1 and type 2symptoms.

"Treatment
DCS is treated by giving the patient oxygen and
placing him or her in a hyperbaric chamber, an enclosurein which the air pressure is first gradually increased andthen gradually decreased. This shrinks the bubbles andallows the nitrogen to safely diffuse out of the tissues.Hyperbaric chamber facilities exist throughout the Unit-ed States. No matter how mild one’s symptoms mayappear, immediate transportation to a facility is essential.Treatment is necessary even if the symptoms clear upbefore the facility is reached, because bubbles may stillbe in the bloodstream and pose a threat.

"Prognosis
DCS sufferers who undergo chamber treatment within
a few hours of symptom onset usually enjoy a full recovery.If treatment is delayed the consequences are less pre-dictable, although many people have been helped even afterseveral days have passed. A 1992 DAN report on divingaccidents indicated that full recovery following chambertreatment was immediate for about 50% of divers. Somepeople, however, suffer numbness, tingling, or other symp-toms that last weeks, months, or even a lifetime. In the Oki-nawa study, six of the 94 patients experienced “long-last-ing” symptoms even after repeated chamber treatments.

Decongestants
Definition
Decongestants are medicines used to relieve nasal
congestion (stuffy nose).
Purpose
A congested or stuffy nose is a common symptom of
colds and allergies . This congestion results when mem-
branes lining the nose become swollen. Decongestantsrelieve the swelling by narrowing the blood vessels thatsupply the nose. This reduces the blood supply to theswollen membranes, causing the membranes to shrink.
These medicines do not cure colds or reverse the
effects of histamines—chemicals released as part of the

"allergic reaction. They will not relieve all of the symptoms
associated with colds and allergies, only the stuffiness.
When considering whether to use a decongestant for
cold symptoms, keep in mind that most colds go awaywith or without treatment and that taking medicine is notthe only way to relieve a stuffy nose. Drinking hot tea orbroth or eating chicken soup may help. There are alsoadhesive strips can be placed on the nose to help widenthe nasal passages, making breathing through the nasalpassages a bit easier when congestion is present.
Precautions
Decongestant nasal sprays and nose drops may
cause a problem called rebound congestion if usedrepeatedly over several days. When this happens, thenose remains stuffy or gets worse with every dose. Theonly way to stop the cycle is to stop using the drug. Thestuffiness should then go away within about a week.Anyone who shows signs of severe rebound congestionshould also contact his or her physician."
"Do not use decongestant nasal sprays for more than
three days. Decongestants taken by mouth should not beused for more than seven days. If the congestion has notgone away in this time, or if the symptoms are accompa-nied by fever , call a physician.
Do not use a decongestant nasal spray after the prod-
uct’s expiration date. If the product has become cloudyor discolored, throw it away and do not use it. Do notshare droppers or spray bottles with anyone else, as thiscould spread infection. Do not let droppers and bottletips touch countertops or other surfaces.
Some decongestants cause drowsiness. People who
takes these drugs should not drive, use machines or doanything else that might be dangerous until they havefound out how the drugs affect them.

"In general, older people may be more sensitive to the
effects of decongestants and may need to take lowerdoses to avoid side effects. People in this age groupshould not take long-acting (extended release) forms ofdecongestants unless they have previously taken a short-acting form with no ill effects.
Children may also be more sensitive to the effects of
decongestants. Before giving any decongestant to achild, check the package label carefully. Some of thesemedicines are too strong for use in children. Serious sideeffects are possible if they are given large amounts ofthese drugs or if they swallow nose drops, nasal spray oreye drops. If this happens, call a physician or poison cen-ter immediately.Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake decongestants. Before taking these drugs, be sure tolet the physician know about any of these conditions:

"ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to decongestants in the past should let his or her physi-cian know before these drugs or any similar drugs areprescribed. The physician should also be told about anyallergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other sub-stances.
PREGNANCY. In studies of laboratory animals, some
decongestants have had unwanted effects on fetuses.However, it is not known whether such effects also occurin people. Women who are pregnant or who plan tobecome pregnant should check with their physiciansbefore taking decongestants.
BREASTFEEDING. Some decongestants pass into
breast milk and may have unwanted effects on nursingbabies whose mothers take the drugs. Women who arebreastfeeding should check with their physicians beforeusing decongestants. If they need to take the medicine, itmay be necessary to bottle feed the baby with formulawhile taking it.

"OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Anyone with heart
or blood vessel disease, high blood pressure, diabetes,enlarged prostate , or overactive thyroid should not take

Before using decongestants, people with any of
these medical problems should make sure their physi-cians are aware of their conditions:

Decongestants are sold in many forms, including
tablets, capsules, caplets, gelcaps, liqui-caps, liquids,nasal sprays, and nose drops. These drugs are sometimescombined with other medicines in cold and allergy prod-ucts designed to relieve several symptoms. Some decon-gestant products require a physician’s prescription, butthere are also many nonprescription (over-the-counter)products. Ask a physician or pharmacist about choosingan appropriate decongestant.
Commonly used decongestants include oxymetazo-
line (Afrin and other brands) and pseudoephedrine(Sudafed, Actifed, and other brands). The decongestantoxymetazoline is also used in some eye drops to relieveredness and itching .

"The recommended dosage depends on the drug.
Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or thepharmacist who filled the prescription for the correctdosage, and always take the medicine exactly as directed.If using nonprescription (over-the-counter) types, followthe directions on the package label or ask a pharmacistfor assistance. Never take larger or more frequent doses,and do not take the drug for longer than directed.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1012Decongestants"
"Risks
Anyone considering taking a decongestant should
take a close look at the labels of any already in their med-icine cabinet. In 2000, the Food and Drug Administrationprohibited over-the-counter sales of medicines contain-ing the decongestant phenylpropanolamine. The medi-cine is associated with an increased risk of stroke in peo-
ple ages 18 to 49, especially women. Many cold reme-dies contained this medicine. Contact a pharmacist ifthere is any question about the ingredients in a medica-tion. Over-the-counter remedies containing phenyl-propanolamine should be discarded.
Normal results
The desired result when taking decongestants is the
short-term relief of nasal congestion.

Deep vein thrombosis is a major complication in
patients who have had orthopedic surgery or pelvic,
abdominal, or thoracic surgery . Patients with cancer
and other chronic illnesses (including congestive heart

Only 23–50% of patientsexperience symptoms, so it’s often “silent.” Some indi-viduals and families have underlying clotting tendenciesthat can be tested for.

Venography identifies the location,extent, and degree of attachment of the blood clots, andenables the condition of the deep leg veins to beassessed. A contrast solution is injected into a foot veinthrough a catheter. The physician observes the move-ment of the solution through the vein with a fluoro-scope while a series of x rays are taken. Venographytakes 30–45 minutes and can be done in a physician’soffice, a laboratory, or a hospital. Radionuclide venog-raphy, in which a radioactive isotope is injected, isoccasionally used, especially if a patient has had reac-tions to contrast solutions.

Thrombosis —The development of a blood clot

Doppler ultrasonography is usually the preferred
procedure for detecting deep vein thrombosis. This tech-nique uses sound waves to measure blood flow throughleg veins and arteries. A blood pressure cuff is wrappedaround the patient’s ankle and a transducer with gel on itis placed over pulse points of the foot and lower leg.High-frequency sounds bounce off the soft tissue, andthe echoes are converted into images on a monitor.

"Alternative treatment
Deep vein thrombosis can be life-threatening and
must be treated with conventional medical therapies.However, there are alternative therapies that can be usedin conjunction with emergency treatments to dissolve theclot that help support the body and prevent recurrence.

Prognosis
In many cases, deep vein thrombosis can be success-
fully treated if diagnosed early.
Prevention
Deep vein thrombosis can be prevented through pro-
phylactic anticoagulant drugs and venous stasis preventionwith gradient elastic stockings and intermittent pneumaticcompression of the legs. High-risk patients often need toremain on anticoagulants like Coumadin indefinitely.

Defibrillation
Definition
Defibrillation is a process in which an electronic
device sends an electric shock to the heart to stop anextremely rapid, irregular heartbeat, and restore the nor-mal heart rhythm."
"Purpose
Defibrillation is performed to correct life-threaten-
ing fibrillations of the heart, which could result in car-diac arrest. It should be performed immediately afteridentifying that the patient is experiencing a cardiacemergency, has no pulse, and is unresponsive.
Precautions
Defibrillation should not be performed on a patient
who has a pulse or is alert, as this could cause a lethalheart rhythm disturbance or cardiac arrest. The paddlesused in the procedure should not be placed on a woman’sbreasts or over a pacemaker.
Description
Fibrillations cause the heart to stop pumping blood,
leading to brain damage and/or cardiac arrest. About10% of the ability to restart the heart is lost with everyminute that the heart stays in fibrillation. Death can"
"occur in minutes unless the normal heart rhythm isrestored through defibrillation. Because immediatedefibrillation is crucial to the patient’s survival, theAmerican Heart Association has called for the integra-tion of defibrillation into an effective emergency cardiaccare system. The system should include early access,early cardiopulmonary resuscitation , early defibrilla-
tion, and early advanced cardiac care.
Defibrillators deliver a brief electric shock to the"
"tion, and early advanced cardiac care.
Defibrillators deliver a brief electric shock to the
heart, which enables the heart’s natural pacemaker toregain control and establish a normal heart rhythm. Thedefibrillator is an electronic device with electrocardio-gram leads and paddles. During defibrillation, the pad-dles are placed on the patient’s chest, caregivers standback, and the electric shock is delivered. The patient’spulse and heart rhythm are continually monitored. Med-ications to treat possible causes of the abnormal heartrhythm may be administered. Defibrillation continuesuntil the patient’s condition stabilizes or the procedure isordered to be discontinued.
Early defibrillators, about the size and weight of a"
"Early defibrillators, about the size and weight of a
car battery, were used primarily in ambulances and hos-pitals. The American Heart Association now advocatespublic access defibrillation; this calls for placing auto-mated external defibrillators (AEDS) in police vehicles,airplanes, and at public events, etc. The AEDS are small-er, lighter, less expensive, and easier to use than the earlydefibrillators. They are computerized to provide simple,verbal instructions to the operator and to make it impos-sible to deliver a shock to a patient whose heart is not fib-rillating. The placement of AEDs is likely to expand tomany public locations.
Preparation
After help is called for, cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion ( CPR ) is begun and continued until the caregivers
arrive and set up the defibrillator. Electrocardiogram

"leads are attached to the patient’s chest. Gel or paste is
applied to the defibrillator paddles, or two gel pads areplaced on the patient’s chest. The caregivers verify lackof a pulse, and select a charge.
Aftercare
After defibrillation, the patient’s cardiac status, breath-
ing, and vital signs are monitored until he or she is stable.Typically, this monitoring takes place after the patient hasbeen removed to an intensive care or cardiac care unit in ahospital. An electrocardiogram and chest x ray are taken.
The patient’s skin is cleansed to remove gel or paste, and, ifnecessary, ointment is applied to burns . An intravenous
line provides additional medication, as needed.
Risks
Skin burns from the defibrillator paddles are the
most common complication of defibrillation. Other risksinclude injury to the heart muscle, abnormal heartrhythms, and blood clots.

Dehydration
Definition
Dehydration is the loss of water and salts essential
for normal body function.
Description
Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluid
than it takes in. This condition can result from illness; ahot, dry climate; prolonged exposure to sun or high tem-peratures; not drinking enough water; and overuse ofdiuretics or other medications that increase urination.
Dehydration can upset the delicate fluid-salt balanceneeded to maintain healthy cells and tissues.
Water accounts for about 60% of a man’s body"
"Water accounts for about 60% of a man’s body
weight. It represents about 50% of a woman’s weight.Young and middle-aged adults who drink when they’rethirsty do not generally have to do anything more tomaintain their body’s fluid balance. Children need morewater because they expend more energy, but most chil-dren who drink when they are thirsty get as much wateras their systems require.
Age and dehydration
Adults over the age of 60 who drink only when they
are thirsty probably get only about 90% of the fluid theyneed. Developing a habit of drinking only in response tothe body’s thirst signals raises an older person’s risk ofbecoming dehydrated. Seniors who have relocated toareas where the weather is warmer or dryer than the cli-mate they are accustomed to are even likelier to becomedehydrated unless they make it a practice to drink evenwhen they are not thirsty.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1016Dehydration"
"Dehydration in children usually results from losing
large amounts of fluid and not drinking enough water toreplace the loss. This condition generally occurs in chil-dren who have stomach flu characterized by vomitingand diarrhea , or who can not or will not take enough
fluids to compensate for excessive losses associated withfever and sweating of acute illness. An infant can
become dehydrated only hours after becoming ill. Dehy-dration is a major cause of infant illness and death
throughout the world.
Types of dehydration
Mild dehydration is the loss of no more than 5% of
the body’s fluid. Loss of 5–10% is considered moderatedehydration. Severe dehydration (loss of 10–15% ofbody fluids) is a life-threatening condition that requiresimmediate medical care.
Complications of dehydration
When the body’s fluid supply is severely depleted,
hypovolemic shock is likely to occur. This condition,"
"hypovolemic shock is likely to occur. This condition,
which is also called physical collapse, is characterized bypale, cool, clammy skin; rapid heartbeat; and shallowbreathing.
Blood pressure sometimes drops so low it can not be
measured, and skin at the knees and elbows may becomeblotchy. Anxiety , restlessness, and thirst increase. After
the patient’s temperature reaches 107°F (41.7°C) damageto the brain and other vital organs occurs quickly.
Causes and symptoms
Strenuous activity, excessive sweating, high fever,

• nausea
• bacterial or viral infection or inflammation of the phar-

Other conditions that can lead to dehydration include:• disease of the adrenal glands, which regulate the body’s
water and salt balance and the function of many organsystems
• diabetes mellitus• eating disorders
• kidney disease
• chronic lung disease
An infant who does not wet a diaper in an eight-
hour period is dehydrated. The soft spot on the baby’shead (fontanel) may be depressed. Symptoms of dehy-dration at any age include cracked lips, dry or stickymouth, lethargy, and sunken eyes. A person who isdehydrated cries without shedding tears and does noturinate very often. The skin is less elastic than it shouldbe and is slow to return to its normal position afterbeing pinched."
"Dehydration can cause confusion, constipation , dis-
comfort, drowsiness, fever, and thirst. The skin turns paleand cold, the mucous membranes lining the mouth andnose lose their natural moisture. The pulse sometimesraces and breathing becomes rapid. Significant fluid losscan cause serious neurological problems.
Diagnosis
The patient’s symptoms and medical history usual-
ly suggest dehydration. Physical examination may
reveal shock, rapid heart rate, and/or low blood pres-sure. Laboratory tests, including blood tests (to checkelectrolyte levels) and urine tests (e.g., urine specificgravity and creatinine), are used to evaluate the severi-ty of the problem. Other laboratory tests may beordered to determine the underlying condition (such asdiabetes or an adrenal gland disorder) causing thedehydration.

"Treatment
Increased fluid intake and replacement of lost elec-
trolytes are usually sufficient to restore fluid balances inpatients who are mildly or moderately dehydrated. Forindividuals who are mildly dehydrated, just drinkingplain water may be all the treatment that is needed.Adults who need to replace lost electrolytes may drinksports beverages (e.g., Gatorade or Recharge) or con-sume a little additional salt. Parents should follow labelinstructions when giving children Pedialyte or othercommercial products recommended to relieve dehydra-tion. Children who are dehydrated should receive onlyclear fluids for the first 24 hours.
A child who is vomiting should sip one or two tea-
spoons of liquid every 10 minutes. A child who is less

"Children and adults can gradually return to their
normal diet after they have stopped vomiting and nolonger have diarrhea. Bland foods should be reintro-duced first, with other foods added as the digestive sys-tem is able to tolerate them. Milk, ice cream, cheese,and butter should not be eaten until 72 hours after symp-toms have disappeared.
Medical care
Severe dehydration can require hospitalization and
intravenous fluid replacement. If an individual’s bloodpressure drops enough to cause or threaten the develop-ment of shock, medical treatment is usually required. Adoctor should be notified whenever an infant or childexhibits signs of dehydration or a parent is concernedthat a stomach virus or other acute illness may lead todehydration.
A doctor should also be notified if:
• a child less than three months old develops a fever

than 3 lb (1.3 kg) in a day or more than 5 lb (2.3 kg) aweek
When treating dehydration, the underlying cause
must also be addressed. For example, if dehydration iscaused by vomiting or diarrhea, medications may be pre-scribed to resolve these symptoms. Patients who aredehydrated due to diabetes, kidney disease, or adrenalgland disorders must receive treatment for these condi-tions as well as for the resulting dehydration.Alternative treatment

Patients who are vomiting or who have diarrhea
can prevent dehydration by drinking enough fluid fortheir urine to remain the color of pale straw. Ensuringthat patients always drink adequate fluids during an ill-ness will help prevent dehydration.

People who are not ill can maintain properfluid balance by drinking several glasses of waterbefore going outside on a hot day. It is also a good ideato avoid coffee and tea, which increase body tempera-ture and water loss.
Patients should know whether any medication they
are taking can cause dehydration and should get promptmedical care to correct any underlying condition thatincreases the risk of dehydration.

Delayed hypersensitivity 
skin test
Definition
A delayed hypersensitivity test (DHT) is an immune
function test measuring the presence of activated T cellsthat recognize a certain substance.
Purpose
The immune system protects against infection by"
"Purpose
The immune system protects against infection by
viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. After initial expo-sure to a foreign substance, or antigen, the immune sys-tem creates both antibodies and sensitized T cells. Boththese immune agents respond when the body is reex-posed to the antigen. Antibodies, which are circulatingproteins, respond within minutes, to give what is termedan immediate hypersensitivity reaction. T cells’ respons-es occur over several days, and are thus called delayedhypersensitivity reactions. The cascade of events initiat-ed by the T cells leads to hardening (induration) and red-ness (erythema) at the injection site.
A DHT is performed for one of three reasons:
• To test for exposure to specific diseases, such as tuber-
culosis (TB). Tuberculosis testing is done by injecting
into the skin a small volume of TB antigen, which con-tains no organisms (live or dead) but can still provokean immune response."
"• To test for allergic sensitivity to potential skin irritants,
such as poison ivy. Skin allergy testing is usually doneby placing a series of adhesive patches on the skin con-taining potential allergens, or allergy-causing sub-stances.
• To assess the vitality of the T cell response as part of
the evaluation of immune system health in infection,cancer , immune disorders, pre-transplantation screen-
ing, aging , and malnutrition . DHT can help predict
survival in immunocompromised patients, and evalu-ate the success of restorative therapy. Antigens usedfor these tests must be ones the patient has beenexposed to before, and, therefore, include inactivatedantigens from common infectious agents to which thepatient might have been exposed, such as mumps ,
Candida albicans ,tetanus toxoid, and trichophyton (a
skin fungus).

"skin fungus).
Precautions
No special precautions are necessary for most
patients. Those with known hypersensitivity to certainskin irritants should alert the clinician performing thetest. Some commercial preparations of fungal antigenscontain mercury, a source of irritation to somepatients.
Description
The most accurate TB test is the Mantoux test, in
which a small amount of TB antigen is injected intothe skin. The area is examined 48–72 hours after theinjection.
In the patch test, 20–30 adhesive patches are usually
placed on the upper back. The patches are kept in placeand the area is kept dry for 48 hours. The patches arethen removed, and the skin is examined 24 hours after-ward, and possibly again a day or more following that.Patch testing is usually performed following a patientcomplaint of skin irritation from an unknown substance.Testing may suggest several candidates; identifying theright one requires careful review of the patient’s possi-ble exposure."
"The test of overall T cell responsiveness is per-
formed with several injections. Each area injected is cir-cled and marked. Results are read 48 hours after theinjection.
Preparation
No special preparation is necessary.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1019Delayed hypersensitivity skin test"
"Aftercare
Patches should be kept dry. Injection sites may be
washed, but excessive rubbing should be avoided. Patch-es and injection sites may become reddened or irritated.If a patch causes severe itching or discomfort, the patient
should remove it immediately.
Risks
DHT is quite safe for virtually all people. There is
no risk of infection from the agents injected, since theyare purified antigens, not whole organisms. Life threaten-ing, hypersensitive reactions ( anaphylaxis ) are a very
small risk; patients should notify the administeringphysician immediately if signs of wheezing , swelling, or
diffuse redness of the skin develops.
Normal results
Absence of exposure to TB is indicated by absent or
very little skin reaction; redness or hardness smaller than5 mm (about 0.25 in) is considered normal for a personnot exposed or infected with TB.
Patch test sites should be normal or only slightly red.
T cell responsiveness tests should be positive; that is,"
"T cell responsiveness tests should be positive; that is,
the injected areas should be reddened and hard. Two affect-ed areas of 2 mm or more is considered a positive result.
Abnormal results
TB exposure is indicated by a reaction of 10 mm or
more. The degree of redness is not important. A 5–10mm area could indicate exposure if there is an underlyingrisk to TB.
Patch test areas that become reddened and irritated
indicate reaction to the substance in the patch.KEY TERMS

"Description
Delirium is a syndrome, or group of symptoms,
caused by a disturbance in the normal functioning of thebrain. The delirious patient has a reduced awareness ofand responsiveness to the environment, which may bemanifested as disorientation, incoherence, and memorydisturbance. Delirium is often marked by hallucinations ,
delusions , and a dream-like state.
Delirium affects at least one in 10 hospitalized
patients, and is a common part of many terminal illness-es. Delirium is more common in the elderly than in thegeneral population. While it is not a specific diseaseitself, patients with delirium usually fare worse thanthose with the same illness who do not have delirium.

Diagnosis
Delirium is diagnosed through the medical history
and recognition of symptoms during mental status
examination . The most important part of diagnosis is
determining the cause of the delirium. Tests may includeblood and urine analysis for levels of drugs, fluids, elec-trolytes, and blood gases, and to test for infection; lum-bar puncture (“spinal tap”) to test for central nervoussystem infection; x ray, computed tomography scans
(CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to
look for tumors, hemorrhage, or other brain abnormali-ty; thyroid tests; electroencephalography (EEG); elec-
trocardiography (ECG); and possibly others as dictated
by the likely cause.
Treatment

"by the likely cause.
Treatment
Treatment of delirium begins with recognizing and
treating the underlying cause. Delirium itself is managedby reducing disturbing stimuli, or providing soothingones; use of simple, clear language in communication;and reassurance, especially from family members. Physi-cal restraints may be needed if the patient is a danger tohimself or others, or if he insists on removing necessarymedical equipment such as intravenous lines or monitors.Sedatives or antipsychotic drugs may be used to reduce
anxiety, hallucinations, and delusions.
Prognosis
Persons with delirium usually have a worse prog-
nosis for the underlying disease than the person with-out delirium. Nonetheless, those without terminal ill-ness usually recover from delirium. They may not,however, regain all their original cognitive abilities,and may be left with some permanent impairments,including fatigue , irritability, difficulty concentrating,

Prevention
Prevention of delirium is focused on treating or
avoiding its underlying causes. The most preventableforms are those induced by drugs. Strategies for reducingdelirium include following prescriptions, consulting theprescribing physician immediately if symptoms occur,and consulting the physician before discontinuing thedrug, even if it has been ineffective; avoiding intoxica-tion with legal or illegal drugs, and seeking professionalassistance before suddenly discontinuing an addictive
drug such as alcohol or heroin; maintaining good nutri-
tion, which promotes general health and can minimize
the likelihood of delirium from alcohol intoxication andwithdrawal; and avoiding exposure to solvents, insecti-cides, heavy metals, or biological poisons in the home orworkplace.

Delusions
Definition
A delusion is an unshakable belief in something
untrue. These irrational beliefs defy normal reasoning,and remain firm even when overwhelming proof is pre-sented to dispute them. Delusions are often accompaniedby hallucinations and/or feelings of paranoia , which
act to strengthen confidence in the delusion. Delusionsare distinct from culturally or religiously based beliefsthat may be seen as untrue by outsiders.

disorder. Individuals with delusional disorder sufferfrom long-term, complex delusions that fall into one ofsix categories: persecutory, grandiose, jealousy, ero-tomanic, somatic, or mixed. There are also delusionaldisorders such as dementia that clearly have organic or
physical causes.
Persecutory
Individuals with persecutory delusional disorder are
plagued by feelings of paranoia and an irrational yetunshakable belief that someone is plotting against them,or out to harm them.

"Grandiose
Individuals with grandiose delusional disorder have
an over-inflated sense of self-worth. Their delusions cen-ter on their own importance, such as believing that theyhave done or created something of extreme value or havea “special mission.”
Jealousy
Jealous delusions are unjustified and irrational
beliefs that an individual’s spouse or significant other hasbeen unfaithful.
Erotomanic
Individuals with erotomanic delusional disorder
believe that another person, often a stranger, is in lovewith them. The object of their affection is typically of ahigher social status, sometimes a celebrity. This type ofdelusional disorder may lead to stalking or other poten-tially dangerous behavior.
Somatic
Somatic delusions involve the belief that something
is physically wrong with the individual. The delusionmay involve a medical condition or illness or a perceiveddeformity. This condition differs from hypochondriasis"
"in that the deformity is perceived as a fixed condition nota temporary illness.
Mixed
Mixed delusions are those characterized by two or
more of persecutory, grandiose, jealousy, erotomanic, orsomatic themes.
Causes and symptoms
Some studies have indicated that delusions may be
generated by abnormalities in the limbic system, the por-tion of the brain on the inner edge of the cerebral cortexthat is believed to regulate emotions. The exact source ofdelusions has not been conclusively found, but potentialcauses include genetics, neurological abnormalities, andchanges in brain chemistry. Delusions are also a knownpossible side effect of drug use and abuse (e.g., ampheta-mines, cocaine , PCP).
Diagnosis
Patients with delusional symptoms should undergo a
thorough physical examination and patient history to
rule out possible organic causes (such as dementia). If apsychological cause is suspected, a mental health profes-sional will typically conduct an interview with theKEY TERMS"

Treatment
Delusions that are symptomatic of delusional disor-
der should be treated by a psychologist and/or psychia-trist. Though antipsychotic drugs are often not effec-
tive, antipsychotic medication such as thioridazine (Mel-laril), haloperidol (Haldol), chlorpromazine (Thorazine),clozapine (Clozaril), or risperidone (Risperdal) may beprescribed, and cognitive therapy or psychotherapy maybe attempted.

Prognosis
Delusional disorder is typically a chronic condition,
but with appropriate treatment, a remission of delusionalsymptoms occurs in up to 50% of patients. However,because of their strong belief in the reality of their delu-sions and a lack of insight into their condition, individualswith this disorder may never seek treatment, or may beresistant to exploring their condition in psychotherapy.

"Description
Dementia is a group of symptoms caused by gradual
death of brain cells. The loss of cognitive abilities that
occurs with dementia leads to impairments in memory,reasoning, planning, and personality. While the over-whelming number of people with dementia are elderly, itis not an inevitable part of aging . Instead, dementia is
caused by specific brain diseases. Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) is the most common cause, followed by vascular ormulti-infarct dementia.

"The prevalence of dementia has been difficult to
determine, partly because of differences in definitionamong different studies, and partly because there is somenormal decline in functional ability with age. Dementiaaffects 5–8% of all people between ages 65 and 74, andup to 20% of those between 75 and 84. Estimates fordementia in those 85 and over range from 30–47%.Between two and four million Americans have AD; thatnumber is expected to grow to as many as 14 million bythe middle of the twenty-first century as the populationas a whole ages.

"The cost of dementia can be considerable. While
most people with dementia are retired and do not sufferincome losses from their disease, the cost of care is oftenenormous. Financial burdens include lost wages for fam-ily caregivers, medical supplies and drugs, and homemodifications to ensure safety. Nursing home care maycost several thousand dollars a month or more. The psy-chological cost is not as easily quantifiable but can beeven more profound. The person with dementia losescontrol of many of the essential features of his life andpersonality, and loved ones lose a family member even asthey continue to cope with the burdens of increasingdependence and unpredictability.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
Dementia is usually caused by degeneration in the
cerebral cortex, the part of the brain responsible forthoughts, memories, actions and personality. Death ofbrain cells in this region leads to the cognitive impair-ment which characterizes dementia.
The most common cause of dementia is AD,"
"The most common cause of dementia is AD,
accounting for half to three quarters of all cases. Thebrain of a person with AD becomes clogged with twoabnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tangles andsenile plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twisted massesof protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. Senileplaques are composed of parts of neurons surrounding agroup of proteins called beta-amyloid deposits. Whythese structures develop is unknown. Current researchindicates possible roles for inflammation, blood flowrestriction, and toxic molecular fragments known as freeradicals. Several genes have been associated with higherincidences of AD, although the exact role of these genesis still unknown.
Vascular dementia is estimated to cause from 5–30%
of all dementias. It occurs from decrease in blood flow tothe brain, most commonly due to a series of small strokes(multi-infarct dementia). Other cerebrovascular causesinclude: vasculitis from syphilis ,Lyme disease , or sys-"
"temic lupus erythematosus ; subdural hematoma ; and
subarachnoid hemorrhage . Because of the usually sud-
den nature of its cause, the symptoms of vascular demen-tia tend to begin more abruptly than those of Alzheimer’sdementia. Symptoms may progress stepwise with theoccurrence of new strokes. Unlike AD, the incidence ofvascular dementia is lower after age 75.
Other conditions which may cause dementia
include:

• Lewy body disease
• Pick’s disease

Symptoms
Dementia is marked by a gradual impoverishment of
thought and other mental activities. Losses eventuallyaffect virtually every aspect of mental life. The slow pro-gression of dementia is in contrast with delirium , which
involves some of the same symptoms, but has a veryrapid onset and fluctuating course with alteration in thelevel of consciousness. However, delirium may occurwith dementia, especially since the person with dementiais more susceptible to the delirium-inducing effects ofmay types of drugs.

• Impaired abstraction and planning. The person with

able to identify the time of day, even from obviousvisual clues; or may not recognize his or her location,even if familiar. This disability may stem partly fromlosses of memory and partly from impaired abstraction.• Decreased attention and increased restlessness. This

lose interest in once-pleasurable activities, and becomemore passive, depressed, or anxious. Delusions , suspi-
cion, paranoia , and hallucinations may occur later in
the disease. Sleep disturbances may occur, includinginsomnia and sleep interruptions.
Diagnosis
Since dementia usually progresses slowly, diagnos-
ing it in its early stages can be difficult. Several officevisits over several months or more may be needed. Diag-nosis begins with a thorough physical exam and com-plete medical history, usually including comments fromfamily members or caregivers. A family history of eitherAD or cerebrovascular disease may provide clues to thecause of symptoms. Simple tests of mental function,including word recall, object naming, and number-sym-bol matching, are used to track changes in the person’scognitive ability.

"Depression is common in the elderly and can be
mistaken for dementia; therefore, ruling out depression isan important part of the diagnosis. Distinguishingdementia from the mild normal cognitive decline ofadvanced age is also critical. The medical historyincludes a complete listing of drugs being taken, since anumber of drugs can cause dementia-like symptoms.
Determining the cause of dementia may require a
variety of medical tests, chosen to match the most likelyetiology. Cerebrovascular disease, hydrocephalus, andtumors may be diagnosed with x-rays, CT or MRI scans,and vascular imaging studies. Blood tests may revealnutritional deficiencies or hormone imbalances.

"Treatment
Treatment of dementia begins with treatment of
the underlying disease, where possible. The underlyingcauses of nutritional, hormonal, tumor-caused anddrug-related dementias may be reversible to someextent. Treatment for stroke-related dementia beginsby minimizing the risk of further strokes, throughsmoking cessation, aspirin therapy, and treatment of
hypertension , for instance. There are no therapies that
can reverse the progression of AD. Aspirin, estrogen,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1025Dementia"
"vitamin E, and selegiline are currently being evaluated
for their ability to slow the rate of progression.
Care for a person with dementia can be difficult and
complex. The patient must learn to cope with functionaland cognitive limitations, while family members or othercaregivers assume increasing responsibility for the per-son’s physical needs. In progressive dementias such asAD, the person may ultimately become completelydependent. Education of the patient and family early onin the disease progression can help them anticipate andplan for inevitable changes.
Symptoms of dementia may be treated with a com-
bination of psychotherapy, environmental modifications,and medication. Drug therapy can be complicated by for-getfulness, especially if the prescribed drug must betaken several times daily.

"Behavioral approaches may be used to reduce the
frequency or severity of problem behaviors, such asaggression or socially inappropriate conduct. Problembehavior may be a reaction to frustration or overstimula-tion; understanding and modifying the situations thattrigger it can be effective. Strategies may include break-ing down complex tasks, such as dressing or feeding,into simpler steps, or reducing the amount of activity inthe environment to avoid confusion and agitation. Plea-surable activities, such as crafts, games, and music, canprovide therapeutic stimulation and improve mood.

"Modifying the environment can increase safety and
comfort while decreasing agitation. Home modificationsfor safety include removal or lock-up of hazards such assharp knives, dangerous chemicals, and tools. Child-proof latches or Dutch doors may be used to limit accessas well. Lowering the hot water temperature to 120°F(48.9°C) or less reduces the risk of scalding. Bed railsand bathroom safety rails can be important safety mea-sures, as well. Confusion may be reduced with simplerdecorative schemes and presence of familiar objects.Covering or disguising doors (with a mural, for example)may reduce the tendency to wander. Positioning the bedin view of the bathroom can decrease incontinence.

"Two drugs, tacrine (Cognex) and donepezil (Ari-
cept), are commonly prescribed for AD. These drugsinhibit the breakdown of acetylcholine in the brain, pro-longing its ability to conduct chemical messages betweenbrain cells. They provide temporary improvement in cog-nitive functions for about 40% of patients with mild tomoderate AD. Hydergine is sometimes prescribed aswell, though it is of questionable benefit for mostpatients.
Psychotic symptoms, including paranoia, delusions,
and hallucinations, may be treated with antipsychotic
drugs , such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, risperidone,and clozapine. Side effects of these drugs can be signifi-
cant. Antianxiety drugs such as Valium may improve
behavioral symptoms, especially agitation and anxiety ,
although BuSpar has fewer side effects. The anticonvul-sant carbamazepine is also sometimes prescribed for agi-tation. Depression is treated with antidepressants, usuallybeginning with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors"
"(SSRIs) such as Prozac or Paxil, followed bymonoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepres-
sants. Electroconvulsive therapy may be appropriate for
some patients with severe depression who are unrespon-sive to drug therapy. In general, medications should beadministered very cautiously to demented patients, in thelowest possible effective doses, to minimize side effects.Supervision of taking medications is generally required.
Long-term institutional care may be needed for the
person with dementia, as profound cognitive losses oftenprecede death by a number of years. Early planning forthe financial burden of nursing home care is critical. Use-ful information about financial planning for long-termcare is available through the Alzheimer’s Association.

"dementia are often subject to extreme stress , and may
develop feelings of anger, resentment, guilt, and hopeless-ness, in addition to the sorrow they feel for their loved oneand for themselves. Depression is an extremely commonconsequence of being a full-time caregiver for a personwith dementia. Support groups can be an important wayto deal with the stress of caregiving. The location andcontact numbers for caregiver support groups are avail-able from the Alzheimer’s Association; they may also beavailable through a local social service agency or thepatient’s physician. Medical treatment for depression maybe an important adjunct to group support.
Alternative treatment
Several drugs are currently being tested for their
ability to slow the progress of AD. These includeacetyl-l-carnitine, which acts on the cellular energystructures known as mitochondria; propentofylline,which may aid circulation; milameline, which acts sim-ilarly to tacrine and donezepil; and ginkgo extract."
"Ginkgo extract, derived from the leaves of the Gink-
go biloba tree, interferes with a circulatory protein called
platelet activating factor. It also increases circulation andoxygenation to the brain. Ginkgo extract has been usedfor many years in China and is widely prescribed inEurope for treatment of circulatory problems. A 1997study of patients with dementia seemed to show thatgingko extract could improve their symptoms, though thestudy was criticized for certain flaws in its method.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1026Dementia"
"Prognosis
The prognosis for dementia depends on the underly-
ing disease. On average, people with Alzheimer’s diseaselive eight years past their diagnosis, with a range fromone to 20 years. Vascular dementia is usually progressive,with death from stroke , infection, or heart disease.
Prevention
There is no known way to prevent Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, although several of the drugs under investigationmay reduce its risk or slow its progression. The risk ofdeveloping multi-infarct dementia may be reduced byreducing the risk of stroke.

Dengue fever
Definition"
"Dengue fever
Definition
Dengue fever is a disease caused by one of a number
of viruses that are carried by mosquitoes. These mosqui-toes then transmit the virus to humans.
Description
The virus that causes dengue fever is called an
arbovirus, which stands for arthropod-borne virus. Mos-quitoes are a type of arthropod. In a number of regions,mosquitoes carry this virus and are responsible for pass-ing it along to humans. These regions include the MiddleEast, the far East, Africa, and the Caribbean Islands. Inthese locations, the dengue fever arbovirus is endemic,meaning that the virus naturally and consistently lives inthat location. The disease only shows up in the UnitedStates sporadically.
In order to understand how dengue fever is transmit-"
"In order to understand how dengue fever is transmit-
ted, several terms need to be defined. The word “host”means an animal (including a human) that can be infect-ed with a particular disease. The word “vector” means anorganism that can carry a particular disease-causingagent (like a virus or bacteria) without actually develop-ing the disease. The vector can then pass the virus or bac-teria on to a new host.
Many of the common illnesses in the United States
(including the common cold , many viral causes of diar-
rhea , and influenza or “flu”) are spread because the"
"rhea , and influenza or “flu”) are spread because the
viruses that cause these illness can be passed directlyfrom person to person. However, dengue fever cannot bepassed directly from one infected person to another.Instead, the virus responsible for dengue fever requiresan intermediate vector, a mosquito, that carries the virusfrom one host to another. The mosquito that carries thearbovirus responsible for dengue fever is the same typeof mosquito that can transmit other diseases, includingyellow fever . This mosquito is called Aedes egypti . The
most common victims are children younger than 10 yearsof age.
Causes and symptoms
Dengue fever can occur when a mosquito carrying
the arbovirus bites a human, passing the virus on to thenew host. Once in the body, the virus travels to variousglands where it multiplies. The virus can then enter the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1027Dengue fever"
"bloodstream. The presence of the virus within the blood
vessels, especially those feeding the skin, causes changesto these blood vessels. The vessels swell and leak. Thespleen and lymph nodes become enlarged, and patches ofliver tissue die. A process called disseminated intravascu-lar coagulation (DIC) occurs, where chemicals responsi-ble for clotting are used up and lead to a risk of severebleeding (hemorrhage).
After the virus has been transmitted to the human
host, a period of incubation occurs. During this time (last-ing about five to eight days) the virus multiplies. Symp-toms of the disease appear suddenly and include highfever , chills, headache , eye pain , red eyes, enlarged
lymph nodes, a red flush to the face, lower back pain,extreme weakness, and severe aches in the legs and joints.
This initial period of illness lasts about two–three"
"This initial period of illness lasts about two–three
days. After this time, the fever drops rapidly and thepatient sweats heavily. After about a day of feeling rela-tively well, the patient’s temperature increases again,although not as much as the first time. A rash of smallred bumps begins on the arms and legs, spreading to thechest, abdomen, and back. It rarely affects the face. Thepalms of the hands and the soles of the feet becomeswollen and turn bright red. The characteristic combina-tion of fever, rash, and headache are called the “denguetriad.” Most people recover fully from dengue fever,although weakness and fatigue may last for several
weeks. Once a person has been infected with denguefever, his or her immune system keeps producing cellsthat prevent reinfection for about a year.
More severe illness may occur in some people."
"More severe illness may occur in some people.
These people may be experiencing dengue fever for thefirst time. However, in some cases a person may havealready had dengue fever at one time, recovered, andthen is reinfected with the virus. In these cases, the firstinfection teaches the immune system to recognize thepresence of the arbovirus. When the immune cellsencounter the virus during later infections, the immunesystem over-reacts. These types of illnesses, calleddengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syn-drome (DSS), involve more severe symptoms. Fever andheadache are the first symptoms, but the other initialsymptoms of dengue fever are absent. The patient devel-ops a cough , followed by the appearance of small pur-"
"plish spots (petechiae) on the skin. These petechiae areareas where blood is leaking out of the vessels. Largebruised areas appear as the bleeding worsens and abdom-inal pain may be severe. The patient may begin to vomita substance that looks like coffee grounds. This is actual-ly a sign of bleeding into the stomach. As the blood ves-sels become more damaged, they leak more and continueto increase in diameter (dilate), causing a decrease inblood flow to all tissues of the body. This state of lowblood flow is called shock. Shock can result in damage to
the body’s organs (especially the heart and kidneys)because low blood flow deprives them of oxygen.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis should be suspected in endemic areas when-
ever a high fever goes on for two to seven days, especially ifaccompanied by a bleeding tendency. Symptoms of shockshould suggest the progression of the disease to DSS.
The arbovirus causing dengue fever is one of the few"
"The arbovirus causing dengue fever is one of the few
types of arbovirus that can be isolated from the serum ofthe blood. The serum is the fluid in which blood cells aresuspended. Serum can be tested because the phase inwhich the virus travels throughout the bloodstream islonger in dengue fever than in other arboviral infections.A number of tests are used to look for reactions betweenthe patient’s serum and laboratory-produced antibodies.Antibodies are special cells that recognize the markers(or antigens) present on invading organisms. Duringthese tests, antibodies are added to a sample of thepatient’s serum. Healthcare workers then look for reac-tions that would only occur if viral antigens were presentin that serum.

"Treatment
There is no treatment available to shorten the course
of dengue fever, DHF, or DSS. Medications can be givento lower the fever and to decrease the pain of muscleaches and headaches. Fluids are given through a needlein a vein to prevent dehydration . Blood transfusions
may be necessary if severe hemorrhaging occurs. Oxy-gen should be administered to patients in shock.
Prognosis
The prognosis for uncomplicated dengue fever is
very good, and almost 100% of patients fully recover.However, as many as 6–30% of all patients die whenDHF occurs. The death rate is especially high among the
youngest patients (under one year old). In places whereexcellent medical care is available, very close monitoringand immediate treatment of complications lowers thedeath rate among DHF and DSS patients to about 1%.

Dental trauma is injury to the mouth, including
teeth, lips, gums, tongue, and jawbones. The most com-mon dental trauma is a broken or lost tooth.KEY TERMS
Endemic —Naturally and consistently present in a

"Causes and symptoms
Soft tissue injuries, such as a “fat lip,” a burned
tongue, or a cut inside the cheek, are characterized bypain , redness, and swelling with or without bleeding. A
broken tooth often has a sharp edge that may cut thetongue and cheek. Depending on the position of the frac-ture, the tooth may or may not cause toothache pain.
When a tooth is knocked out (evulsed), the socket isswollen, painful, and bloody. A jawbone may be brokenif the upper and lower teeth no longer fit together proper-ly (malocclusion ), or if the jaws have pain with limited
ability to open and close (mobility), especially aroundthe temporomandibular joint (TMJ).
Diagnosis
Dental trauma is readily apparent upon examination.
Dental x rays may be taken to determine the extent of thedamage to broken teeth. More comprehensive x rays areneeded to diagnose a broken jaw.

"Treatment
Soft tissue injuries may require only cold compress-
es to reduce swelling. Bleeding may be controlled withdirect pressure applied with clean gauze. Deep lacera-tions and punctures may require stitches. Pain may bemanaged with aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol,
Aspirin Free Excedrin) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil).
Treatment of a broken tooth will vary depending on
the severity of the fracture. For immediate first aid, theinjured tooth and surrounding area should be rinsed gen-tly with warm water to remove dirt, then covered with acold compress to reduce swelling and ease pain. A dentistshould examine the injury as soon as possible. Any piecesfrom the broken tooth should be saved and brought along.

"the tooth will require root canal treatment before it
receives a crown. A tooth that is vertically fractured orfractured below the gumline will require root canal treat-ment and protective restoration. A tooth which no longerhas enough remaining structure to retain a crown mayhave to be extracted (surgically removed).
When a permanent tooth has been knocked out, it
may be saved with prompt action. The tooth must befound immediately after it has been lost. It should bepicked up by the natural crown (the top part covered byhard enamel). It must not be handled by the root. If thetooth is dirty, it may be gently rinsed under runningwater. It should never be scrubbed, and it should never bewashed with soap, toothpaste, mouthwash, or otherchemicals. The tooth should not be dried or wrapped in atissue or cloth. It must be kept moist at all times.

Rapid action improves the chances of successfulre-implantation; however, it is possible to save a toothafter 30 minutes, if the tooth has been kept moist andhandled properly.
The body usually rejects re-implantation of a prima-
ry (baby) tooth. In this case, the empty socket is treatedas a soft tissue injury and monitored until the permanenttooth erupts.

"Alternative treatment
There is no substitute for treatment by a dentist or
other medical professional. There are, however, homeo-pathic remedies and herbs that can be used simultaneous-ly with dental care and throughout the healing process.Homeopathic arnica ( Arnica montana ) should be taken as
soon as possible after the injury to help the body deal withthe trauma. Repeating a dose several times daily for theduration of healing is also useful. Homeopathic hyper-icum ( Hypericum perforatum ) can be taken if nerve pain
is involved, especially with a tooth extraction or root
canal. Homeopathic comfrey ( Symphytum officinale) may
be helpful in treating pain due to broken jaw bones, butshould only be used after the bones have been reset. Cal-endula ( Calendula officinalis ) and plantain ( Plantago
major ) can be used as a mouth rinse to enhance tissue
healing. These herbs should not be used with deep lacera-tions that need to heal from the inside first.Prognosis"
"When dental trauma receives timely attention and
proper treatment, the prognosis for healing is good. Aswith other types of trauma, infection may be a complica-tion, but a course of antibiotics is generally effective.
Prevention
Most dental trauma is preventable. Car seat belts
should always be worn, and young children should besecured in appropriate car seats. Homes should be moni-tored for potential tripping and slipping hazards. Child-proofing measures should be taken, especially for tod-dlers. In addition to placing gates across stairs andpadding sharp table edges, electrical cords should betucked away. Young children may receive severe oralburns from gnawing on live power cords.

"Everyone who participates in contact sports should
wear a mouthguard to avoid dental trauma. Athletes infootball, ice hockey, wrestling, and boxing commonlywear mouthguards.

Depo-Provera/Norplant
Definition
Norplant is a long-acting hormone that is inserted
under the skin and prevents conception for up to fiveyears. Depo-Provera is also a hormone, but is administeredby intramuscular injection and provides protection againstpregnancy for three months. Lunelle is another injectable
contraceptive that is administered monthly (every 28 to 30days); it was approved by the Food and Drug Administra-tion (FDA) in October 2000. The hormone in Norplant andDepo-Provera is progestin, a synthetic hormone similar toone found naturally in a woman’s body; Lunelle containsthe hormones progestin and estrogen.
Purpose
The purpose of these hormones is to prevent preg-
nancy; they are about 99% effective in achieving thisgoal. No hormonal contraceptive methods provide protec-tion from AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases .
Depo-Provera and Lunelle are given as an injection"
"Depo-Provera and Lunelle are given as an injection
and work in several ways to prevent conception. First,the egg (ovum) is prevented from maturing and beingreleased. The mucus in the cervix (opening into theuterus or womb) becomes thicker, making it difficult forthe sperm to enter. Depo-Provera and Lunelle also causethe lining of the uterus to become thinner, makingimplantation of a fertilized egg unlikely.
An injection of Depo-Provera or Lunelle must be
given within the first five days of a normal period. Depo-Provera provides protection against pregnancy for threemonths, while Lunelle provides similar protection forone month. Ovulation (release of a mature egg) typicallyoccurs within 60 days of the last injection of Lunelle,about twice as fast after use of Depo-Provera. Also,because Lunelle is a combined hormone contraceptive asopposed to progestin-only Depo-Provera and Norplant, itis less likely to cause irregular or absent menstruation."
"Norplant capsules contain a synthetic hormone that
is slowly released over a period of up to five years. Itfunctions like Depo-Provera in that it prevents theovaries from producing ova (eggs) and also results inthicker mucus in the cervix, which prevents the spermfrom passing through the cervix. Norplant can be insert-ed at any time.
Preparation
The woman being considered for Depo-Provera or
Lunelle will have a pelvic and breast examination, a Pap
test (a microscopic examination of cell samples taken
from the cervix), blood pressure check, weight check,and a review of her medical history. Women who havediabetes mellitus , major depression, blood clotting
problems, liver disease, or weight problems should usethese methods only under strict medical supervision.Depo-Provera or Lunelle should not be used if thewoman is pregnant, has unexplained vaginal bleeding,

"suffers from severe liver disease, has breast cancer ,o r
has a history of blood clots or stroke .
Individuals who select Norplant will receive the
same basic physical examination . If approved for this
method, a site of implantation will be selected (usuallythe inside of the upper arm), and the area prepared forminor surgery. The skin will be washed with soap andwater, and an antiseptic, such as iodine solution, will beapplied. The physician will use a local anesthetic tonumb the area, a small incision will be made, the sixNorplant capsules will be inserted, and the incision sewnup (sutured). Protection against pregnancy normallybegins within 24 hours. If necessary, the implants can beremoved in 15–20 minutes. Norplant should not be usedby women who are pregnant, have blood clotting prob-lems, or have unexplained vaginal bleeding. Advantagesinclude light periods with less cramping and decreasedanemia. This form of birth control may also be protectiveagainst endometrial cancer ."
"Because Depo-Provera and Norplant use only the
hormone progestin, they may provide an alternative forwomen who can not use estrogen-containing birth con-trol pills. One benefit of Lunelle, however, is that itseffects wear off more quickly than Depo-Provera, animportant factor in the event that a woman has seriousside effects or wants to become pregnant.
Risks
The most common side effects associated with
Depo-Provera and Lunelle are yellowing of the skin,headache , nervousness, dizziness , abdominal pain , hair
loss, rash, increase in the number of migraine headaches,increased or decreased interest in sexual intercourse, thedevelopment of dark spots on the skin, depression, andweakness. Danger signs that need to reported immediate-ly include weight gain, heavy vaginal bleeding, frequenturination, blurred vision, fainting , severe abdominal"
"pain, and coughing up blood. Because the effects ofDepo-Provera may last up to 12 weeks, it may take alonger time for women trying to conceive to becomepregnant after discontinuing the injections.KEY TERMS
Hormone —A chemical produced in a gland or
organ and transported by the blood to another areaof the body where it produces a specific effect.
Pap test —A microscopic examination of cell sam-
ples taken from the cervix.The main reactions to Norplant include headache,
weight gain, irregular periods or no period at all, breasttenderness, acne , gain or loss of facial hair, color
changes of the skin over the area of insertion, and ovari-
an cysts . The doctor should be notified immediately of
lumps in the breast, heavy vaginal bleeding, yellowing ofthe skin or eyes, or infection of the incision. Women whouse Norplant are discouraged from smoking .

Depressive disorders
Definition
Depression or depressive disorders (unipolar depres-
sion) are mental illnesses characterized by a profoundand persistent feeling of sadness or despair and/or a lossof interest in things that were once pleasurable. Distur-bance in sleep, appetite, and mental processes are a com-mon accompaniment.

"Description
Everyone experiences feelings of unhappiness and
sadness occasionally. But when these depressed feel-ings start to dominate everyday life and cause physicaland mental deterioration, they become what are knownas depressive disorders. Each year in the UnitedStates, depressive disorders affect an estimated 17million people at an approximate annual direct andindirect cost of $53 billion. One in four women is like-ly to experience an episode of severe depression in herlifetime, with a 10–20% lifetime prevalence, com-pared to 5–10% for men. The average age a firstdepressive episode occurs is in the mid-20s, althoughthe disorder strikes all age groups indiscriminately,from children to the elderly.

"There are two main categories of depressive disor-
ders: major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder.Major depressive disorder is a moderate to severeepisode of depression lasting two or more weeks. Indi-viduals experiencing this major depressive episode mayhave trouble sleeping, lose interest in activities they oncetook pleasure in, experience a change in weight, have dif-ficulty concentrating, feel worthless and hopeless, orhave a preoccupation with death or suicide. In children,
the major depression may appear as irritability.

"the major depression may appear as irritability.
While major depressive episodes may be acute
(intense but short-lived), dysthymic disorder is an ongo-ing, chronic depression that lasts two or more years (oneor more years in children) and has an average duration of16 years. The mild to moderate depression of dysthymicdisorder may rise and fall in intensity, and those afflictedwith the disorder may experience some periods of nor-mal, non-depressed mood of up to two months in length.Its onset is gradual, and dysthymic patients may not beable to pinpoint exactly when they started feelingdepressed. Individuals with dysthymic disorder mayexperience a change in sleeping and eating patterns, lowself-esteem, fatigue , trouble concentrating, and feelings
of hopelessness.
Depression can also occur in bipolar disorder ,a n"
"of hopelessness.
Depression can also occur in bipolar disorder ,a n
affective mental illness that causes radical emotionalchanges and mood swings, from manic highs to depres-sive lows. The majority of bipolar individuals experiencealternating episodes of mania and depression.
Causes and symptoms
The causes behind depression are complex and not
yet fully understood. While an imbalance of certain neu-rotransmitters—the chemicals in the brain that transmitmessages between nerve cell— is believed to be key todepression, external factors such as upbringing (more soin dysthymia than major depression) may be as impor-tant. For example, it is speculated that, if an individual is
abused and neglected throughout childhood and adoles-cence, a pattern of low self-esteem and negative thinkingmay emerge. From that, a lifelong pattern of depressionmay follow.
Heredity does seem to play a role in who develops"
"Heredity does seem to play a role in who develops
depressive disorders. Individuals with major depressionin their immediate family are up to three times morelikely to have the disorder themselves. It would seemthat biological and genetic factors may make certainindividuals pre-disposed or prone to depressive disor-ders, but environmental circumstances may often trig-ger the disorder.
External stressors and significant life changes, such
as chronic medical problems, death of a loved one,divorce or estrangement, miscarriage , or loss of a job,
can also result in a form of depression known as adjust-ment disorder. Although periods of adjustment disorderusually resolve themselves, occasionally they mayevolve into a major depressive disorder.

"Major depressive episode
Individuals experiencing a major depressive episode
have a depressed mood and/or a diminished interest orpleasure in activities. Children experiencing a majordepressive episode may appear or feel irritable ratherthan depressed. In addition, five or more of the followingsymptoms will occur on an almost daily basis for a peri-od of at least two weeks:
• Significant change in weight.
•Insomnia or hypersomnia (excessive sleep).
• Psychomotor agitation or retardation.
• Fatigue or loss of energy.
• Feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt.
• Diminished ability to think or to concentrate, or indeci-
siveness.

"Dysthymic disorder
Dysthymia commonly occurs in tandem with other
psychiatric and physical conditions. Up to 70% of dys-thymic patients have both dysthymic disorder and majordepressive disorder, known as double depression. Sub-stance abuse, panic disorders, personality disorders ,
social phobias , and other psychiatric conditions are also
found in many dysthymic patients. Dysthymia is prevalentin patients with certain medical conditions, including mul-
tiple sclerosis ,AIDS ,hypothyroidism ,chronic fatigue
syndrome ,Parkinson’s disease , diabetes, and post-car-
diac transplantation. The connection between dysthymicdisorder and these medical conditions is unclear, but itmay be related to the way the medical condition and/or itspharmacological treatment affects neurotransmitters. Dys-thymic disorder can lengthen or complicate the recoveryof patients also suffering from medical conditions.Along with an underlying feeling of depression,"
"people with dysthymic disorder experience two or moreof the following symptoms on an almost daily basis for aperiod for two or more years (most suffer for five years),or one year or more for children:
• under or overeating
• insomnia or hypersomnia
• low energy or fatigue
• low self-esteem
• poor concentration or trouble making decisions
• feelings of hopelessness
Diagnosis
In addition to an interview, several clinical invento-
ries or scales may be used to assess a patient’s mentalstatus and determine the presence of depressive symp-toms. Among these tests are: the Hamilton DepressionScale (HAM-D), Child Depression Inventory (CDI),Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Beck DepressionInventory (BDI), and the Zung Self-Rating Scale forDepression. These tests may be administered in an out-patient or hospital setting by a general practitioner, socialworker, psychiatrist, or psychologist.

"Treatment
Major depressive and dysthymic disorders are typi-
cally treated with antidepressants or psychosocial thera-py. Psychosocial therapy focuses on the personal andinterpersonal issues behind depression, while antidepres-sant medication is prescribed to provide more immediaterelief for the symptoms of the disorder. When usedtogether correctly, therapy and antidepressants are apowerful treatment plan for the depressed patient.
Antidepressants
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft) reducedepression by increasing levels of serotonin, a neuro-transmitter. Some clinicians prefer SSRIs for treatmentof dysthymic disorder. Anxiety ,diarrhea , drowsiness,
headache , sweating, nausea, poor sexual functioning,
and insomnia are all possible side effects of SSRIs.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are less expensive
than SSRIs, but have more severe side-effects, which mayinclude persistent dry mouth ,sedation ,dizziness , and"
"cardiac arrhythmias . Because of these side effects, cau-
tion is taken when prescribing TCAs to elderly patients.TCAs include amitriptyline (Elavil), imipramine (Tofra-nil), and nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor). A 10-day sup-ply of TCAs can be lethal if ingested all at once, so these

"drugs may not be a preferred treatment option for patients
at risk for suicide.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIS) such as
tranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenelzine (Nardil) blockthe action of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme inthe central nervous system. Patients taking MAOIs mustcut foods high in tyramine (found in aged cheeses andmeats) out of their diet to avoid potentially serioushypertensive side effects.
Heterocyclics include bupropion (Wellbutrin) and tra-
zodone (Desyrel). Bupropion should not be prescribed topatients with a seizure disorder . Side effects of the drug
may include agitation, anxiety, confusion, tremor, drymouth, fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, low bloodpressure, and insomnia. Because trazodone has a sedativeeffect, it is useful in treating depressed patients with insom-nia. Other possible side effects of trazodone include drymouth, gastrointestinal distress, dizziness, and headache.
Psychosocial therapy"
"Psychosocial therapy
Psychotherapy explores an individual’s life to bring
to light possible contributing causes of the presentdepression. During treatment, the therapist helps thepatient to become self-aware of his or her thinking pat-terns and how they came to be. There are several differ-ent subtypes of psychotherapy, but all have the commongoal of helping the patient develop healthy problem solv-ing and coping skills.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy assumes that the
patient’s faulty thinking is causing the current depressionand focuses on changing the depressed patient’s thoughtpatterns and perceptions. The therapist helps the patientidentify negative or distorted thought patterns and theemotions and behavior that accompany them, and thenretrains the depressed individual to recognize the think-ing and react differently to it.

"Electroconvulsant therapy
ECT, or electroconvulsive therapy , is usually
employed after all therapy and pharmaceutical treatmentoptions have been explored. However, it is sometimes usedearly in treatment when severe depression is present andthe patient refuses oral medication, or when the patient isbecoming dehydrated, extremely suicidal, or psychotic.
The treatment consists of a series of electrical pulses
that move into the brain through electrodes on thepatient’s head. ECT is given under general anesthesiaand patients are administered a muscle relaxant to pre-vent convulsions. Although the exact mechanisms behindthe success of ECT therapy are not known, it is believedthat the electrical current modifies the electrochemicalprocesses of the brain, consequently relieving depres-
sion. Headaches, muscle soreness, nausea, and confusionare possible side effects immediately following an ECTprocedure. Memory loss, typically transient, has alsobeen reported in ECT patients."
"Alternative treatment
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum ) is used
throughout Europe to treat depressive symptoms. Unliketraditional prescription antidepressants, this herbal anti-depressant has few reported side effects. Some users mayexperience high blood pressure, headaches, stiff neck,nausea, and vomiting. As of early 1998, United States.clinical trials organized by the National Institute of Men-tal Health were still in the planning phase. Its efficacy insevere depression is very uncertain.
Homeopathic treatment can also be very therapuetic
in treating depression. Good nutrition , proper sleep,

"exercise , and full engagement in life are very important
to a healthy mental state.
Prognosis
Untreated or improperly treated depression is the
number one cause of suicide in the United States. Propertreatment relieves symptoms in 80–90% of depressedpatients. After each major depressive episode, the risk ofrecurrence climbs significantly—50% after one episode,70% after two episodes, and 90% after three episodes.For this reason, patients need to be aware of the symp-toms of recurring depression and may require long-termmaintenance treatment of antidepressants and/or therapy.

"Prevention
Patient education in the form of therapy or self-help
groups is crucial for training patients with depressive dis-orders to recognize symptoms of depression and to takean active part in their treatment program. Extended main-tenance treatment with antidepressants may be requiredin some patients to prevent relapse. Early interventionwith children with depression is effective in arrestingdevelopment of more severe problems.

Dermatitis
Definition
Dermatitis is a general term used to describe inflam-
mation of the skin.
Description
Most types of dermatitis are characterized by an
itchy pink or red rash.
Contact dermatitis is an allergic reaction to some-
thing that irritates the skin and is manifested by one ormore lines of red, swollen, blistered skin that may itch or

"seep. It usually appears within 48 hours after touching or
brushing against a substance to which the skin is sensitive.The condition is more common in adults than in children.
Contact dermatitis can occur on any part of the body,
but it usually affects the hands, feet, and groin. Contactdermatitis usually does not spread from one person toanother, nor does it spread beyond the area exposed tothe irritant unless affected skin comes into contact withanother part of the body. However, in the case of someirritants, such as poison ivy, contact dermatitis can bepassed to another person or to another part of the body.
Stasis dermatitis is characterized by scaly, greasy
looking skin on the lower legs and around the ankles. Sta-sis dermatitis is most apt to affect the inner side of the calf.
Nummular dermatitis, which is also called nummular"
"Nummular dermatitis, which is also called nummular
eczematous dermatitis or nummular eczema, generallyaffects the hands, arms, legs, and buttocks of men andwomen older than 55 years of age. This stubborninflamed rash forms circular, sometimes itchy, patchesand is characterized by flares and periods of inactivity.
Atopic dermatitis is characterized by itching , scal-
ing, swelling, and sometimes blistering. In early child-hood it is called infantile eczema and is characterized byredness, oozing, and crusting. It is usually found on theface, inside the elbows, and behind the knees.
Seborrheic dermatitis may be dry or moist and is
characterized by greasy scales and yellowish crusts on thescalp, eyelids, face, external surfaces of the ears, under-arms, breasts, and groin. In infants it is called “cradle cap.”
Causes and symptoms

"Causes and symptoms
Allergic reactions are genetically determined, and
different substances cause contact dermatitis to developin different people. A reaction to resin produced by poi-son ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac is the most com-mon source of symptoms. It is, in fact, the most commonallergy in this country, affecting one of every two peoplein the United States.
Flowers, herbs, and vegetables can also affect the
skin of some people. Burns and sunburn increase the
risk of dermatitis developing, and chemical irritants thatcan cause the condition include:
• chlorine
• cleansers• detergents and soaps• fabric softeners
• glues used on artificial nails
• perfumes
• topical medicationsContact dermatitis can develop when the first con-
tact occurs or after years of use or exposure.
Stasis dermatitis, a consequence of poor circulation,"
"Stasis dermatitis, a consequence of poor circulation,
occurs when leg veins can no longer return blood to theheart as efficiently as they once did. When that happens,fluid collects in the lower legs and causes them to swell.Stasis dermatitis can also result in a rash that can breakdown into sores known as stasis ulcers.
The cause of nummular dermatitis is not known, but
it usually occurs in cold weather and is most common inpeople who have dry skin. Hot weather and stress can
aggravate this condition, as can the following:
•allergies
• fabric softeners
• soaps and detergents• wool clothing
• bathing more than once a day
Atopic dermatitis can be caused by allergies, asth-
ma, or stress, and there seems to be a genetic predisposi-
tion for atopic conditions. It is sometimes caused by anallergy to nickel in jewelry.
Seborrheic dermatitis (for which there may also be a"
"Seborrheic dermatitis (for which there may also be a
genetic predisposition) is usually caused by overproduc-tion of the oil glands. In adults it can be associated withdiabetes mellitus or gold allergy. In infants and adults it
may be caused by a biotin deficiency.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of dermatitis is made on the basis of
how the rash looks and its location. The doctor mayscrape off a small piece of affected skin for microscopicexamination or direct the patient to discontinue use of anypotential irritant that has recently come into contact with

"the affected area. Two weeks after the rash disappears, the
patient may resume use of the substances, one at a time,until the condition recurs. Eliminating the substance mostrecently added should eliminate the irritation.
If the origin of the irritation has still not been identi-
fied, a dermatologist may perform one or more patch tests.This involves dabbing a small amount of a suspected irri-tant onto skin on the patient’s back. If no irritation devel-ops within a few days, another patch test is performed. Theprocess continues until the patient experiences an allergicreaction at the spot where the irritant was applied.
Treatment
Treating contact dermatitis begins with eliminating
or avoiding the source of irritation. Prescription or over-the-counter corticosteroid creams can lessen inflamma-tion and relieve irritation. Creams, lotions, or ointmentsnot specifically formulated for dermatitis can intensifythe irritation. Oral antihistamines are sometimes recom-"
"mended to alleviate itching, and antibiotics are pre-
scribed if the rash becomes infected. Medications takenby mouth to relieve symptoms of dermatitis can makeskin red and scaly and cause hair loss.KEY TERMS
Allergic reaction —An inappropriate or exaggerat-
ed genetically determined reaction to a chemicalthat occurs only on the second or subsequentexposures to the offending agent, after the firstcontact has sensitized the body.
Corticosteriod —A group of synthetic hormones
that are used to prevent or reduce inflammation.Toxic effects may result from rapid withdrawal afterprolonged use or from continued use of large doses.
Patch test —A skin test that is done to identify aller-
gens. A suspected substance is applied to the skin.After 24–48 hours, if the area is red and swollen,the test is positive for that substance. If no reactionoccurs, another substance is applied. This is con-tinued until the patient experiences an allergicreaction where the irritant was applied to the skin."
"Rash —A spotted, pink or red skin eruption that
may be accompanied by itching and is caused bydisease, contact with an allergen, food ingestion,or drug reaction.
Ulcer —An open sore on the skin, resulting from
tissue destruction, that is usually accompanied byredness, pain, or infection.Patients who have a history of dermatitis should
remove their rings before washing their hands. Theyshould use bath oils or glycerine-based soaps and bathein lukewarm saltwater.
Patting rather than rubbing the skin after bathing and
thoroughly massaging lubricating lotion or nonprescrip-tion cortisone creams into still-damp skin can soothe red,irritated nummular dermatitis. Highly concentrated corti-sone preparations should not be applied to the face,armpits, groin, or rectal area. Periodic medical monitoringis necessary to detect side effects in patients who use suchpreparations on rashes covering large areas of the body.

"Coal-tar salves can help relieve symptoms of num-
mular dermatitis that have not responded to other treat-ments, but these ointments have an unpleasant odor andstain clothing.
Patients who have stasis dermatitis should elevate
their legs as often as possible and sleep with a pillowbetween the lower legs.
Tar or zinc paste may also be used to treat stasis der-
matitis. Because these compounds must remain in con-tact with the rash for as long as two weeks, the paste andbandages must be applied by a nurse or a doctor.
Coal-tar shampoos may be used for seborrheic der-
matitis that occurs on the scalp. Sun exposure after theuse of these shampoos should be avoided because therisk of sunburn of the scalp is increased.
Alternative treatment
Some herbal therapies can be useful for skin condi-
tions. Among the herbs most often recommended are:
• Burdock root ( Arctium lappa )
• Calendula ( Calendula officinalis ) ointment
• Chamomile ( Matricaria recutita ) ointment
• Cleavers ( Galium ssp.)"
"• Chamomile ( Matricaria recutita ) ointment
• Cleavers ( Galium ssp.)
• Evening primrose oil ( Oenothera biennis )
• Nettles ( Urtica dioica )
Contact dermatitis can be treated botanically and
homeopathically. Grindelia ( Grindelia spp.) and sas-
safras ( Sassafras albidum ) can help when applied topi-
cally. Determining the source of the problem and elimi-nating it is essential. Oatmeal baths are very helpful inrelieving the itch. Bentonite clay packs or any mud packdraws the fluid out, and helps dry up the lesions. Corti-sone creams are not recommended.
Stasis dermatitis should be treated by a trained prac-
titioner. This condition responds well to topical herbaltherapies, however, the cause must also be addressed.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1038Dermatitis"
"Selenium-based shampoos, topical applications of flax oil
and/or olive oil, and biotin supplementation are amongthe therapies recommended for seborrheic dermatitis.
Prognosis
Dermatitis is often chronic, but symptoms can gen-
erally be controlled.
Prevention
Contact dermatitis can be prevented by avoiding the
source of irritation. If the irritant cannot be avoided com-pletely, the patient should wear gloves and other protec-tive clothing whenever exposure is likely to occur.
Immediately washing the exposed area with soap
and water can stem allergic reactions to poison ivy, poi-son oak, or poison sumac, but because soaps can dry theskin, patients susceptible to dermatitis should use themonly on the face, feet, genitals, and underarms.
Clothing should be loose fitting and 100% cotton.
New clothing should be washed in dye-free, unscenteddetergent before being worn.

"Injury to the lower leg can cause stasis dermatitis to
ulcerate (form open sores). If stasis ulcers develop, adoctor should be notified immediately.
Yoga and other relaxation techniques may help pre-
vent atopic dermatitis caused by stress.
Avoidance of sweating may aid in preventing sebor-
rheic dermatitis.
A patient who has dermatitis should also notify a
doctor if any of the following occurs:
• fever develops
• skin oozes or other signs of infection appear
• symptoms do not begin to subside after seven days’
treatment
• he/she comes into contact with someone who has a
wart, cold sore , or other viral skin infection

DES exposure
Definition
DES (diethylstilbestrol) is a hormone that was pre-
scribed for pregnant women in the 1950s and early1960s. Many years later, doctors discovered that thedaughters of the women who received DES were at highrisk for a variety of problems, including infertility ,pre-
mature labor , and cancer of the vagina and cervix.

"Description
In the 1950s and early 1960s, several drug compa-
nies claimed that DES (diethylstilbestrol) could preventmiscarriages. DES is a synthetic hormone, related toestrogen. Since up to 20% of all pregnancies end in mis-
carriage , this seemed like an important breakthrough
and DES was prescribed for many women who hadbleeding in early pregnancy . Ultimately, it was found to
have no effect on miscarriages and the practice of pre-scribing DES was stopped in the 1960s. Almost 10 yearslater, the daughters of women who had taken DES duringpregnancy began to develop unusual symptoms.
Doctors discovered that when these young women
reached their teens, they were at higher risk for a varietyof problems, including:
• clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix• infertility
•premature labor and other problems in pregnancy

In the early 1970s, there was an increase in a rare
form of cancer, clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vaginaand cervix. Up until that time, doctors had seen thesecancers only in elderly women. Suddenly, young womenwho had the disease appeared.
This was so unusual that researchers studied these
women to see if they had anything in common. After agreat deal of questioning and examination, it was foundthat they all had one factor in common. All of the youngwomen had been exposed to DES in utero in the earlyweeks of pregnancy.
Today, it is difficult to imagine how shocking this
discovery was. Doctors had only recently recognized thatmedications and exposure to chemicals during pregnancycould cause birth defects . This was a birth defect that

"had gone undetected for almost two decades.
Since then, doctors have studied DES daughters very
carefully. Fortunately, the risk of clear cell adenocarcino-ma is actually quite low. In fact, it appears that if a DESdaughter has not developed this cancer by age 30, shewill not develop it. Since all DES daughters are now overage 30, there should be no further cases related to DESexposure. However, there are a number of other symp-toms and problems associated with DES exposure.
• Cervix and vagina. DES daughters often have distinc-
tive changes of the cervix and vagina that can be seenduring a pelvic exam . These changes include a cervical
hood (a vaginal fold draped over the cervix),cockscomb cervix (an abnormally shaped cervix), andadenosis (glandular cells normally located within thecervix that appear on the outside of the cervix and inthe vagina).KEY TERMS

Women who have been exposed to DES should have
a pelvic exam at least once a year. In addition to the usualpelvic exam and Pap smear, DES daughters should alsohave Pap smears of the vagina and, if possible, col-
poscopy . During colposcopy, the doctor looks at the
cervix and vagina through a special magnifying scope. Inthis way, tiny areas of abnormal cells can be seen. Thisprocedure is easily performed in the doctor’s office.
When DES daughters get pregnant, they may be at
high risk for premature labor and birth and should bemonitored very carefully.
Not all women who were exposed to DES develop
problems in pregnancy. However, if problems like infer-tility or miscarriage do occur, the doctor may recom-mend a special x-ray test to check the woman’s fallopiantubes and uterus. This special test is called a hysterosalp-ingogram.

"Treatment
There is no treatment for the abnormalities of the
fallopian tubes and uterus caused by DES exposure. For-tunately, there are treatments that can help with infertilityand premature labor. Clear cell adenocarcinoma of thevagina or cervix must be treated with surgery and, possi-bly,chemotherapy .

"Detoxification
Definition
Detoxification is one of the more widely used treat-
ments and concepts in alternative medicine. It is based onthe principle that illnesses can be caused by the accumu-lation of toxic substances (toxins) in the body. Eliminat-ing existing toxins and avoiding new toxins are essentialparts of the healing process. Detoxification utilizes avariety of tests and techniques.
Purpose
Detoxification is helpful for those patients suffering
from many chronic diseases and conditions, includingallergies ,anxiety , arthritis, asthma , chronic infections,
depression, diabetes, headaches, heart disease, high
cholesterol , low blood sugar levels, digestive disorders,
mental illness, and obesity . It is helpful for those with
conditions that are influenced by environmental factors,such as cancer , as well as for those who have been"
"exposed to high levels of toxic materials due to accidentor occupation. Detoxification therapy is useful for thosesuffering from allergies or immune system problemsthat conventional medicine is unable to diagnose ortreat, including chronic fatigue syndrome , environ-
mental illness/multiple chemical sensitivity, andfibromyalgia . Symptoms for those suffering these con-
ditions may include unexplained fatigue , increased
allergies, hypersensitivity to common materials, intoler-ance to certain foods and indigestion , aches and pains,
low grade fever , headaches, insomnia , depression, sore
throats, sudden weight loss or gain, lowered resistanceto infection, general malaise, and disability. Detoxifica-tion can be used as a beneficial preventative measureand as a tool to increase overall health, vitality, andresistance to disease.

"thousands of years. Fasting , is one of the oldest therapeu-
tic practices in medicine. Hippocrates, the ancient Greekknown as the “Father of Western medicine,” recommend-ed fasting as a means for improving health. Ayurvedic
medicine , a traditional healing system that has developed
over thousands of years, utilizes detoxification methodsto treat many chronic conditions and to prevent illness.
Detoxification treatment has become one of the cor-
nerstones of alternative medicine. Conventional medicinenotes that environmental factors can play a significant rolein many illnesses. Environmental medicine is a field thatstudies exactly how those environmental factors influencedisease. Conditions such as asthma, cancer, chronicfatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivity , and"
"many others are strongly influenced by exposure to toxicor allergenic substances in the environment. The UnitedStates Centers for Disease Control estimate that over 80%of all illnesses have environmental and lifestyle causes.
Detoxification has also become a prominent treat-
ment as people have become more aware of environmen-tal pollution. It is estimated that one in every four Ameri-cans suffers from some level of heavy metal poisoning ."
"Heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, cadmium, andarsenic, are by-products of industry. Synthetic agricul-ture chemicals, many of which are known to cause healthproblems, are also found in food, air, and water. Ameri-can agriculture uses nearly 10 lb (4.5 kg) of pesticidesper person on the food supply each year. These toxinshave become almost unavoidable. Pesticides that areused only on crops in the southern United States havebeen found in the tissue of animals in the far north ofCanada. DDT, a cancer-causing insecticide that has beenbanned for decades, is still regularly found in the fattytissue of animals, birds, and fish, even in extremelyremote regions such as the North Pole.
The problem of toxins in the environment is com-"
"The problem of toxins in the environment is com-
pounded because humans are at the top of the food chainand are more likely to be exposed to an accumulation oftoxic substances in the food supply. For instance, pesti-cides and herbicides are sprayed on grains that are thenfed to farm animals. Toxic substances are stored in thefatty tissue of those animals. In addition, those animalsare often injected with synthetic hormones, antibiotics ,
and other chemicals. When people eat meat products,they are exposed to the full range of chemicals and addi-tives used along the entire agricultural chain. Detoxifica-tion specialists call this build up of toxins bioaccumula-
tion. They assert that the bioaccumulation of toxic sub-
stances over time is responsible for many physical andmental disorders, especially ones that are increasingrapidly (like asthma, cancer, and mental illness). As aresult, detoxification therapies are increasing in impor-tance and popularity."
"Toxins in the body include heavy metals and various
chemicals such as pesticides, pollutants, and food addi-tives. Drugs and alcohol have toxic effects in the body.Toxins are produced as normal by-products in theintestines by the bacteria that break down food. The diges-tion of protein also creates toxic by-products in the body.
The body has natural methods of detoxification.
Individual cells get detoxified in the lymph and circula-tory system. The liver is the principle organ of detoxifi-

"cation, assisted by the kidneys and intestines. Toxins can
be excreted from the body by the kidneys, bowels, skin,and lungs. Detoxification treatments become necessarywhen the body’s natural detoxification systems becomeoverwhelmed. This can be caused by long-term effects ofimproper diet, stress , overeating, sedentary lifestyles, ill-
ness, and poor health habits in general. When a build upof toxic substances in the body creates illness, it’s calledtoxemia. Some people’s digestive tracts become unableto digest food properly, due to years of overeating anddiets that are high in fat and processed foods and low in
fiber (the average American diet). When this happens,food cannot pass through the digestive tract efficiently.Instead of being digested properly or eliminated from thebowel, food can literally rot inside the digestive tract andproduce toxic by-products. This state is known as toxiccolon syndrome or intestinal toxemia.

"Detoxification therapies try to activate and assist the
body’s own detoxification processes. They also try toeliminate additional exposure to toxins and strengthenthe body and immune system so that toxic imbalanceswon’t occur in the future.
Testing for toxic substances
Detoxification specialists use a variety of tests to
determine the causes contributing to toxic conditions.These causes include infections, allergies, addictions,toxic chemicals, and digestive and organ dysfunction.Blood, urine, stool, and hair analyses, as well as allergy
tests , are used to measure a variety of bodily functions
that may indicate problems. Detoxification therapistsusually have access to laboratories that specialize insophisticated diagnostic tests for toxic conditions.
People who have toxemia are often susceptible to"
"People who have toxemia are often susceptible to
infection because their immune systems are weakened.Infections can be caused by parasites, bacteria, viruses,and a common yeast. Therapists will screen patients forunderlying infections that may be contributing to illness.
Liver function is studied closely with blood and
urine tests because the liver is the principle organ in thebody responsible for removing toxic compounds. Whenthe liver detoxifies a substance from the body, it does soin two phases. Tests are performed that indicate whereproblems may be occurring in these phases, which maypoint to specific types of toxins. Blood and urine testscan also be completed that screen for toxic chemicalssuch as PCBs (environmental poisons), formaldehyde (acommon preservative), pesticides, and heavy metals.Another useful blood test is a test for zinc deficiency,which may reveal heavy metal poisoning . Hair analysis"
"is used to test for heavy metal levels in the body. Bloodand urine tests check immune system activity, and hor-mone levels can also indicate specific toxic compounds.
A 24-hour urine analysis, where samples are takenaround the clock, allows therapists to determine the effi-ciency of the digestive tract and kidneys. Together withstool analysis, these tests may indicate toxic bowel syn-drome and digestive system disorders. Certain blood andurine tests may point to nutritional deficiencies and prop-er recovery diets can be designed for patients as well.
Detoxification therapists may also perform extensive
allergy and hypersensitivity tests. Intradermal (betweenlayers of the skin) and sublingual (under the tongue)allergy tests are used to determine a patient’s sensitivityto a variety of common substances, including formalde-hyde, auto exhaust, perfume, tobacco, chlorine, jet fuel,and other chemicals.
Food allergies require additional tests because these"
"Food allergies require additional tests because these
allergies often cause reactions that are delayed for severaldays after the food is eaten. The RAST (radioallergosor-bent test) is a blood test that determines the level of anti-bodies (immunoglobulins) in the blood after specificfoods are eaten. The cytotoxic test is a blood test thatdetermines if certain substances affect blood cells, includ-ing foods and chemicals. The ELISA-ACT (enzyme-linked immunoserological assay activated cell test) isconsidered to be one of the most accurate tests for aller-gies and hypersensitivity to foods, chemicals, and otheragents. Other tests for food allergies are the eliminationand rotation diets, in which foods are systematically eval-uated to determine the ones that are causing problems.
Detoxification therapists usually interview and
counsel patients closely to determine and correctlifestyle, occupational, psychological, and emotional fac-tors that may also be contributing to illness."
"Detoxification therapies
Detoxification therapists use a variety of healing
techniques after a diagnosis is made. The first step is toeliminate a patient’s exposure to all toxic or allergenicsubstances. These include heavy metals, chemicals, radi-ation (from x rays, power lines, cell phones, computerscreens, and microwaves), smog, polluted water, foods,drugs, caffeine , alcohol, perfume, excess noise, and
stress. If mercury poisoning has been determined, thepatient will be advised to have mercury fillings from theteeth removed, preferably by a holistic dentist.
Specific treatments are used to stimulate and assist
the body’s detoxification process. Dietary change isimmediately enacted, eliminating allergic and unhealthyfoods, and emphasizing foods that assist detoxificationand support healing. Detoxification diets are generallylow in fat, high in fiber, and vegetarian with a raw foodemphasis. Processed foods, alcohol, and caffeine are

"avoided. Nutritional supplements such as vitamins ,min-
erals , antioxidants, amino acids, and essential fatty acids
are often prescribed. Spirulina is a sea algae that is fre-quently given to assist in eliminating heavy metals.Lipotropic agents are certain vitamins and nutrients thatpromote the flow of bile and fat from the liver.
Many herbal supplements are used in detoxification
therapies as well. Milk thistle extract, called silymarin, isone of the more potent herbs for detoxifying the liver.Naturopathy, Ayurvedic medicine, and traditional Chi-
nese medicine (TCM) recommend numerous herbal for-
mulas for detoxification and immune strengthening. Ifinfections or parasites have been found, these are treatedwith herbal formulas and, in difficult cases, antibiotics.

um seeds may be given to cleanse the digestive tract andpromote elimination. Colonics are used to cleanse thelower intestines. Digestive enzymes are prescribed toimprove digestion, and acidophilus and other friendlybacteria are reintroduced into the system with nutritionalsupplements.
Fasting is another major therapy in detoxification.
Fasting is one of the quickest ways to promote the elimina-tion of stored toxins in the body and to prompt the healingprocess. People with severe toxic conditions are supervisedclosely during fasting because the number of toxins in thebody temporarily increases as they are being released.
Chelation therapy is used by detoxification special-
ists to rid the body of heavy metals. Chelates are particu-lar substances that bind to heavy metals and speed theirelimination. Homeopathic remedies have also been
shown to be effective for removing heavy metals.

"shown to be effective for removing heavy metals.
Sweating therapies can also detoxify the body
because the skin is a major organ of elimination. Sweatinghelps release those toxins that are stored in the subcuta-neous (under the skin) fat cells. Saunas, therapeutic baths,and exercise are some of these treatments. Body therapies
may also be prescribed, including massage therapy ,acu-
pressure ,shiatsu , manual lymph drainage, and polarity
therapy . These body therapies seek to improve circulatory
and structural problems, reduce stress, and promote heal-ing responses in the body. Mind/body therapies such aspsychotherapy, counseling, and stress management tech-niques may be used to heal the psychological componentsof illness and to help patients overcome their negative pat-terns contributing to illness.

"Practitioners and treatment costs
The costs of detoxification therapies can vary wide-
ly, depending on the number of tests and treatmentsrequired. Detoxification treatments can be lengthy andinvolved since illnesses associated with toxic conditionsusually develop over many years and may not clear upquickly. Detoxification treatments may be lengthybecause they often strive for the holistic healing of thebody, mind, and emotions.
Practitioners may be conventionally trained medical
doctors with specialties in environmental medicine orinterests in alternative treatment. The majority of detoxi-fication therapists are alternative practitioners, such asnaturopaths, homeopaths, ayurvedic doctors, or tradition-al Chinese doctors. Insurance coverage varies, depending

Deviated septum
Definition
The nasal septum is a thin structure, separating the
two sides of the nose. If it is not in the middle of thenose, then it is deviated."
"two sides of the nose. If it is not in the middle of thenose, then it is deviated.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1044Deviated septum"
"Description
The nasal septum is composed of two parts. Toward
the back of the head the nasal septum is rigid bone, butfurther forward the bone becomes cartilage. With onefinger in each nostril this cartilage can easily be bentback and forth. If the nasal septum is sufficiently dis-placed to one side, it will impede the flow of air andmucus through the nose. This condition, called a deviat-ed septum, can cause symptoms and disease.
Causes and symptoms
A deviated septum can be a simple variation in nor-
mal structure or the result of a broken nose. Any narrow-ing of the nasal passageway that it causes will threatenthe drainage of secretions from the sinuses, which mustpass through the nose. It is a general rule of medicinethat when flow is obstructed, whether it is mucus fromthe sinuses or bile from the gall bladder, infection results.People with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) are at greater"
"risk of obstruction because their nasal passageways arealready narrowed by the swollen membranes lining them.The result is sinusitis , which can be acute and severe or
chronic and lingering.
Diagnosis
It is easy to see that a septum is deviated. It is more
difficult to determine if that deviation needs correction. Itis common for a patient to complain that he/she canbreathe through only one nostril. Then the diagnosis iseasy. A deviated septum may also contribute to snoring ,
sleep apnea , and other breathing disorders.
Treatment
The definitive treatment is surgical repositioning of
the septum, accomplished by breaking it loose and fixingit in a proper place while it heals. Decongestants like
pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine will shrink themembranes and thereby enlarge the passages. Antihista-
mines , nasal cortisone spray, and other allergy treat-
ments may also be temporarily beneficial.
Alternative treatment

"Alternative treatment
As a palliative, saline drops and sprays are very help-
ful in loosening mucus in the obstructed side and prevent-ing drying in the other side, where all the air blows. Hotpeppers, such as jalapenos, can produce enough tears anddischarge to flush out a stopped-up nose. An even moreeffective treatment is called a nasal lavage, often doneusing a small pot with a spout. Saline solution is pouredinto one nostril and allowed to flow out the other nostril.Then, the process is repeated in reverse. These therapies
are all useful to take care of symptoms, but do not correctthe problem. Nasospecific, a procedure where a deflatedballoon is inserted in the nostril and inflated to a largeenough degree to adjust the septal deviation, can be analternative to surgery. A trained practitioner in thenasospecific procedure is necessary.

Surgical repair is curative and carries little risk."
"Prognosis
Surgical repair is curative and carries little risk.
Chronic infection can be painful and lead to complica-tions until it is resolved. If there is continued obstruction,the infection will very likely return.
Prevention
Avoidance of virus colds, airborne dusts, air pollu-
tion, and known allergens will minimize the irritationand swelling of the membranes lining the nasal passages.

Diabetes insipidus
Definition
Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder that causes the
patient to produce tremendous quantities of urine. Themassively increased urine output is usually accompaniedby intense thirst.
Description
The balance of fluid within the body is maintained
through a number of mechanisms. One important chemi-cal involved in fluid balance is called antidiuretic hor-mone (ADH). ADH is produced by the pituitary, a smallgland located at the base of the brain. In a healthy personand under normal conditions, ADH is continuouslyKEY TERMS

Sinuses —The nasal sinuses, air-filled cavities sur-
rounding the eyes and nose, like the nose itself arelined with mucus-producing membranes. Theyprovide cleansing to the nose, resonance to thevoice, and structure to the face.

temporarily interrupted during sleep. It leads tohigh blood pressure, sleepiness, and a variety ofother problems.released. ADH influences the amount of fluid that the
kidneys reabsorb into the circulatory system and theamount of fluid that the kidneys pass out of the body inthe form of urine.
Production of ADH is regulated by the osmolality of"
"Production of ADH is regulated by the osmolality of
the circulating blood. Osmolality refers to the concentra-tion of dissolved chemicals (such as sodium, potassium,and chloride; together called solute) circulating in thefluid base of the blood (plasma). When there is very littlefluid compared to the concentration of solute, the pitu-itary will increase ADH production. This tells the kid-neys to retain more water and to decrease the amount ofurine produced. As fluid is retained, the concentration ofsolute will normalize. At other times, when the fluid con-tent of the blood is high in comparison to the concentra-tion of solute, ADH production will decrease. The kid-neys are then free to pass an increased amount of fluidout of the body in the urine. Again, this will allow theplasma osmolality to return to normal.
Diabetes insipidus occurs when either the amount of"
"Diabetes insipidus occurs when either the amount of
ADH produced by the pituitary is below normal (centralDI), or the kidneys’ ability to respond to ADH is defective(nephrogenic DI). In either case, a person with DI willpass extraordinarily large quantities of urine, sometimesreaching 10 or more liters each day. At the same time, thepatient’s blood will be very highly concentrated, with lowfluid volume and high concentrations of solute.
DI occurs on average when a person is about 24
years old, and occurs more frequently in males than infemales.
Causes and symptoms
DI may run in families. The cause of this type of DI
is unknown. Other times, central DI can be caused by:
• an injury to the head• brain surgery• cancers that have spread to the pituitary gland (most
commonly occurring with breast cancer )
• sarcoidosis (or other related disorders), causing
destruction of the pituitary gland
• any condition or illness that causes decreased oxygen
delivery to the brain"
"• any condition or illness that causes decreased oxygen
delivery to the brain
• the use of certain medications that decrease ADH produc-
tion (like the antiseizure drug phenytoin)
• the excessive use of alcohol
Central DI may also occur in women who are preg-
nant or have just given birth, and in patients with AIDS
who have suffered certain types of brain infections.Nephrogenic DI sometimes occurs in patients who are

levels of blood calcium, and patients who are pregnant.
DI is easily confused with an entirely unrelated dis-
order, psychogenic polydipsia. Polydipsia refers todrinking large amounts of water. Psychogenic polydipsiais a psychiatric problem that makes a person drink hugequantities of water uncontrollably.
Symptoms of DI include extreme thirst and the pro-
duction of tremendous quantities of urine. Patients withDI typically drink huge amounts of water, and usuallyreport a specific craving for cold water. When the amountof water passed in the urine exceeds the patient’s abilityto drink ample replacement water, the patient may beginto suffer from symptoms of dehydration . These symp-
toms include weakness, fatigue ,fever , low blood pres-
sure, increased heart rate, dizziness , and confusion. If
left untreated, the patient could lapse into unconscious-ness and die.

"Diagnosis
Diagnosis should be suspected in any patient with
sudden increased thirst and urination. Laboratory exami-nation of urine will reveal very dilute urine, made upmostly of water with no solute. Examination of the bloodwill reveal very concentrated blood, high in solute andlow in fluid volume.
A water deprivation test may be performed. This test
requires a patient to stop all fluid intake. The patient isweighed just before the test begins, and urine is collectedand examined hourly. The test is stopped when:
• the patient has lost more than 5% of his or her original
body weight
• the patient has reached certain limits of low blood pres-
sure and increased heart rate
• the urine is no longer changing significantly from one
sample to the next in terms of solute concentration

"The next step of the test involves injecting a synthet-
ic form of ADH, with one last urine sample examined 60minutes later. Comparing plasma and urine osmolalityallows the doctor to diagnose either central DI, nephro-genic DI, partial DI, or psychogenic polydipsia.
Treatment
A number of medications can be given to decrease
the quantity of fluid passed out into the urine. Theseinclude vasopressin (Pitressin) injected and desmo-pressin acetate (DDA VP) inhaled through the nose. Othermedications that may be given include some antidiureticdrugs (chlorpropamide, clofibrate, carbamazepine).Patients with nephrogenic DI, however, will also requireKEY TERMS

"Background
Every cell in the human body needs energy in order
to function. The body’s primary energy source is glu-cose, a simple sugar resulting from the digestion offoods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches).Glucose from the digested food circulates in the bloodas a ready energy source for any cells that need it.Insulin is a hormone or chemical produced by cells inthe pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach.Insulin bonds to a receptor site on the outside of cell andacts like a key to open a doorway into the cell throughwhich glucose can enter. Some of the glucose can beconverted to concentrated energy sources like glycogenor fatty acids and saved for later use. When there is notenough insulin produced or when the doorway no longerrecognizes the insulin key, glucose stays in the bloodrather entering the cells.

"The body will attempt to dilute the high level of
glucose in the blood, a condition called hyperglycemia,by drawing water out of the cells and into the blood-stream in an effort to dilute the sugar and excrete it inthe urine. It is not unusual for people with undiagnoseddiabetes to be constantly thirsty, drink large quantities ofwater, and urinate frequently as their bodies try to get ridof the extra glucose. This creates high levels of glucosein the urine.
At the same time that the body is trying to get rid"
"At the same time that the body is trying to get rid
of glucose from the blood, the cells are starving for glu-cose and sending signals to the body to eat more food,thus making patients extremely hungry. To provideenergy for the starving cells, the body also tries to con-vert fats and proteins to glucose. The breakdown of fatsand proteins for energy causes acid compounds calledketones to form in the blood. Ketones will also beexcreted in the urine. As ketones build up in the blood,a condition called ketoacidosis can occur. This condi-tion can be life threatening if left untreated, leading tocoma and death .Types of diabetes mellitus
Type I diabetes, sometimes called juvenile diabetes,"
"Type I diabetes, sometimes called juvenile diabetes,
begins most commonly in childhood or adolescence. Inthis form of diabetes, the body produces little or noinsulin. It is characterized by a sudden onset and occursmore frequently in populations descended from NorthernEuropean countries (Finland, Scotland, Scandinavia) thanin those from Southern European countries, the MiddleEast, or Asia. In the United States, approximately threepeople in 1,000 develop Type I diabetes. This form is alsocalled insulin-dependent diabetes because people whodevelop this type need to have daily injections of insulin.
Brittle diabetics are a subgroup of Type I where
patients have frequent and rapid swings of blood sugarlevels between hyperglycemia (a condition where there istoo much glucose or sugar in the blood) and hypo-
glycemia (a condition where there is abnormally low lev-"
"glycemia (a condition where there is abnormally low lev-
els of glucose or sugar in the blood). These patients mayrequire several injections of different types of insulinduring the day to keep the blood sugar level within a fair-ly normal range.
The more common form of diabetes, Type II, occurs
in approximately 3–5% of Americans under 50 years ofage, and increases to 10–15% in those over 50. Morethan 90% of the diabetics in the United States are Type IIdiabetics. Sometimes called age-onset or adult-onset dia-betes, this form of diabetes occurs most often in peoplewho are overweight and who do not exercise . It is also
more common in people of Native American, Hispanic,and African-American descent. People who have migrat-ed to Western cultures from East India, Japan, and Aus-tralian Aboriginal cultures are also more likely to devel-op Type II diabetes than those who remain in their origi-nal countries.
Type II is considered a milder form of diabetes"
"Type II is considered a milder form of diabetes
because of its slow onset (sometimes developing over thecourse of several years) and because it can usually becontrolled with diet and oral medication. The conse-quences of uncontrolled and untreated Type II diabetes,however, are the just as serious as those for Type I. Thisform is also called noninsulin-dependent diabetes, a termthat is somewhat misleading. Many people with Type IIdiabetes can control the condition with diet and oralmedications, however, insulin injections are sometimesnecessary if treatment with diet and oral medication isnot working.
Another form of diabetes called gestational dia-
betes can develop during pregnancy and generally
resolves after the baby is delivered. This diabetic condi-tion develops during the second or third trimester ofpregnancy in about 2% of pregnancies. The condition isusually treated by diet, however, insulin injections may
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1048Diabetes mellitus"
"be required. These women who have diabetes during
pregnancy are at higher risk for developing Type II dia-betes within 5–10 years.
Diabetes can also develop as a result of pancreatic
disease, alcoholism ,malnutrition , or other severe ill-
nesses that stress the body.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
The causes of diabetes mellitus are unclear, howev-
er, there seem to be both hereditary (genetic factorspassed on in families) and environmental factorsinvolved. Research has shown that some people whodevelop diabetes have common genetic markers. In TypeI diabetes, the immune system, the body’s defense sys-tem against infection, is believed to be triggered by avirus or another microorganism to destroy the cells in thepancreas that produce insulin. In Type II diabetes, age,obesity , and family history of diabetes play a roll.
In Type II diabetes, the pancreas may produce"
"In Type II diabetes, the pancreas may produce
enough insulin, however, cells have become resistant tothe insulin produced and it may not work as effectively.Symptoms of Type II diabetes can begin so gradually thata person may not know that they have it. Early signs arelethargy extreme thirst, and frequent urination. Othersymptoms may include sudden weight loss, slow woundhealing, urinary tract infections, gum disease, or blurredvision. It is not unusual for Type II diabetes to be detect-ed while a patient is seeing a doctor about another healthconcern that is actually being caused by the yet undiag-nosed diabetes.
Individuals who are at high risk of developing Type
II diabetes mellitus include people who:
• are obese (more than 20% above their ideal body
weight)
• have a relative with diabetes mellitus
• belong to a high-risk ethnic population (African-Amer-
ican, Native American, Hispanic, or Native Hawaiian)
• have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes or have"
"• have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes or have
delivered a baby weighing more than 9 lbs (4 kg)
• have high blood pressure (140/90 mmHg or above)
• have a high density lipoprotein cholesterol level less
than or equal to 35 mg/dL and/or a triglyceride levelgreater than or equal to 250 mg/dL
• have had impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fast-
ingglucose on previous testing
Several common medications can impair the body’s
use of insulin, causing a condition known as secondarydiabetes. These medications include treatments for highblood pressure (furosemide, clonidine, and thiazide
diuretics ), drugs with hormonal activity ( oral contra-
ceptives , thyroid hormone, progestins, and glucocorti-
corids), and the anti-inflammation drug indomethacin.Several drugs that are used to treat mood disorders
(such as anxiety and depression) can also impair glucose"
"(such as anxiety and depression) can also impair glucose
absorption. These drugs include haloperidol, lithium car-bonate, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, andadrenergic agonists. Other medications that can causediabetes symptoms include isoniazid, nicotinic acid,cimetidine, and heparin.
Symptoms
Symptoms of diabetes can develop suddenly (over
days or weeks) in previously healthy children or adoles-cents, or can develop gradually (over several years) inoverweight adults over the age of 40. The classic symp-toms include feeling tired and sick, frequent urination,excessive thirst, excessive hunger, and weight loss.
Ketoacidosis, a condition due to starvation or
uncontrolled diabetes, is common in Type I diabetes.Ketones are acid compounds that form in the blood whenthe body breaks down fats and proteins. Symptomsinclude abdominal pain , vomiting, rapid breathing,"
"extreme lethargy and drowsiness. Patients with ketoaci-dosis will also have a sweet breath odor. Left untreated,this condition can lead to coma and death.
With Type II diabetes, the condition may not become
evident until the patient presents for medical treatment forsome other condition. A patient may have heart disease,chronic infections of the gums and urinary tract, blurredvision, numbness in the feet and legs, or slow-healingwounds . Women may experience genital itching .

"Diagnosis
Diabetes is suspected based on symptoms. Urine and
blood tests can be used to confirm a diagnose of diabetesbased on the amount of glucose. Urine tests can alsodetect ketones and protein in the urine that may helpdiagnose diabetes and assess how well the kidneys arefunctioning. These tests can also be used to monitor thedisease once the patient is on a standardized diet, oralmedications, or insulin.
Urine tests
Clinistix and Diastix are paper strips or dipsticks
that change color when dipped in urine. The test strip iscompared to a chart which shows the amount of glucosein the urine based on the change in color. The level ofglucose in the urine lags behind the level of glucose inthe blood. Testing the urine with a test stick, paper strip,or tablet that changes color when sugar is present is notas accurate as blood testing, however it can give a fastand simple reading.

"Ketones in the urine can be detected using similar
types of dipstick tests (Acetest or Ketostix). Ketoacidosiscan be a life-threatening situation in Type I diabetics, sohaving a quick and simple test to detect ketones canassist in establishing a diagnosis sooner.

Blood tests
FASTING GLUCOSE TEST. Blood is drawn from a vein
in the patient’s arm after a period at least eight hours whenthe patient has not eaten, usually in the morning beforebreakfast. The red blood cells are separated from the sam-ple and the amount of glucose is measured in the remain-ing plasma. A plasma level of 7.8 mmol/L (200 mg/L) orgreater can indicate diabetes. The fasting glucose test isusually repeated on another day to confirm the results.

ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST. Blood samples are
taken from a vein before and after a patient drinks a thick,sweet syrup of glucose and other sugars. In a non-diabet-ic, the level of glucose in the blood goes up immediatelyafter the drink and then decreases gradually as insulin isused by the body to metabolize, or absorb, the sugar. In adiabetic, the glucose in the blood goes up and stays highafter drinking the sweetened liquid. A plasma glucoselevel of 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) or higher at two hoursafter drinking the syrup and at one other point during thetwo-hour test period confirms the diagnosis of diabetes.

"A diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed if there are
symptoms of diabetes and a plasma glucose level of atleast 11.1 mmol/L, a fasting plasma glucose level of atleast 7 mmol/L; or a two-hour plasma glucose level of atleast 11.1 mmol/L during an oral glucose tolerance test.
Home blood glucose monitoring kits are available so
patients with diabetes can monitor their own levels. Asmall needle or lancet is used to prick the finger and adrop of blood is collected and analyzed by a monitoringdevice.

"Treatment
There is currently no cure for diabetes; the condi-
tion, however, can be managed so that patients can live arelatively normal life. Treatment of diabetes focuses ontwo goals: keeping blood glucose within normal rangeand preventing the development of long-term complica-tions. Careful monitoring of diet, exercise, and bloodglucose levels are as important as the use of insulin ororal medications in preventing complications of diabetes.
Dietary changes
Diet and moderate exercise are the first treatments"
"Dietary changes
Diet and moderate exercise are the first treatments
implemented in diabetes. For many Type II diabetics,weight loss may be an important goal in helping them tocontrol their diabetes. A well-balanced, nutritious diet pro-vides approximately 50–60% of calories from carbohy-drates, approximately 10–20% of calories from protein,and less than 30% of calories from fat. The number ofcalories required by an individual depends on their age,weight, and activity level. The calorie intake also needs tobe distributed over the course of the entire day so surges ofglucose entering the blood system are kept to a minimum.
Keeping track of the number of calories provided by
different foods can become complicated, so patients areusually advised to consult a nutritionist or dietitian. Anindividualized, easy to manage diet plan can be set up foreach patient. Both the American Diabetes Association andthe American Dietetic Association recommend diets based"
"on the use of food exchange lists. Each food exchangecontains a known amount of calories in the form of pro-tein, fat, or carbohydrate. A patient’s diet plan will consistof a certain number of exchanges from each food category(meat or protein, fruits, breads and starches, vegetables,and fats) to be eaten at meal times and as snacks. Patientshave flexibility in choosing which foods they eat as longas they stick with the number of exchanges prescribed.
For many Type II diabetics, weight loss is an impor-
tant factor in controlling their condition. The foodexchange system, along with a plan of moderate exer-
cise, can help them lose excess weight and improve theiroverall health.
Oral medications
Oral medications are available to lower blood glucose"
"in Type II diabetics. The drugs first prescribed for Type IIdiabetes are in a class of compounds called sulfonylureasand include tolbutamide, tolazamide, acetohexamide, andchlorpropamide. Newer drugs in the same class are nowavailable and include glyburide, glimeperide, and glip-izide. The way that these drugs work is not well under-stood, however, they seem to stimulate cells of the pan-creas to produce more insulin. New medications that areavailable to treat diabetes include metformin, acarbose,and troglitizone. The choice of the right medicationdepends in part on the individual patient profile. All drugshave side effects that may make them inappropriate forparticular patients. Some for example, may stimulateweight gain or cause stomach irritation, so they may not bethe best treatment for someone who is already overweightor who also has stomach ulcers. While these medicationsare an important aspect of treatment for Type II diabetes,they are not a substitute for a well planned diet"
"aspect of treatment for Type II diabetes,they are not a substitute for a well planned diet and moder-ate exercise. Oral medications are not effective for Type Idiabetes, in which the patient produces little or no insulin."
"Insulin
Patients with Type I diabetes need daily injections of
insulin to help their bodies use glucose. The amount andtype of insulin required depends on the height, weight,age, food intake, and activity level of the individual dia-betic patient. Some patients with Type II diabetes mayneed to use insulin injections if their diabetes cannot becontrolled with diet, exercise, and oral medication. Injec-tions are given subcutaneously, that is, just under theskin, using a small needle and syringe. Injection sites canbe anywhere on the body where there is looser skin,including the upper arm, abdomen, or upper thigh.
Purified human insulin is most commonly used,"
"Purified human insulin is most commonly used,
however, insulin from beef and pork sources are alsoavailable. Insulin may be given as an injection of a singledose of one type of insulin once a day. Different types ofinsulin can be mixed and given in one dose or split intotwo or more doses during a day. Patients who requiremultiple injections over the course of a day may be ableto use an insulin pump that administers small doses ofinsulin on demand. The small battery-operated pump isworn outside the body and is connected to a needle that isinserted into the abdomen. Pumps can be programmed toinject small doses of insulin at various times during theday, or the patient may be able to adjust the insulin dosesto coincide with meals and exercise.

"Regular insulin is fast-acting and starts to work within
15–30 minutes, with its peak glucose-lowering effectabout two hours after it is injected. Its effects last for aboutfour to six hours. NPH (neutral protamine Hagedorn) andLente insulin are intermediate-acting, starting to workwithin one to three hours and lasting up to 18–26 hours.Ultra-lente is a long-acting form of insulin that starts towork within four to eight hours and lasts 28–36 hours.
Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can be caused by"
"Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can be caused by
too much insulin, too little food (or eating too late tocoincide with the action of the insulin), alcohol con-sumption, or increased exercise. A patient with symp-toms of hypoglycemia may be hungry, cranky, confused,and tired. The patient may become sweaty and shaky.Left untreated, the patient can lose consciousness or havea seizure. This condition is sometimes called an insulinreaction and should be treated by giving the patientsomething sweet to eat or drink like a candy, sugar cubes,juice, or another high sugar snack.
Surgery
Transplantation of a healthy pancreas into a diabetic
patient is a successful treatment, however, this transplantis usually done only if a kidney transplant is performed atthe same time. Although a pancreas transplant is possi-ble, it is not clear if the potential benefits outweigh therisks of the surgery and drug therapy needed.
Alternative treatment

"Alternative treatment
Since diabetes can be life-threatening if not properly
managed, patients should not attempt to treat this condi-tion without medicial supervision. A variety of alterna-tive therapies can be helpful in managing the symptomsof diabetes and supporting patients with the disease.Acupuncture can help relieve the pain associated with
diabetic neuropathy by stimulation of cetain points. A
qualified practitioner should be consulted. Herbal reme-dies may also be helpful in managing diabetes. Althoughthere is no herbal substitute for insulin, some herbs mayhelp adjust blood sugar levels or manage other diabeticsymptoms. Some options include:
• fenugreek ( Trigonella foenum-graecum ) has been
shown in some studies to reduce blood insulin and glu-cose levels while also lowering cholesterol

cose levels, as well as helping to maintain healthyblood vessels

pain in the peripheral nerves (a type of diabetic neu-ropathy)
• ginkgo ( Gingko biloba ) may maintain blood flow to the
retina, helping to prevent diabetic retinopathy
Any therapy that lowers stress levels can also be use-
ful in treating diabetes by helping to reduce insulinrequirements. Among the alternative treatments that aimto lower stress are hypnotherapy ,biofeedback , and
meditation .
Prognosis
Uncontrolled diabetes is a leading cause of blind-
ness, end-stage renal disease, and limb amputations. Italso doubles the risks of heart disease and increases therisk of stroke. Eye problems including cataracts ,glau-
coma , and diabetic retinopathy are also more common in
diabetics.

"diabetics.
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a condition
where nerve endings, particularly in the legs and feetbecome less sensitive. Diabetic foot ulcers are a partic-ular problem since the patient does not feel the pain ofa blister, callous, or other minor injury. Poor blood cir-culation in the legs and feet contribute to delayedwound healing. The inability to sense pain along withthe complications of delayed wound healing can resultin minor injuries, blisters, or callouses becominginfected and difficult to treat. In cases of severe infec-tion, the infected tissue begins to break down and rotaway. The most serious consequence of this conditionis the need for amputation of toes, feet, or legs due to
severe infection.
Heart disease and kidney disease are common com-
plications of diabetes. Long-term complications mayinclude the need for kidney dialysis or a kidney trans-
plant due to kidney failure.

Babies born to diabetic mothers have an increased
risk of birth defects and distress at birth.
Prevention
Research continues on ways to prevent diabetes and
to detect those at risk for developing diabetes. While theonset of Type I diabetes is unpredictable, the risk ofdeveloping Type II diabetes can be reduced by maintain-ing ideal weight and exercising regularly. The physicaland emotional stress of surgery, illness, pregnancy, andalcoholism can increase the risks of diabetes, so main-taining a healthy lifestyle is critical to preventing theonset of Type II diabetes and preventing further compli-cations of the disease.

Definition
Diabetic foot infections are infections that can
develop in the skin, muscles, or bones of the foot as aresult of the nerve damage and poor circulation that isassociated with diabetes.
Description
People who have diabetes have a greater-than-average"
"Description
People who have diabetes have a greater-than-average
chance of developing foot infections. Because a personwho has diabetes may not feel foot pain or discomfort,
problems can remain undetected until fever , weakness, or
other signs of systemic infection appear. As a result, evenminor irritations occur more often, heal more slowly, andare more likely to result in serious health problems.
With diabetes, foot infections occur more frequently"
"With diabetes, foot infections occur more frequently
because the disease causes nervous system changes andpoor circulation. Because the nerves that control sweat-ing no longer work, the skin of the feet can become verydry and cracked, and calluses tend to occur more fre-quently and build up faster. If not trimmed regularly,these calluses can turn into open sores or ulcers. Becausediabetic nerve damage can cause a loss of sensation (neu-ropathy), if the feet are not regularly inspected, an ulcercan quickly become infected and, if not treated, mayresult in the death of tissue ( gangrene ) or amputation .
The risk of infection is greatest for people who are
over the age of 60 and for those who have one or more ofthe following:
• poorly controlled diabetes
• foot ulcers
• laser treatment for changes in the retina
• kidney or vascular disease
• loss of sensation (neuropathy)
Causes and symptoms
Bacteria can cause an infection through small cracks"
"Causes and symptoms
Bacteria can cause an infection through small cracks
(fissures) that can develop in the dry skin around the heeland on other parts of the foot or through corns, calluses,blisters, hangnails, or ulcers. If not treated, the bacterialinfection can destroy skin, tissue, and bone or spreadthroughout the body.
Common sites of diabetic foot infections include the
following:
• blisters, corns, or callouses that bleed beneath the skin
• bunions, hammertoes, or other abnormalities in the
bones of the foot
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1053Diabetic foot infections"
"KEY TERMS
Fissure —A deep crack.
Neuropathy —An abnormality of the nerves out-
side the brain and spinal cord.
Ulcer —A sore or lesion.
• scar tissue that has grown over the site of an earlier
infection
• foot ulcers caused by pressure, nerve damage, or poor
circulation (Ulcers occur most often over the ball of thefoot, on the bottom of the big toe, or on the sides of thefoot due to poorly fitting shoes.)
• injuries that tear or puncture the skin.
Diagnosis
A physician who specializes in the treatment of the
foot (podiatrist) or the doctor who normally treats thepatient’s diabetes will treat the infection. An x ray of thefoot will be taken to determine whether the bone hasbecome infected. A sample from the wound will be cul-tured to identify the organism that is causing the infec-tion so that the appropriate antibiotic can be selected.
Treatment
From the results of the culture, the appropriate"
"Treatment
From the results of the culture, the appropriate
antibiotic will be prescribed. Any dead or infected tissuewill be surgically removed and, if necessary, a castand/or special shoes may be used to protect the area. Inaddition, the patient will be instructed to keep off theirfeet. If the ulcer does not heal, the physician may per-form surgery to increase blood flow to the foot. It is alsoimportant for the patient to practice good diabetes con-trol and keep blood glucose levels from getting too high.
Alternative treatment
Acupuncture and vitamin C can boost the body’s
infection-fighting ability. A variety of other vitamins and
herbs may improve general health and diabetes control.Because diabetes is a potentially deadly disease, it can bedangerous to try alternative approaches without a doc-
tor’s approval or without consulting a trained practitionerof alternative medicine.
Prognosis
Without proper treatment, diabetic foot infections"
"Prognosis
Without proper treatment, diabetic foot infections
can lead to serious illness, gangrene, amputation, andeven death if the infection spreads throughout the body.If treated properly and the patient practices good foot
care, the prognosis is generally optimistic
Prevention
There are many things that a diabetic individual can
do to prevent the occurrence of foot infections, includingthe following:
• control blood glucose and do not allow it to get too high
• avoid smoking
• keep blood pressure and cholesterol under control
• exercise to stimulate blood flow
• keep feet clean, dry, and warm
• check your feet every day for blisters, scratches, and
skin that is hard, broken, inflamed or that feels hot orcold when touched
• after bathing, carefully dry feet and apply thin coat of
petroleum jelly or hand cream to prevent dry skin fromcracking
• use a pumice stone and emery board to trim calluses
• do not neglect an ulcer, should one develop

body becomes far too acidic.
Description

Description
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) always results from a
severe insulin deficiency. Insulin is the hormone secret-ed by the body to lower the blood sugar levels whenthey become too high. Diabetes mellitus is the diseaseresulting from the inability of the body to produce orrespond properly to insulin, required by the body toconvert glucose to energy. In childhood diabetes, DKAcomplications represent the leading cause of death ,
mostly due to the accumulation of abnormally largeamounts of fluid in the brain (cerebral edema ). DKA
combines three major features: hyperglycemia, mean-ing excessively high blood sugar kevels hyperketone-mia, meaning an overproduction of ketones by thebody; and acidosis, meaning that the blood has becometoo acidic.
Insulin deficiency is responsible for all three condi-"
"Insulin deficiency is responsible for all three condi-
tions: the body glucose goes largely unused since mostcells are unable to transport glucose into the cell withoutthe presence of insulin; this condition makes the bodyuse stored fat as an alternative source instead of theunavailable glucose for energy, a process that producesacidic ketones, which build up because they requireinsulin to be broken down. The presence of excessketones in the bloodstream in turn causes the blood tobecome more acidic than the body tissues, which createsa toxic condition.Causes and symptoms

"DKA is most commonly seen in individuals with
type I diabetes, under 19 years of age and is usuallycaused by the interruption of their insulin treatment orby acute infection or trauma. A small number of peoplewith type II diabetes also experience ketoacidosis, butthis is rare given the fact that type II diabetics still pro-duce some insulin naturally. When DKA occurs in typeII patients, it is usually caused by a decrease in foodintake and an increased insulin deficiency due to hyper-glycemia.
Some common DKA symptoms include:
• high blood sugar levels
• frequent urination (polyuria) and thirst• fatigue and lethargy
• nausea
• vomiting• abdominal pain
• fruity odor to breath
• rapid, deep breathing• muscle stiffness or aching

"•coma
Diagnosis
Diagnosis requires the demonstration of hyper-
glycemia, hyperketonemia, and acidosis. DKA is estab-lished if the patient’s urine or blood is strongly positivefor glucose and ketones. Normal glucose levels in a non-diabetic person on average range from 80–110 mg/dl. Aperson with diabetes will typically fluctuate outsidethose parameters. DKA glucose levels exceed 250 mg/dland can reach 400 to 800 mg/dL. A low serum bicarbon-ate level (usually below 15 mEq/L) is also present,indicative of acidosis.
A blood test or urinalysis can quickly determine
the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream. Teststrips are available to patients commercially can sub-merge in urine to detect the presence or concentrationof ketones.
Treatment
Ketoacidosis is treated under medical supervision
and usually in a hospital setting.
Basic treatment includes:
• administering insulin to correct the hyperglycemia and
hyperketonemia
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1055Diabetic ketoacidosis"
"• Replacing fluids intravenously lost through excessive
urination and vomiting
• Balancing electrolytes to re-establish the chemical
equilibrium of the blood and prevent potassium defi-ciency ( hypokalemia ) during treatment
• Treatment for any associated bacterial infection
Prognosis
With proper medical attention, DKA is almost
always successfully treated. The DKA mortality rate isabout 10%. Coma on admission adversely affects theprognosis. The major causes of death are circulatory col-lapse, hypokalemia, infection, and cerebral edema.
Prevention
Once diabetes has been diagnosed, prevention mea-
sures to avoid DKA include regular monitoring of bloodglucose, administration of insulin, and lifestyle mainte-nance. Glucose monitoring is especially important dur-KEY TERMS

"Diabetic neuropathy
Definition
Diabetic neuropathy is a nerve disorder caused by
diabetes mellitus . Diabetic neuropathy may be diffuse,
affecting several parts of the body, or focal, affecting aspecific nerve and part of the body.
Description
The nervous system consists of two major divisions:
the central nervous systems (CNS) which includes thebrain, the cranial nerves, and the spinal cord, and theperipheral nervous system (PNS) which includes thenerves that link the CNS with the sensory organs, mus-cles, blood vessels, and glands of the body. These periph-eral nerves are either motor, meaning that they areinvolved in motor activity such as walking, or sensory,meaning that they carry sensory information back to theCNS. The PNS also works with the CNS to regulateinvoluntary (autonomic) processes such as breathing,heartbeat, blood pressure, etc.
There are two types of diffuse diabetic neuropathy"
"There are two types of diffuse diabetic neuropathy
that affect different nervous system functions. Diffuseperipheral neuropathy primarily affects the limbs, dam-
aging the nerves of the feet and hands. Autonomic neu-ropathy is the other form of diffuse neuropathy and itaffects the heart and other internal organs.
Focal—or localized—diabetic neuropathy affects
specific nerves, most commonly in the torso, leg, or head.
Diabetic neuropathy can lead to muscular weakness,
loss of feeling or sensation, and loss of autonomic func-tions such as digestion, erection, bladder control andsweating among others.
The longer a person has diabetes, the more likely the
development of one or more forms of neuropathy.Approximately 60–70% of patients with diabetes haveneuropathy, but only about 5% will experience painfulsymptoms.

"Causes and symptoms
The exact cause of diabetic neuropathy is not
known. Researchers believe that the process of nervedamage is related to high glucose concentrations in theblood that could cause chemical changes in nerves, dis-rupting their ability to effectively send messages. Highblood glucose is also known to damage the blood vesselsthat carry oxygen and other nutrients to the nerves. Inaddition, some people may have a genetic predispositionto develop neuropathy.There is a wide range of symptoms associated with
diabetic neuropathy, and they depend on which nervesand parts of the body affected and also on the type ofneuropathy present. Some patients have very mild symp-toms, while others are severely disabled.
Common symptoms of diffuse peripheral neuropa-
thy include:
• numbness and feelings of tingling or burning
• insensitivity to pain
• needle-like jabs of pain• extreme sensitivity to touch• loss of balance and coordination
Common symptoms of diffuse autonomic neuropa-"
"Common symptoms of diffuse autonomic neuropa-
thy include:
• impaired urination and sexual function
• bladder infections• stomach disorders, due to the impaired ability of the
stomach to empty (gastric stasis)
• nausea, vomiting, bloating• dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells
• loss of appetite
Common symptoms of focal neuropathy include:
• pain in the front of a thigh• severe pain in the lower back• pain in the chest or stomach• ache behind an eye
• double vision
• paralysis on one side of the face
In severe diabetic neuropathy loss of sensation can
lead to injuries that are unnoticed, progressing to infec-tions, ulceration, and possibly amputation .
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of neuropathy is based on the symp-
toms that present during a physical exam. Pain assess-ment is usually the first step. Patients may have morethan one type of pain, and the history helps the doctordetermine whether a the pain has a neuropathic cause.
The exam may include:"
"The exam may include:
• a screening test for lost sensation
• nerve conduction studies to check the flow of electric
current through a nerve
• electromyography (EMG) to see how well muscles
respond to electrical impulses transmitted by nearbynerves.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1057Diabetic neuropathy"
"• ultrasound to show how the bladder and other parts of
the urinary tract are functioning
• sometimes a nerve biopsy may be performed.
Specialists who treat diabetic neuropathy include:
• neurologists: specialists in nervous system disorders
• urologists: specialists in urinary tract disorder
• gastroenterologists: specialists in digestive disorders
• podiatrists: specialists in caring for the feet
Treatment
Treatment of diabetic neuropathy is usually focused
on treating the symptoms associated with the neuropathyand addressing the underlying cause by improving thecontrol of blood sugar levels, which may heal the earlystages of neuropathy.
There is no cure for the permanent nerve damage
caused by neuropathy. To help control pain, the choice ofproven drug therapies has broadened during the pastdecade. Pain medication, such as the topical skin creamcapsaicin, is usually no stronger than codeine because ofthe potential for addiction with long-term use of such"
"drugs. Four main classes of drugs are available for pain
management , alone or in combination: tricyclic antide-
pressants (Imipramine, Nortriptyline), narcotic anal-
gesics (Morphine), anticonvulsants (Carbamazepine,
Gabapentin), and antiarrhythmics.KEY TERMS
Central nervous system (CNS) —Part of the ner-
vous system consisting of the brain, cranial nerves,and spinal cord. The brain is the center of higherprocesses, such as thought and emotion, and isresponsible for the coordination and control ofbodily activities and the interpretation of informa-tion from the senses. The cranial nerves and spinalcord link the brain to the peripheral nervous sys-tem.

"Glucose —The type of sugar found in the blood.
Peripheral nervous system (PNS) —One of the two
major divisions of the nervous system. PNS nerveslink the central nervous system with sensoryorgans, muscles, blood vessels, and glands.Prognosis
Early stage diabetic neuropathy can usually be
reversed with good glucose control. Once nerve damagehas occurred it cannot be reversed. The prognosis is largelydependent on the management of the underlying condition,diabetes, which may halt the progression of the neuropathyand improve symptoms. Recovery, if it occurs, is slow.
Prevention
Tight glucose control and the avoidance of alcohol
and cigarettes help protect nerves from damage.

Dialysis, kidney
Definition
Dialysis treatment replaces the function of the kid-
neys, which normally serve as the body’s natural filtra-tion system. Through the use of a blood filter and achemical solution known as dialysate, the treatmentremoves waste products and excess fluids from thebloodstream, while maintaining the proper chemical bal-ance of the blood. There are two types of dialysis treat-ment : hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.

"of maintaining the proper level of certain kidney-regulated
chemicals in the bloodstream, dialysis is the only treat-ment option available outside of kidney transplantation .
In 1996 in the United States, over 200,000 people under-went regular dialysis treatments to manage their ESRD.
Precautions
Blood pressure changes associated with hemodialy-
sis may pose a risk for patients with heart problems. Peri-toneal dialysis may be the preferred treatment option inthese cases.
Peritoneal dialysis is not recommended for patients
with abdominal adhesions or other abdominal defects,such as a hernia , that might compromise the efficiency
of the treatment. It is also not recommended for patientswho suffer frequent bouts of diverticulitis, an inflamma-tion of small pouches in the intestinal tract.

Hemodialysis is the most frequently prescribed type
of dialysis treatment in the United States. The treatmentinvolves circulating the patient’s blood outside of thebody through an extracorporeal circuit (ECC), or dialysiscircuit.

times a week, for an average of three to four hours perdialysis “run.” Specific treatment schedules depend onthe type of dialyzer used and the patient’s current physi-cal condition. While the treatment prescription and regi-men is usually overseen by a nephrologist (a doctor thatspecializes in the kidney), dialysis treatments are typical-ly administered by a nurse or patient care technician inoutpatient clinics known as dialysis centers, or in hospi-tal-based dialysis units. In-home hemodialysis treatmentis also an option for some patients, although access tothis type of treatment may be limited by financial andlifestyle factors.

"Peritoneal dialysis
In peritoneal dialysis, the patient’s peritoneum, or lin-
ing of the abdomen, acts as a blood filter. A catheter is sur-gically inserted into the patient’s abdomen. During treat-ment, the catheter is used to fill the abdominal cavity withdialysate. Waste products and excess fluids move from thepatient’s bloodstream into the dialysate solution. After awaiting period of six to 24 hours, depending on the treat-ment method used, the waste-filled dialysate is drainedfrom the abdomen, and replaced with clean dialysate.
There are three types of peritoneal dialysis:
• Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). A
continuous treatment that is self-administered andrequires no machine. The patient inserts fresh dialysatesolution into the abdominal cavity, waits four to sixhours, and removes the used solution. The solution isimmediately replaced with fresh dialysate. A bagattached to the catheter is worn under clothing.

• Intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD). This hospital-
based treatment is performed several times a week. Amachine administers and drains the dialysate solution,and sessions can take up to 24 hours.
Peritoneal dialysis is often the treatment option of
choice in infants and children, whose small size canmake vascular (through a vein) access difficult to main-tain. Peritoneal dialysis can also be done outside of aclinical setting, which is more conducive to regularschool attendance.

"Preparation
Patients are weighed immediately before and after
each hemodialysis treatment to assess their fluid reten-tion. Blood pressure and temperature are taken and thepatient is assessed for physical changes since their lastdialysis run. Regular blood tests monitor chemical andwaste levels in the blood. Prior to treatment, patients aretypically administered a dose of heparin, an anticoagu-lant that prevents blood clotting, to ensure the free flowof blood through the dialyzer and an uninterrupted dialy-sis run for the patient.
Aftercare
Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients
need to be vigilant about keeping their access sites andcatheters clean and infection-free during and betweendialysis runs.

"Dialysis is just one facet of a comprehensive treat-
ment approach for ESRD. Although dialysis treatment isvery effective in removing toxins and fluids from thebody, there are several functions of the kidney it cannotmimic, such as regulating high blood pressure and redblood cell production. Patients with ESRD need to watchtheir diet and fluid intake carefully and take medicationsas prescribed to manage their disease.
Risks
Many of the risks and side effects associated with
dialysis are a combined result of both the treatment andthe poor physical condition of the ESRD patient. Dialy-sis patients should always report side effects to theirhealthcare provider.
Anemia

"Anemia
Hematocrit (Hct) levels, a measure of red blood
cells, are typically low in ESRD patients. This deficiencyis caused by a lack of the hormone erythropoietin, whichis normally produced by the kidneys. The problem is ele-vated in hemodialysis patients, who may incur blood lossduring hemodialysis treatments. Epoetin alfa, or EPO(sold under the trade name Epogen), a hormone therapy,and intravenous or oral iron supplements are used tomanage anemia in dialysis patients.
Cramps, nausea, vomiting, and headaches
Some hemodialysis patients experience cramps and
flu-like symptoms during treatment. These can be causedby a number of factors, including the type of dialysateused, composition of the dialyzer membrane, water qual-ity in the dialysis unit, and the ultrafiltration rate of thetreatment. Adjustment of the dialysis prescription often

Hypotension
Because of the stress placed on the cardiovascular
system with regular hemodialysis treatments, patients areat risk for hypotension , a sudden drop in blood pressure.
This can often be controlled by medication and adjust-ment of the patient’s dialysis prescription.
Infection
Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients
are at risk for infection. Hemodialysis patients shouldkeep their access sites clean and watch for signs of red-ness and warmth that could indicate infection. Peritonealdialysis patients must follow the same precautions withtheir catheter. Peritonitis , an infection of the peritoneum,
causes flu-like symptoms and can disrupt dialysis treat-ments if not caught early.

As of 1997, there has only been one documented case ofHIV being transmitted in a United States dialysis unit toa staff member, and no documented cases of HIV everbeing transmitted between dialysis patients in the UnitedStates. The strict standards of infection control practiced
in modern hemodialysis units makes the chance of con-tracting one of these diseases very small.
Normal results
Puffiness in the patient related to edema , or fluid
retention, may be relieved after dialysis treatment. Thepatient’s overall sense of physical well-being may alsobe improved. Because dialysis is an ongoing treatmentprocess for many patients, a baseline for normalcy can bedifficult to gauge.

Diaper rash
Definition
Dermatitis of the buttocks, genitals, lower abdomen,
or thigh folds of an infant or toddler is commonly referredto as diaper rash.
Description
The outside layer of skin normally forms a protec-
tive barrier that prevents infection. One of the primarycauses of dermatitis in the diaper area is prolonged skincontact with wetness. Under these circumstances, naturaloils are stripped away, the outer layer of skin is damaged,and there is increased susceptibility to infection by bacte-ria or yeast.
Diaper rash is a term that covers a broad variety of
skin conditions that occur on the same area of the body.Some babies are more prone to diaper rash than others.
Causes and symptoms

"Causes and symptoms
Frequently a flat, red rash is caused by simple chaf-
ing of the diaper against tender skin, initiating a frictionrash. This type of rash is not seen in the skin folds. It maybe more pronounced around the edges of the diaper, atthe waist and leg bands. The baby generally doesn’tappear to experience much discomfort. Sometimes thechemicals or detergents in the diaper are contributingfactors and may result in contact dermatitis . These
rashes should clear up easily with proper attention.
Ignoring the condition may lead to a secondary infectionthat is more difficult to resolve.
Friction of skin against itself can cause a rash in the
baby’s skin folds, called intertrigo. This rash appears asreddened areas that may ooze and is often uncomfortablewhen the diaper is wet. Intertrigo can also be found onother areas of the body where there are deep skin foldsthat tend to trap moisture.
Seborrheic dermatitis is the diaper area equivalent"
"Seborrheic dermatitis is the diaper area equivalent
of cradle cap. It is scaly and greasy in appearance andmay be worse in the folds of the skin.
Yeast, or candidal dermatitis, is the most common
infectious cause of diaper rash. The affected areas areraised and quite red with distinct borders, and satellitelesions may occur around the edges. Yeast is part of thenormal skin flora, and is often an opportunistic invaderwhen simple diaper rash is untreated. It is particularlycommon after treatment with antibiotics , which kill the
good bacteria that normally keep the yeast population incheck. Usual treatments for diaper rash will not clear it up.Repeated or difficult to resolve episodes of yeast infectionmay warrant further medical attention, since this is some-times associated with diabetes or immune problems.
Another infectious cause of diaper rash is impetigo .
This bacterial infection is characterized by blisters thatooze and crust.

caused by bacteria, particularly impetigo. This may be atopical or oral formulation, depending on the size of thearea involved and the severity of the infection.
Over-the-counter antifungal creams, such as Lotrim-
in, are often recommended to treat a rash resulting fromyeast. If topical treatment is not effective, an oral antifun-gal may be prescribed.
Mild steroid creams, such as 0.5–1% hydrocorti-
sone, can be used for seborrheic dermatitis and some-times intertrigo. Prescription strength creams may beneeded for short-term treatment of more stubborn cases.

"Alternative treatment
Good diaper hygiene will prevent or clear up many
simple cases of diaper rash. Diapers should be checkedvery frequently and changed as soon as they are wet orsoiled. Good air circulation is also important for healthyskin. Babies should have some time without wearing adiaper, and a waterproof pad can be used to protect thebed or other surface. Rubber pants, or other occlusive fab-rics, should not be used over the diaper area. Some cloth-like disposable diapers promote better air circulation thanplastic-type diapers. It may be necessary for mothers toexperiment with diaper types to see if the baby’s skinreacts better to cloth or disposable ones. If disposable dia-pers are used, the baby’s skin may react differently to var-ious brands. If the baby is wearing cloth diapers, theyshould be washed in a mild detergent and double rinsed.
The diaper area should be cleaned with something"
"The diaper area should be cleaned with something
mild, even plain water. Some wipes contain alcohol orchemicals that can be irritating for some babies. Plainwater may be the best cleansing substance when there isa rash. Using warm water in a spray bottle (or giving aquick bath) and then lightly patting the skin dry can pro-duce less skin trauma than using wipes. In the event ofsuspected yeast, a tablespoon of cider vinegar can beadded to a cup of warm water and used as a cleansingsolution. This is dilute enough that it should not burn, butacidifies the skin pH enough to hamper the yeast growth.
Barrier ointments can be valuable to treat rashes.
Those that contain zinc oxide are especially effective.These creams and ointments protect already irritated skinfrom the additional insult of urine and stool, particularly
if the baby has diarrhea . Cornstarch powder may be
used on rashes that are moist, such as impetigo.

"Nutrition
What the baby eats can make a difference in stool fre-
quency and acidity. Typically, breast-fed babies will havefewer problems with rashes. When adding a new food tothe diet, the baby should be observed closely to seewhether rashes are produced around the baby’s mouth oranus. If this occurs, the new food should be discontinued.
Babies who are taking antibiotics are more likely to
get rashes due to yeast. To help bring the good bacterialcounts back to normal, Lactobacillus bifidus can be
added to the diet. It is available in powder form frommost health food stores.
Herbal treatment
Some herbal preparations can be useful for diaper
rash. Calendula reduces inflammation, tightens tissues,and disinfects. It has been recommended for seborrheicdermatitis as well as for general inflammation of theskin. The ointment should be applied at each diaperchange. Chickweed ointment can also be soothing forirritated skin and may be applied once or twice daily.
Prognosis"
"Prognosis
Treated appropriately, diaper rash will resolve fairly
quickly if there is no underlying health problem or skindisease.
Prevention

skin dry and healthy. Application of powders and oint-

Diaphragm (birth control)
Definition
Diaphragms are dome-shaped barrier methods of
contraception that block sperm from entering the uterus."
"contraception that block sperm from entering the uterus.
They are made of latex (rubber) and formed like a shal-low cup. Since vaginas vary in size, each patient willneed to be fitted by a doctor or nurse with a diaphragmthat conforms to the shape and contour of the vagina aswell as the strength of the muscles in the vaginal walls.Diaphragms must be used with spermicidal cream orjelly. The device should cause no discomfort, and neitherthe woman nor her partner should feel that it is there.
Purpose
The purpose of a diaphragm is to prevent access to
the womb (uterus) by the sperm and thus prevent concep-tion. The level of effectiveness is about 95%.
Precautions
Each client will undergo a physical examination and
a Pap smear. If these are normal, the physician will fit thepatient for the device and give instructions on how toinsert, remove, and clean the object. She will also betaught the signs and symptoms of potential complications.KEY TERMS"
"Dermatitis —Inflammation of the skin.Description
Prior to insertion, the inside of the dome and the rim
are covered with a thick layer (perhaps a tablespoon) of aspermicide that is compatible with the diaphragm beingused. The domed area covers the opening into the uterus(cervix) and keeps the spermicide in place. As a result,any sperm that might get under the diaphragm will bedestroyed.
Diaphragms may be inserted two to three hours prior
to intercourse, and must be left in place for six to eighthours following sexual relations. During this time thewoman may not swim, bathe, or douche, but she mayshower. If she desires to have intercourse again beforethe six to eight hours have passed, the diaphragm shouldnot be removed. Instead, an applicator full of spermicideshould be deposited into the vagina.
A diaphragm will last for a year or more. It should
be examined weekly for holes. This can be done by hold-ing it up to the light or filling it with water.
Preparation"
"Preparation
Before inserting the diaphragm, the woman should
empty her bladder and wash her hands with soap andwater. The device should be checked for leaks by fillingit with water or holding it up to the light. A spermicidaljelly is then applied to the inside and outside, and espe-cially around the rim. While standing with one foot ele-vated on a chair or step, lying down, or squatting, thewoman folds the diaphragm inward toward the middleand inserts it into the vagina as far as it will go.
Aftercare
When removed, the diaphragm should be washed
with a mild soap and water. After being dried, it can bedusted with corn starch before being returned to its con-tainer. The diaphragm should always be stored awayfrom sunlight and heat in a cool, dry place. It should notbe washed with harsh or perfumed soaps or used withperfumed powders because either of these substances candamage the diaphragm.

"Risks
Although rare, wearing the diaphragm longer than
the recommended time can result in toxic shock syn-
drome . The signs and symptoms of this serious illness
include sudden onset of high fever , vomiting, diarrhea ,
dizziness , faintness, weakness, aching muscles and
joints, and rash. The doctor must be notified immediatelyif any of these conditions appear. An allergic reaction tothe spermicide or the material from which the device is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1064Diaphragm (birth control)"
"made is also possible. Diaphragm use is also associated
with an increased risk of bladder infections.
It should be noted that the diaphragm can become
dislodged during intercourse, which could result in anunwanted pregnancy . To ensure a secure fit, a woman
should be examined for a refitting if she gains or losesmore than 10 lbs (4.5 kg), or after she gives birth.
Normal results
Consumers can expect an efficiency rate of about
95% in preventing pregnancy. Using a male condom in
conjunction with the diaphragm decreases the potentialfor pregnancy. Diaphragms provide no protection againstAIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases .

Spermicide —A substance that kills sperm.
Toxic shock syndrome —An uncommon, but poten-
tially fatal, disease that has been associated with theuse of diaphragms and vaginal tampons. The symp-toms include high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.Diarrhea"
"Definition
To most individuals, diarrhea means an increased
frequency or decreased consistency of bowel move-ments; however, the medical definition is more exactthan this. In many developed countries, the average num-ber of bowel movements is three per day. However,researchers have found that diarrhea best correlates withan increase in stool weight; stool weights above 10 oz(300 g) per day generally indicates diarrhea. This ismainly due to excess water, which normally makes up60–85% of fecal matter. In this way, true diarrhea is dis-tinguished from diseases that cause only an increase inthe number of bowel movements (hyperdefecation), orincontinence (involuntary loss of bowel contents).
Diarrhea is also classified by physicians into acute,
which lasts one to two weeks, and chronic, which contin-ues for longer than 23 weeks. Viral and bacterial infec-tions are the most common causes of acute diarrhea.
Description
In many cases, acute infectious diarrhea is a mild,"
"Description
In many cases, acute infectious diarrhea is a mild,
limited annoyance. However, worldwide acute infectiousdiarrhea has a huge impact, causing over five milliondeaths per year. While most deaths are among childrenunder five years of age in developing nations, the impact,even in developed countries, is considerable. For exam-ple, over 250,000 individuals are admitted to hospitals inthe United States each year because of one of theseepisodes. Rapid diagnosis and proper treatment can pre-vent much of the suffering associated with these devas-tating illnesses.
Chronic diarrhea also has a considerable effect on
health, as well as on social and economic well being.Patients with celiac disease , inflammatory bowel dis-
ease, and other prolonged diarrheal illnesses developnutritional deficiencies that diminish growth and immu-nity. They affect social interaction and result in the lossof many working hours.
Causes and symptoms
Diarrhea occurs because more fluid passes through"
"Causes and symptoms
Diarrhea occurs because more fluid passes through
the large intestine (colon) than that organ can absorb. Asa rule, the colon can absorb several times more fluid thanis required on a daily basis. However, when this reservecapacity is overwhelmed, diarrhea occurs.
Diarrhea is caused by infections or illnesses that
either lead to excess production of fluids or preventabsorption of fluids. Also, certain substances in the colon,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1065Diarrhea"
"such as fats and bile acids, can interfere with water
absorption and cause diarrhea. In addition, rapid passageof material through the colon can also do the same.
Symptoms related to any diarrheal illness are often
those associated with any injury to the gastrointestinaltract, such as fever , nausea, vomiting, and abdominal
pain . All or none of these may be present depending on
the disease causing the diarrhea. The number of bowelmovements can vary—up to 20 or more per day. In somepatients, blood or pus is present in the stool. Bowelmovements may be difficult to flush (float) or containundigested food material.
The most common causes of acute diarrhea are
infections (the cause of traveler’s diarrhea ),food
poisoning , and medications. Medications are a fre-
quent and often over-looked cause, especially antibi-
otics and antacids . Less often, various sugar free
foods, which sometimes contain poorly absorbablematerials, cause diarrhea.
Chronic diarrhea is frequently due to many of the"
"Chronic diarrhea is frequently due to many of the
same things that cause the shorter episodes (infections,medications, etc.); symptoms just last longer. Someinfections can become chronic. This occurs mainly withparasitic infections (such as Giardia ) or when patients
have altered immunity ( AIDS ).
The following are the more usual causes of chronic
diarrhea:
• AIDS
• colon cancer and other bowel tumors
• endocrine or hormonal abnormalities (thyroid, diabetes
mellitus , etc.)
• food allergy• inflammatory bowel disease ( Crohn’s disease and
ulcerative colitis )
• lactose intolerance• malabsorption syndromes (celiac and Whipple’s dis-
ease)
• other (alcohol, microscopic colitis, radiation, surgery)

"hard to notice, but increasing thirst, dry mouth , weak-
ness or lightheadedness (particularly if worsening onstanding), or a darkening/decrease in urination are sug-gestive. Severe dehydration leads to changes in thebody’s chemistry and could become life-threatening.Dehydration from diarrhea can result in kidney failure,neurological symptoms, arthritis, and skin problems.Diagnosis
Most cases of acute diarrhea never need diagnosis or
treatment, as many are mild and produce few problems.But patients with fever over 102°F (38.9°C), signs ofdehydration, bloody bowel movements, severe abdomi-nal pain, known immune disease, or prior use of antibi-otics need prompt medical evaluation.

"ful are stool culture and examination for parasites;
however these are often negative and a cause cannot befound in a large number of patients. The earlier cul-tures are performed, the greater the chance of obtain-ing a positive result. For those with a history of antibi-otic use in the preceding two months, stool samplesneed to be examined for the toxins that cause antibiot-
ic-associated colitis . Tests are also available to check
stool samples for microscopic amounts of blood andfor cells that indicate severe inflammation of the colon.Examination with an endoscope is sometimes helpfulin determining severity and extent of inflammation.Tests to check changes in blood chemistry (potassium,magnesium, etc.) and a complete blood count (CBC)
are also often performed.

"are also often performed.
Chronic diarrhea is quite different, and most patients
with this condition will receive some degree of testing.Many exams are the same as for an acute episode, assome infections and parasites cause both types of diar-rhea. A careful history to evaluate medication use,dietary changes, family history of illnesses, and othersymptoms is necessary. Key points in determining theseriousness of symptoms are weight loss of over 10 lb(4.5 kg), blood in the stool, and nocturnal diarrhea(symptoms that awaken the patient from sleep).
Both prescription and over-the-counter medications
can contain additives, such as lactose and sorbitol, thatwill produce diarrhea in sensitive individuals. Review ofallergies or skin changes may also point to a cause.
Social history may indicate if stress is playing a role or
identify activities which can be associated with diarrhea(for example, diarrhea that occurs in runners).

"A combination of stool, blood, and urine tests may
be needed in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea; in addi-tion a number of endoscopic and x-ray studies are fre-quently required.
Treatment
Treatment is ideally directed toward correcting the
cause; however, the first aim should be to prevent or treatdehydration and nutritional deficiencies. The type offluid and nutrient replacement will depend on whetheroral feedings can be taken and the severity of fluid loss-

"es. Oral rehydration solution (ORS) or intravenous fluids
are the choices; ORS is preferred if possible.
A physician should be notified if the patient is dehy-
drated, and if oral replacement is suggested then com-mercial (Pedialyte and others) or homemade preparationscan be used. The World Health Organization (WHO) hasprovided this easy recipe for home preparation, whichcan be taken in small frequent sips:
• Table salt—3/4 tsp• Baking powder—1 tsp
• Orange juice—1 c
• Water—1 qt (1 L)
When feasible, food intake should be continued even
in those with acute diarrhea. A physician should be con-sulted as to what type and how much food is permitted.
Anti-motility agents (loperamide, diphenoxylate)
are useful for those with chronic symptoms; their use islimited or even contraindicated in most individuals withacute diarrhea, especially in those with high fever orbloody bowel movements. They should not be takenwithout the advice of a physician.
Other treatments are available, depending on the"
"Other treatments are available, depending on the
cause of symptoms. For example, the bulk agent psylli-um helps some patients by absorbing excess fluid andsolidifying stools; cholestyramine, which binds bileacids, is effective in treating bile salt induced diarrhea.Low fat diets or more easily digestible fat is useful in
some patients. New antidiarrheal drugs that decrease
excessive secretion of fluid by the intestinal tract isanother approach for some diseases. Avoidance of med-ications or other products that are known to cause diar-rhea (such as lactose) is curative in some, but should bediscussed with a physician.
Alternative treatment
It is especially important to find the cause of diar-
rhea, since stopping diarrhea when it is the body’s way ofeliminating something foreign is not helpful and can beharmful in the long run.
One effective alternative approach to preventing and"
"One effective alternative approach to preventing and
treating diarrhea involves oral supplementation ofaspects of the normal flora in the colon with the yeastsLactobacillus acidophilus ,L. bifidus , or Saccharomyces
boulardii . In clinical settings, these “biotherapeutic”
agents have repeatedly been helpful in the resolution ofdiarrhea, especially antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Theireffectiveness is also supported by the results of aresearch study published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association in 1996.KEY TERMS

"Nutrient replacement also plays a role in preventing
and treating episodes of diarrhea. Zinc especially appearsto have an effect on the immune system, and deficiencyof this mineral can lead to chronic diarrhea. Also, zincreplacement improves growth in young patients. Plentyof fluids, especially water, should be taken by individualssuffering from diarrhea to prevent dehydration. TheBRAT diet also can be useful in helping to resolve diar-rhea. This diet limits food intake to bananas, rice, apple-sauce, and toast. These foods provide soluble and insolu-ble fiber without irritation. If the toast is slightly burnt,the charcoal can help sequester toxins and pull themfrom the body.
Acute homeopathic remedies can be very effective for
treating diarrhea especially in infants and young children.
Prognosis

most individuals in developed countries, a bout of acute,infectious diarrhea is at best uncomfortable. However, in"
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1067Diarrhea
"both industrialized and developing areas, serious compli-
cations and death can occur.
For those with chronic symptoms, an extensive num-
ber of tests are usually necessary to make a proper diag-nosis and begin treatment; a specific diagnosis is foundin 90% of patients. In some, however, no specific causeis found and only treatment with bulk agents or anti-motility agents is indicated.
Prevention
Proper hygiene and food handling techniques will
prevent many cases. Traveler’s diarrhea can be avoidedby use of Pepto-Bismol and/or antibiotics, if necessary.The most important action is to prevent the complica-tions of dehydration.

"Diets
Definition
Humans may alter their usual eating habits for many
reasons, including weight loss, disease prevention ortreatment, removing toxins from the body, or to achieve ageneral improvement in physical and mental health. Oth-ers adopt special diets for religious reasons. In the caseof some vegetarians and vegans, dietary changes aremade out of ethical concerns for the rights of animals.
Purpose
People who are moderately to severely overweight
can derive substantial health benefits from a weight-lossdiet. A weight reduction of just 10–20 (4.5–9.1 kg) canresult in reduced cholesterol levels and lower blood pres-sure. Weight-related health problems include heart dis-ease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high levels ofblood sugar and cholesterol.
In individuals who are not overweight, dietary

Description
Origins
The practice of altering diet for special reasons
has existed since antiquity. For example, Judaism hasincluded numerous dietary restrictions for thousandsof years. One ancient Jewish sect, the Essenes, is saidto have developed a primitive detoxification diet
aimed at preparing the bodies, minds, and spirits of itsmembers for the coming of a “messiah” who woulddeliver them from their Roman captors. Preventativeand therapeutic diets became quite popular during thelate twentieth century. Books promoting the latestdietary plan continue to make the bestseller lists,although not all of the information given is consideredauthoritative.
The idea of a healthful diet is to provide all of the"
"The idea of a healthful diet is to provide all of the
calories and nutrients needed by the body for optimalperformance, at the same time ensuring that neithernutritional deficiencies nor excesses occur. Diet plansthat claim to accomplish those objectives are so numer-ous they are virtually uncountable. These diets employ a
variety of approaches, including the following:
• Fixed-menu: Offers little choice to the dieter. Specifies
exactly which foods will be consumed. Easy to follow,but may be considered “boring” to some dieters.
• Formula: Replaces some or all meals with a nutritional-
ly balanced liquid formula or powder.
• Exchange-type: Allows the dieter to choose between
selected foods from each food group.
• Flexible: Doesn’t concern itself with the overall diet,
simply with one aspect such as fat or energy.
Diets may also be classified according to the types"
"simply with one aspect such as fat or energy.
Diets may also be classified according to the types
of foods they allow. For example, an omnivorous dietconsists of both animal and plant foods, whereas a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet permits no animal flesh, but doesinclude eggs, milk, and dairy products. A vegan diet is astricter form of vegetarianism in which eggs, cheese,
and other milk products are prohibited.
A third way of classifying diets is according to their
purpose: religious, weight-loss, detoxification, lifestyle-related, or aimed at prevention or treatment of a specificdisease.

"Precautions
Dieters should be cautious about plans that severely
restrict the size of food portions, or that eliminate entirefood groups from the diet. It is highly probable that theywill become discouraged and drop out of such programs.The best diet is one that can be maintained indefinitelywithout ill effects, that offers sufficient variety and bal-ance to provide everything needed for good health, andthat is considerate of personal food preferences.
Low-fat diets are not recommended for children
under the age of two. Young children need extra fat tomaintain their active, growing bodies. Fat intake may begradually reduced between the ages of two and five, afterwhich it should be limited to a maximum of 30% of totalcalories through adulthood. Saturated fat should berestricted to no more than 10% of total calories.
Weight-loss dieters should be wary of the “yo-yo”"
"Weight-loss dieters should be wary of the “yo-yo”
effect that occurs when numerous attempts are made toreduce weight using high-risk, quick-fix diets. This con-tinued “cycling” between weight loss and weight gaincan slow the basal metabolic rate and can sometimes leadto eating disorders. The dieter may become discouragedand frustrated by this success/failure cycle. The endresult of “yo-yo” dieting is that it becomes more difficultto maintain a healthy weight.
Caution should also be exercised about weight-loss
diets that require continued purchases of special prepack-aged foods. Not only do these tend to be costly and over-processed, they may also prevent dieters from learningthe food-selection and preparation skills essential tomaintenance of weight loss. Further, dieters should con-sider whether they want to carry these special foods towork, restaurants, or homes of friends.

"plans that do not include exercise , considered essential
to long-term weight management. Some diets and sup-plements may be inadvisable for patients with specialconditions or situations.
Certain fad diets purporting to be official diets of
groups such as the American Heart Association and theMayo Clinic are in no way endorsed by those institu-tions. Patients thinking of starting such a diet shouldcheck with the institution to ensure its name has not beenmisappropriated by an unscrupulous practitioner.
Side effects
A wide range of side effects (some quite serious) can
result from special diets, especially those that are nutri-tionally unbalanced. Further problems can arise if thedieter is taking high doses of dietary supplements. Foodis essential to life, and improper nutrition can result in
serious illness or death .

The actual mechanismand anatomy are quite complex, involving three distinctsegments and allowing a person to swallow even whenupside-down. Diffuse esophageal spasm describes a con-dition where the entire esophagus is spastic—along itsentire length, the muscular activity is increased anduncoordinated. The name corkscrew esophagus describesperfectly the appearance of this disorder on x rays.
X rays may reveal a slightly different appearance
and result in the designation rosary bead esophagus, butthe cause is still diffuse spasm, and the two entitiesbehave in the same way.
Causes and symptoms
The cause appears to be disruption of the complex
system of nerves that coordinates the muscular activity.The result is difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and pain
that feels like a heart attack and can involve the entire
chest, jaw, and arms."
"that feels like a heart attack and can involve the entire

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1070Diffuse esophageal spasm"
"Diagnosis
Swallowing problems usually call for esopha-
gograms. In the x ray department, the patient is given acontrast agent to drink. During swallowing, x rays recordthe passage of the agent down the esophagus and into thestomach. Instead of a straight tube with well-coordinatedwaves of contraction, the resulting x rays show awrithing organ resembling a giant corkscrew.
Another test that is used in many disorders of
esophageal motility is manometry. Pressures inside theesophagus are measured every inch or so using a balloondevice that is passed all the way down to the stomach.The result is a precise record of its activity that yields aspecific diagnosis.

"Treatment
Soft and liquid foods pass more easily than solid
pieces. Medications of several types are helpful—nifedipine, hydralazine, isoproterenol, and nitrates beingthe most successful. Several other treatments have uncer-tain results. For severe cases, relief is obtained two-thirdsof the time by cutting the muscles along the entire lengthof the esophagus. This is a major surgical procedure.
Prognosis
This condition does not go away, nor is treatment
entirely satisfactory. Patients need to be careful of whatthey eat and continue on medication if a beneficial one isfound. Fortunately, the condition does not get progres-sively worse as time passes.

DiGeorge syndrome
Definition
DiGeorge syndrome (also called congenital thymic
hypoplasia, or third and fourth pharyngeal pouch syn-drome) is a birth defect that is caused by an abnormalchromosome and affects the baby’s immune system. Thesyndrome is marked by absence or underdevelopment ofthe thymus and parathyroid glands. It is named for thepediatrician who first described it in 1965.
Description"
"Description
The prevalence of DiGeorge syndrome is debated;
the estimates range from 1:4000 to 1:6395. Becausethe symptoms caused by the chromosomal abnormalityvary somewhat from patient to patient, the syndromeprobably occurs much more often than was previouslythought. DiGeorge syndrome is sometimes describedas one of the “CATCH 22” disorders, so namedbecause of their characteristics—cardiac defects,abnormal facial features, thymus underdevelopment,cleft palate, and hypocalcemia—caused by a deletionof several genes in chromosome 22. The specific facialfeatures associated with DiGeorge syndrome includelow-set ears, wide-set eyes, a small jaw, and a shortgroove in the upper lip. The male/female ratio is 1:1.The syndrome appears to be equally common in allracial and ethnic groups.
Causes and symptoms
DiGeorge syndrome is caused either by inheritance"
"Causes and symptoms
DiGeorge syndrome is caused either by inheritance
of a defective chromosome 22 or by a new defect in chro-mosome 22 in the fetus. The type of defect that isinvolved is called deletion. A deletion occurs when thegenetic material in the chromosomes does not recombineproperly during the formation of sperm or egg cells. Thedeletion means that several genes from chromosome 22are missing in DiGeorge syndrome patients. Accordingto a 1999 study, 6% of children with DiGeorge syndromeinherited the deletion from a parent, while 94% had anew deletion. Other conditions that are associated with
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1071DiGeorge syndrome"
"DiGeorge syndrome are diabetes (a condition where the
pancreas no longer produces enough insulin) in themother and fetal alcohol syndrome (a pattern of birth
defects and learning and behavioral problems affecting
individuals whose mothers consumed alcohol duringpregnancy ).
The loss of the genes in the deleted material means
that the baby’s third and fourth pharyngeal pouches failto develop normally during the twelfth week of pregnan-cy. This developmental failure results in a completely orpartially absent thymus gland and parathyroid glands. Inaddition, 74% of fetuses with DiGeorge syndrome havesevere heart defects. The child is born with a defectiveimmune system and an abnormally low level of calciumin the blood.
These defects usually become apparent within 48
hours of birth. The infant’s heart defects may lead to heart
failure , or there may be seizures and other evidence of a
low level of calcium in the blood ( hypocalcemia ).
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome can be made by"
"Diagnosis
Diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome can be made by
ultrasound examination around the eighteenth week ofpregnancy, when abnormalities in the development of theheart or the palate can be detected. Another techniquethat is used to diagnose the syndrome before birth iscalled fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH. Thistechnique uses DNA probes from the DiGeorge regionon chromosome 22. FISH can be performed on cell sam-ples obtained by amniocentesis as early as the fourteenth
week of pregnancy. It confirms about 95% of cases ofDiGeorge syndrome.
If the mother has not had prenatal testing, the diag-
nosis of DiGeorge syndrome is sometimes suggested bythe child’s facial features at birth. In other cases, the doc-tor makes the diagnosis during heart surgery when he orshe notices the absence or abnormal location of the thy-mus gland. The diagnosis can be confirmed by bloodtests for calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormonelevels, and by the sheep cell test for immune function."
"Treatment
Hypocalcemia
Hypocalcemia in DiGeorge patients is unusually dif-
ficult to treat. Infants are usually given calcium and vita-min D by mouth. Severe cases have been treated bytransplantation of fetal thymus tissue or bone marrow.
Heart defects
Infants with life-threatening heart defects are treated
surgically.Defective immune function
Children with DiGeorge syndrome should be kept
on low-phosphorus diets and kept away from crowds or
other sources of infection. They should not be immu-nized with vaccines made from live viruses or given cor-
ticosteroids .

Prognosis
The prognosis is variable; many infants with DiGe-
orge syndrome die from overwhelming infection,seizures, or heart failure within the first year. Advancesin heart surgery indicate that the prognosis is most close-ly linked to the severity of the heart defects and the par-tial presence of the thymus gland. In most children whosurvive, the number of T cells, a type of white blood cell,in the blood rises spontaneously as they mature. Sur-vivors are likely to be mentally retarded, however, and tohave other developmental difficulties, including psychi-atric problems in later life.
Prevention
Genetic counseling is recommended for parents of
children with DiGeorge syndrome because the disordercan be detected prior to birth. Although most childrenwith DiGeorge syndrome did not inherit the chromosomedeletion from their parents, they have a 50% chance ofpassing the deletion on to their own children.

"Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking digitalis
drugs is very important. The physician will check tomake sure the medicine is working as it should and willmake any necessary changes in dosage or in instructionsfor taking the medicine.
Patients taking digitalis drugs should learn to take
their pulse and should check it regularly while undertreatment with this medicine. Changes in pulse rate,rhythm, or force could be signs of side effects.
Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly without
checking with the physician who prescribed it. Thiscould cause a serious change in heart function.
Digitalis drugs are responsible for many accidental
poisonings in children. Keep this medicine out of thereach of children.

"Be alert to the signs of overdose. Overdosing is a
serious concern with digitalis drugs, because the amountof medicine that most people need to help their heartproblems is very close to the amount that can cause prob-lems from overdose. If any of these signs of overdoseoccur, check with a physician as soon as possible:
• loss of appetite
• nausea
• vomiting

"• pain in the lower stomach
• diarrhea• extreme tiredness or weakness• extremely slow or irregular heartbeat (or fast heartbeat
in children)
• blurred vision or other vision changes
• drowsiness• confusion or depression• headache• fainting
Anyone who is taking digitalis drugs should be sure
to tell the health care professional in charge before hav-ing any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emer-gency treatment. Physicians may advise people takingdigitalis drugs to wear or carry medical identificationindicating that they are taking this medicine.
Patients need to be very careful not to accidentally
take this medicine in place of another medicine thatlooks similar. Patients who are taking other medicines
that look like their digitalis medicine should ask theirpharmacists for suggestions on how to avoid mix-ups.
Anyone who has had unusual reactions to digitalis"
"Anyone who has had unusual reactions to digitalis
drugs in the past should let his or her physician knowbefore taking the drugs again. The physician should alsobe told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives,
or other substances.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who
may become pregnant should check with their physiciansbefore using digitalis drugs.
Older people may be especially sensitive to the
effects of digitalis drugs, which may increase the chanceof overdose.
Before using digitalis drugs, people with any of the
following medical problems should make sure theirphysicians are aware of their conditions:
• heart disease
• heart rhythm problems• severe lung disease
• kidney disease
• liver disease• thyroid disease
Side effects
Side effects are rare with this medicine. Check with
a physician as soon as possible if a skin rash, hives, or
any other unusual or troublesome symptoms occur.Watch for signs of overdose.
Interactions"
"any other unusual or troublesome symptoms occur.Watch for signs of overdose.
Interactions
Digitalis drugs may interact with a number of other
medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or bothof the drugs may change or the risk of side effects maybe greater. For example:
• Taking digitalis drugs with other heart medicines,
amphetamines, or diet pills could increase the risk ofheart rhythm problems.
• Calcium channel blockers, used to treat high blood
pressure, may cause higher than usual levels of digitalisdrugs in the body that could lead to symptoms of over-dose as covered in the above section.
• Diuretics (water pills) or other medicines that lower the
amount of potassium in the body may increase the sideeffects of digitalis drugs.
• Medicines that increase the amount of potassium in the
body may raise the risk of serious heart rhythm prob-lems when taken with digitalis drugs.

"• Diarrhea medicine or cholesterol-lowering drugs such as
cholestyramine (Questran) and colestipol (Colestid) maykeep digitalis medicines from being absorbed into thebody. To prevent this problem, digitalis drugs should betaken several hours before or after taking these medicines.
The list above does not include every drug that may
interact with digitalis drugs. Be sure to check with aphysician or pharmacist before taking any other prescrip-tion or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine.
In addition, a diet high in fiber may interfere with
the effects of digitalis drugs by preventing the medicinefrom being absorbed into the body. To avoid this prob-lem, eat high fiber foods (such as bran products, wholewheat bread, and fresh fruits and vegetables) severalhours before or after taking digitalis medicine.

Dilatation and curettage
Definition
Dilatation and curettage (D & C) is a gynecological
procedure in which the lining of the uterus (endometri-um) is scraped away.
Purpose
D & C is commonly used to obtain tissue for micro-
scopic evaluation to rule out cancer . D & C may also be
used to diagnose and treat heavy menstrual bleeding, andto diagnose endometrial polyps and uterine fibroids . A
D & C can be used as a treatment as well, to removepregnancy tissue after a miscarriage , incomplete abor-
tion, or childbirth . Endometrial polyps may be removed,
and sometimes benign uterine tumors (fibroids) may bescraped away. D & C can also be used as an early abor-tion technique up to 16 weeks.
Description
D & C is usually performed under general anesthe-
sia, although local or epidural anesthesia can also beused. A local lessens risk and costs, but the woman willfeel cramping during the procedure. The type of anesthe-sia used often depends upon the reason for the D & C."

form), the doctor inserts an instrument to hold open the

"vaginal walls, and then stretches the opening of the
uterus to the vagina (the cervix) by inserting a series oftapering rods, each thicker than the previous one, or byusing other specialized instruments. This process ofopening the cervix is called dilation.
Once the cervix is dilated, the physician inserts a
spoon-shaped surgical device called a curette into theuterus. The curette is used to scrape away the uterine lin-ing. One or more small tissue samples from the lining ofthe uterus or the cervical canal are sent for analysis bymicroscope to check for abnormal cells.
Although simpler, less expensive techniques such as
a vacuum aspiration are quickly replacing the D & C as adiagnostic method, it is still often used to diagnose andtreat a number of conditions.
Preparation
Because opening the cervix can be painful, sedatives
may be given before the procedure begins. Deep breath-ing and other relaxation techniques may help easecramping during cervical dilation.
Aftercare"
"Aftercare
A woman who has had a D & C performed in a hos-
pital can usually go home the same day or the next day.Many women experience backache and mild crampsafter the procedure, and may pass small blood clots for aday or so. Vaginal staining or bleeding may continue forseveral weeks.

Diphtheria
Definition
Diphtheria is a potentially fatal, contagious disease
that usually involves the nose, throat, and air passages,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1076Diphtheria"
"but may also infect the skin. Its most striking feature is
the formation of a grayish membrane covering the tonsilsand upper part of the throat.
Description
Like many other upper respiratory diseases, diphthe-
ria is most likely to break out during the winter months.At one time it was a major childhood killer, but it is nowrare in developed countries because of widespreadimmunization. Since 1988, all confirmed cases in theUnited States have involved visitors or immigrants. Incountries that do not have routine immunization againstthis infection, the mortality rate varies from 1.5–25%.
Persons who have not been immunized may get
diphtheria at any age. The disease is spread most often bydroplets from the coughing or sneezing of an infectedperson or carrier. The incubation period is two to sevendays, with an average of three days. It is vital to seekmedical help at once when diphtheria is suspected,because treatment requires emergency measures foradults as well as children."
"Causes and symptoms
The symptoms of diphtheria are caused by toxins
produced by the diphtheria bacillus, Corynebacterium
diphtheriae (from the Greek for “rubber membrane”). In
fact, toxin production is related to infections of the bacil-lus itself with a particular bacteria virus called a phage(from bacteriophage; a virus that infects bacteria). Theintoxication destroys healthy tissue in the upper area ofthe throat around the tonsils, or in open wounds in the
skin. Fluid from the dying cells then coagulates to formthe telltale gray or grayish green membrane. Inside themembrane, the bacteria produce an exotoxin, which is apoisonous secretion that causes the life-threateningsymptoms of diphtheria. The exotoxin is carried through-out the body in the bloodstream, destroying healthy tis-sue in other parts of the body.
The most serious complications caused by the exo-
toxin are inflammations of the heart muscle ( myocardi-
tis) and damage to the nervous system. The risk of seri-"
"tis) and damage to the nervous system. The risk of seri-
ous complications is increased as the time between onsetof symptoms and the administration of antitoxin increas-es, and as the size of the membrane formed increases.The myocarditis may cause disturbances in the heartrhythm and may culminate in heart failure . The symp-
toms of nervous system involvement can include seeingdouble (diplopia), painful or difficult swallowing, andslurred speech or loss of voice, which are all indicationsof the exotoxin’s effect on nerve functions. The exotoxinmay also cause severe swelling in the neck (“bull neck”).The signs and symptoms of diphtheria vary accord-

"ing to the location of the infection:
Nasal
Nasal diphtheria produces few symptoms other than
a watery or bloody discharge. On examination, there maybe a small visible membrane in the nasal passages. Nasalinfection rarely causes complications by itself, but it is apublic health problem because it spreads the diseasemore rapidly than other forms of diphtheria.
Pharyngeal
Pharyngeal diphtheria gets its name from the phar-
ynx, which is the part of the upper throat that connectsthe mouth and nasal passages with the voice box. This isthe most common form of diphtheria, causing the charac-teristic throat membrane. The membrane often bleeds ifit is scraped or cut. It is important not to try to removethe membrane because the trauma may increase thebody’s absorption of the exotoxin. Other signs and symp-toms of pharyngeal diphtheria include mild sore throat ,
fever of 101–102°F (38.3–38.9°C), a rapid pulse, and
general body weakness.

"fever of 101–102°F (38.3–38.9°C), a rapid pulse, and

culty breathing, or lose their voice completely. Thedevelopment of a “bull neck” indicates a high level ofexotoxin in the bloodstream. Obstruction of the airwaymay result in respiratory compromise and death .

"Skin
This form of diphtheria, which is sometimes called
cutaneous diphtheria, accounts for about 33% of diphthe-ria cases. It is found chiefly among people with poorhygiene. Any break in the skin can become infected withdiphtheria. The infected tissue develops an ulcerated areaand a diphtheria membrane may form over the wound butis not always present. The wound or ulcer is slow to healand may be numb or insensitive when touched.
Diagnosis
Because diphtheria must be treated as quickly as
possible, doctors usually make the diagnosis on the basisof the visible symptoms without waiting for test results.
In making the diagnosis, the doctor examines the
patient’s eyes, ears, nose, and throat in order to rule out
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1077Diphtheria"
"other diseases that may cause fever and sore throat, such
as infectious mononucleosis , a sinus infection, or strep
throat . The most important single symptom that sug-
gests diphtheria is the membrane. When a patient devel-ops skin infections during an outbreak of diphtheria, thedoctor will consider the possibility of cutaneous diphthe-ria and take a smear to confirm the diagnosis.
Laboratory tests
The diagnosis of diphtheria can be confirmed by the
results of a culture obtained from the infected area. Mater-ial from the swab is put on a microscope slide and stainedusing a procedure called Gram’s stain. The diphtheriabacillus is called Gram-positive because it holds the dyeafter the slide is rinsed with alcohol. Under the micro-scope, diphtheria bacilli look like beaded rod-shaped cells,grouped in patterns that resemble Chinese characters.Another laboratory test involves growing the diphtheriabacillus on a special material called Loeffler’s medium.
Treatment"
"Treatment
Diphtheria is a serious disease requiring hospital
treatment in an intensive care unit if the patient hasdeveloped respiratory symptoms. Treatment includes acombination of medications and supportive care:
Antitoxin
The most important step is prompt administration of
diphtheria antitoxin, without waiting for laboratoryresults. The antitoxin is made from horse serum andworks by neutralizing any circulating exotoxin. The doc-tor must first test the patient for sensitivity to animalserum. Patients who are sensitive (about 10%) must bedesensitized with diluted antitoxin, since the antitoxin isthe only specific substance that will counteract diphthe-ria exotoxin. No human antitoxin is available for thetreatment of diphtheria.
The dose ranges from 20,000–100,000 units,
depending on the severity and length of time of symp-toms occurring before treatment. Diphtheria antitoxin isusually given intravenously.
Antibiotics

"Antibiotics
Antibiotics are given to wipe out the bacteria, to
prevent the spread of the disease, and to protect thepatient from developing pneumonia . They are not a sub-
stitute for treatment with antitoxin. Both adults and chil-dren may be given penicillin, ampicillin, or ery-thromycin. Erythromycin appears to be more effectivethan penicillin in treating people who are carriersbecause of better penetration into the infected area.Cutaneous diphtheria is usually treated by cleansing
the wound thoroughly with soap and water, and givingthe patient antibiotics for 10 days.
Supportive care
Diphtheria patients need bed rest with intensive
nursing care, including extra fluids, oxygenation, andmonitoring for possible heart problems, airway blockage,or involvement of the nervous system. Patients withlaryngeal diphtheria are kept in a croup tent or high-
humidity environment; they may also need throat suc-tioning or emergency surgery if their airway is blocked."
"Patients recovering from diphtheria should rest at
home for a minimum of two to three weeks, especially ifthey have heart complications. In addition, patientsshould be immunized against diphtheria after recovery,because having the disease does not always induce anti-toxin formation and protect them from reinfection.
Prevention of complications
Diphtheria patients who develop myocarditis may be
treated with oxygen and with medications to preventirregular heart rhythms. An artificial pacemaker may beneeded. Patients with difficulty swallowing can be fedthrough a tube inserted into the stomach through thenose. Patients who cannot breathe are usually put onmechanical respirators.
Prognosis
The prognosis depends on the size and location of
the membrane and on early treatment with antitoxin; thelonger the delay, the higher the death rate. The most vul-nerable patients are children under age 15 and those whodevelop pneumonia or myocarditis. Nasal and cutaneousdiphtheria are rarely fatal."
"Prevention
Prevention of diphtheria has four aspects:
Immunization
Universal immunization is the most effective means
of preventing diphtheria. The standard course of immu-nization for healthy children is three doses of DPT(diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) preparation given betweentwo months and six months of age, with booster dosesgiven at 18 months and at entry into school. Adultsshould be immunized at 10 year intervals with Td(tetanus-diphtheria) toxoid. A toxoid is a bacterial toxinthat is treated to make it harmless but still can induceimmunity to the disease.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1078Diphtheria"
"Isolation of patients
Diphtheria patients must be isolated for one to
seven days or until two successive cultures show thatthey are no longer contagious. Children placed in isola-
tion are usually assigned a primary nurse for emotional
support.
Identification and treatment of contacts
Because diphtheria is highly contagious and has a
short incubation period, family members and other con-tacts of diphtheria patients must be watched for symp-toms and tested to see if they are carriers. They are usual-ly given antibiotics for seven days and a booster shot ofdiphtheria/tetanus toxoid.
Reporting cases to public health authorities
Reporting is necessary to track potential epidemics,
to help doctors identify the specific strain of diphtheria,and to see if resistance to penicillin or erythromycin hasdeveloped.KEY TERMS

Discoid lupus erythematosus
Definition
Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a disease in
which coin-shaped (discoid) red bumps appear on the skin.
Description
The disease called discoid lupus erythematosus only
affects the skin, although similar discoid skin lesions can
occur in the serious disease called systemic lupus ery-
thematosus (SLE). Only about 10% of all patients with
DLE will go on to develop the multi-organ disease SLE.
The tendency to develop DLE seems to run in fami-
lies. Although men or women of any age can developDLE, it occurs in women three times more frequently thanin men. The typical DLE patient is a woman in her 30s.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1079Discoid lupus erythematosus"
"Causes and symptoms
The cause of DLE is unknown. It is thought that
DLE (like SLE) may be an autoimmune disorder.Autoimmune disorders are those that occur when cells
of the immune system are misdirected against the body.Normally, immune cells work to recognize and helpdestroy foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, and fungi.In autoimmune disorders, these cells mistakenly recog-nize various tissues of the body as foreign invaders, andattack and destroy these tissues. In SLE, the misdirectedimmune cells are antibodies. In DLE, the damaging cellsare believed to be a type of white blood cell called a Tlymphocyte. The injury to the skin results in inflamma-tion and the characteristic discoid lesions.
In DLE, the characteristic skin lesion is circular and
raised. The reddish rash is about 5–10 mm in diameter,with the center often somewhat scaly and lighter in colorthan the darker outer ring. The surface of these lesions issometimes described as “warty.” There is rarely any itch-"
"ingor pain associated with discoid lesions. They tend to
appear on the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, back, andarms. As DLE lesions heal, they leave thickened, scarredareas of skin. When the scalp is severely affected, theremay be associated hair loss ( alopecia ).
People with DLE tend to be quite sensitive to the
sun. They are more likely to get a sunburn , and the sun
is likely to worsen their discoid lesions.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of DLE usually requires a skin biopsy . A
small sample of a discoid lesion is removed, speciallyprepared, and examined under a microscope. Usually, thelesion has certain microscopic characteristics that allow itto be identified as a DLE lesion. Blood tests will notreveal the type of antibodies present in SLE, and physical
examination usually does not reveal anything other than
the skin lesions. If antibodies exist in the blood, or if othersymptoms or physical signs are found, it is possible thatthe discoid lesions are a sign of SLE rather than DLE."
"Treatment
Treatment of DLE primarily involves the use of a
variety of skin creams. Sunscreens are used for protec-
tion. Steroid creams can be applied to decrease inflamma-tion. Occasionally, small amounts of a steroid preparationwill be injected with a needle into a specific lesion.Because of their long list of side effects, steroid prepara-tions taken by mouth are avoided. Sometimes, short-termtreatment with oral steroids will be used for particularlysevere DLE outbreaks. Medications used to treat theinfectious disease malaria are often used to treat DLE.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for DLE include eating a
healthy diet, low in red meat and dairy products and highin fish containing omega-3 fatty acids. These types offish include mackerel, sardines, and salmon. Following ahealthy diet is thought to decrease inflammation. Dietarysupplements believed to be helpful include vitamins B,"
"C, E, and selenium. Vitamin A is also recommended toimprove DLE lesions. Constitutional homeopathic treat-ment can help heal DLE as well as help prevent it devel-oping into SLE.
Prognosis
For the most part, the prognosis for people with
DLE is excellent. While the lesions may be cosmeticallyunsightly, they are not life threatening and usually do notcause a patient to change his or her lifestyle. Only about10% of patients with DLE will go on to develop SLE.
Prevention
DLE cannot be prevented. Recommendations to pre-
vent flares of DLE in patients with the disease includeavoiding exposure to sun and consistently using sun-screen.

Disk removal
Definition
One of the most common types of back surgery is
disk removal (diskectomy), the removal of an interverte-bral disk, the flexible plate that connects any two adja-cent vertebrae in the spine. Intervertebral disks act asshock absorbers, protecting the brain and spinal cord"
"from the impact produced by the body’s movements.
Purpose
About 150,000 Americans undergo disk removal
each year in the United States. Removing the invertebralKEY TERMS
Antibody —Specialized cells of the immune sys-
tem that can recognize organisms invading thebody (like bacteria, viruses, and fungi). The anti-bodies are then able to start a complex chain ofevents designed to kill these foreign invaders.
Autoimmune disorder —A disorder in which the
body’s antibodies mistake the body’s own tissuesfor foreign invaders. The immune system thenattacks and causes damage to these tissues.
Immune system —The system of specialized organs,
lymph nodes, and blood cells throughout the bodythat work together to defend the body against for-eign invaders (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.).disk is performed to treat back pain that has lasted at least"
"six weeks as a result of an abnormal disk and that has notresponded to conservative treatment. Surgery is also per-formed if there is pressure on the lumbosacral nerve rootsthat causes weakness or bowel or bladder disfunction.
As a person ages, the disks between the vertebrae
degenerate and dry out, and the fibers holding them inplace tear. Eventually, the disk can form a blister-likebulge, compressing nerves in the spine and causing pain.This is called a “prolapsed” (or herniated) disk. If such adisk causes muscle weakness or interferes with bladderor bowel function because it is pressing on a nerve root,immediate surgery to remove the disk may be needed.

"The aim of the surgery is to try to relieve all pressure
on nerve roots by removing the pulpy material from thedisk, or the disk itself. If it is necessary to remove materi-al from several nearby vertebrae, the spine may becomeunsteady. In this case, the surgeon will perform a spinalfusion, removing all the disks between two or more verte-brae and roughening the bones so that the vertebrae healtogether. Bone strips taken from the patient’s leg or hipmay be used to help hold the vertebrae together. Spinalfusion decreases pain but it also decreases spinal mobility.
Precautions
The doctor will obtain x rays, neuroimaging stud-
ies, including computed tomography scan (CT scan)myelogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
and clinical exams to determine the precise location ofthe affected disk.

"Description
The surgery is done under general anaesthesia,
which puts the patient to sleep and affects the wholebody. Operating on the patient’s back, the neurosurgeonor orthopedic surgeon makes an opening into the verte-bral canal, and then moves the dura and the bundle ofnerves called the “cauda equina” (horse’s tail) aside,which exposes the disk. If a portion of the disk hasmoved from between the vertebrae out into the nervecanal, it is simply removed. If the disk itself has becomefragmented and partially displaced, or not fragmentedbut bulging extensively, the surgeon will remove thebulging or displaced part of the disk and the part that liesin the space between the vertebrae.
Preparation
The patient is given an injection an hour before the
surgery to dry up internal fluids and encourage drowsi-ness.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1081Disk removal"
"Aftercare
After the operation, the patient will awaken lying
flat and face down, and must remain this way for severaldays, changing position only to avoid bedsores . There
maybe slight pain or stiffness in the back area.
Patients should sleep on a firm mattress and avoid
bending at the waist, lifting heavy weights, or sitting inone spot for a long time (such as riding in a car).
After surgery, patients can usually leave the hospital
on the fourth or fifth day. They must:
• avoid sitting for more than 15–20 minutes
• use a reclined chair• avoid bending, twisting, or lifting• begin gentle walking (indoors or outdoors), gradually
increasing
• begin stationary biking or gentle swimming after two
weeks
• continue exercise for the next four weeks
• slow down if they experience more than minor pain in
the back or leg

Dislocations and subluxations
Definition
In medicine, the terms dislocation and subluxation
refer to the displacement of bones that form a joint.These conditions affecting the joint most often resultfrom trauma that causes adjoining bones to no longeralign with each other. A partial or incomplete dislocationis called a subluxation.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1082Dislocations and subluxations"
"Description
In a healthy joint, the bones are normally held
together with tough, fibrous bands called ligaments.These ligaments are attached to each bone along with afibrous sac surrounding the joint called the articular cap-sule or joint capsule. The ligaments and joint capsule arerelatively strong and nonelastic but permit movementwithin normal limits for each particular joint. In the eventof a dislocation, one of the bones making up the joint isforced out of its natural alignment from excessivestretching and tearing of the joint ligaments and capsule.Muscles and tendons surrounding the joint are usuallystretched and injured to some degree.

"Causes and symptoms
A violent movement at the joint that exceeds normal
limits usually causes a joint dislocation. Although dislo-cations often result from trauma, they sometimes occuras a result of disease affecting the joint structures. In theprocess of the dislocation, there is tearing of the liga-ments and the articular capsule, which are vital structuresfor connecting the bone. Following a dislocation, thebones affected are often immobile and the affected limbmay be locked in an abnormal position; fractures are
also a concern with severe dislocations.
Important factors in recognizing a dislocation or"
"also a concern with severe dislocations.
Important factors in recognizing a dislocation or
subluxation include a history of experiencing a fall orreceiving a blow in a particular joint followed by the sud-den onset of loss of function to the involved limb. Imme-diately after the dislocation, the joint almost alwaysswells significantly and feels painful when pressure isapplied (point tenderness). If trauma to the joint causingthe dislocation or subluxation is violent in nature, smallchips of bone can be torn away with the supporting struc-tures. Chronic recurrent dislocations may take placewithout severe pain because of the somewhat slack con-"
"dition of the surrounding muscles and other supportingtissues. A first-time dislocation is considered and treatedas a possible fracture. Risk factors that can increase sus-ceptibility of joint dislocation and subluxation are shal-low or abnormally formed joint surfaces present at birth(congenital) and/or other diseases of ligaments and tissuearound a joint. Some infants are born with a hip disloca-tion. Both sexes and all ages are affected.
Diagnosis
A thorough medical history and physical exam by a
physician is the first step in the correct diagnosis of dis-locations and subluxations. X rays of the joint and adja-cent bones can locate and help determine the extent ofdislocated jointsTreatment
Immediately after the dislocation, the application of
ice is helpful to control swelling and decrease pain. If thepatient needs to be transported, it is important to preventthe joint from moving ( immobilization ). At times, a cast"
"or splint may be used to immobilize the joint and ensureproper alignment and healing. The treatment of realign-ing bones following a dislocation is called reduction.This may include simple maneuvers that manipulate thejoint to reposition the bones or surgical procedures torestore the joint to its normal position. A general anesthe-sia or muscle relaxant may be used to help make jointreduction possible by relaxing surrounding muscles inspasm. Acetaminophen or aspirin are sometimes used
to control moderate pain, and narcotics may be pre-scribed by the physician if the pain is severe. Recurringdislocation may require surgical reconstruction orreplacement of the joint. It is not recommended toattempt to reset a dislocated joint outside of a medical

"environment with experienced medical personnel,
because a fracture may be present.
Alternative treatment
Chiropractic care has been shown to be effective
for joint subluxation and dislocation, especially in thespine. Swelling can be addressed using botanical thera-pies. Bromelain, a pineapple enzyme, and tumeric ( Cur-
cuma longa ) are the most potent botanical remedies for
this purpose. Acute homeopathic care with arnica ( Arni-
ca montana ) can reduce the trauma to the body. Liga-
ment and tendon strengthening can be assisted bothbotanically and homeopathically.
Prognosis
Joint ligaments have poor blood supply and, there-
fore, heal slowly. This healing process continues longafter the symptoms of the dislocation injury havediminished. Once a joint has been either subluxated orcompletely dislocated, the connective tissue binding orholding it in correct alignment is stretched to such an"
"extent that the joint becomes extremely vulnerable torepeated dislocations. However, this chance of recur-rent dislocation and subluxation will decrease if aproper rehabilitation program is implemented to
strengthen surrounding muscles of the joint. Most jointdislocations are curable with prompt treatment. Afterthe dislocation has been corrected, the joint mayrequire immobilization with a cast or sling for two toeight weeks.
Prevention
When an individual is involved in strenuous
sports or heavy work, involved joints may be protect-ed by elastic bandage wraps, tape wraps, knee andshoulder pads, or special support stockings. Keepingthe muscles surrounding the joint strong will alsohelp prevent dislocations. Long-term problems mayalso be prevented by allowing an adequate amount oftime for an injured joint to rest and heal prior toresuming full activity.

In order to have a clear picture of these disorders,
dissociation should first be understood. Dissociation is amechanism that allows the mind to separate or compart-mentalize certain memories or thoughts from normalconsciousness. These split-off mental contents are noterased. They may resurface spontaneously or be trig-gered by objects or events in the person’s environment.

"Dissociation is a process that occurs along a spec-
trum of severity. It does not necessarily mean that a per-son has a dissociative disorder or other mental illness. Amild degree of dissociation occurs with some physicalstressors; people who have gone without sleep for a longperiod of time, have had “laughing gas” for dentalsurgery, or have been in a minor accident often havebrief dissociative experiences. Another commonplaceexample of dissociation is a person becoming involvedin a book or movie so completely that the surroundingsor the passage of time are not noticed. Another examplemight be driving on the highway and taking several exitswithout noticing or remembering. Dissociation is relatedto hypnosis in that hypnotic trance also involves a tem-porarily altered state of consciousness. Most patientswith dissociative disorders are highly hypnotizable.

experiences in the course of religious (in certain trancestates) or other group activities. These occurrencesshould not be judged in terms of what is considered “nor-mal” in the United States.

bat, criminal attacks, brainwashing in hostage situations,or involvement in a natural or transportation disaster.Patients with acute stress disorder ,post-traumatic

"stress disorder (PTSD), or conversion disorder and
somatization disorder may develop dissociative symp-toms. Recent studies of trauma indicate that the humanbrain stores traumatic memories in a different way thannormal memories. Traumatic memories are notprocessed or integrated into a person’s ongoing life inthe same fashion as normal memories. Instead they aredissociated, or “split off,” and may erupt into conscious-ness from time to time without warning. The affectedperson cannot control or “edit” these memories. Over aperiod of time, these two sets of memories, the normaland the traumatic, may coexist as parallel sets withoutbeing combined or blended. In extreme cases, differentsets of dissociated memories may alter subpersonalitiesof patients with dissociative identity disorder ( multiple

Dissociative amnesia
Dissociative amnesia is a disorder in which the
distinctive feature is the patient’s inability to remem-ber important personal information to a degree thatcannot be explained by normal forgetfulness. In manycases, it is a reaction to a traumatic accident or wit-nessing a violent crime.

DDNOS is a diagnostic category ascribed to patients

The moderate to severe dissociation that occurs in
patients with dissociative disorders is understood toresult from a set of causes:
• an innate ability to dissociate easily
• repeated episodes of severe physical or sexual abuse in
childhood
• the lack of a supportive or comforting person to coun-
teract abusive relative(s)
• the influence of other relatives with dissociative symp-
toms or disorders
The relationship of dissociative disorders to child-"
"toms or disorders
The relationship of dissociative disorders to child-
hood abuse has led to intense controversy and lawsuitsconcerning the accuracy of childhood memories. Thebrain’s storage, retrieval, and interpretation of memoriesare still not fully understood. Controversy also existsregarding how much individuals presenting dissociativedisorders have been influenced by books and movies todescribe a certain set of symptoms (scripting).
The major dissociative symptoms are:
Amnesia
Amnesia in a dissociative disorder is marked by
gaps in a patient’s memory for long periods of time or fortraumatic events. Doctors can distinguish this type ofamnesia from loss of memory caused by head injuries ordrug intoxication, because the amnesia is “spotty” andrelated to highly charged events and feelings.

"Depersonalization
Depersonalization is a dissociative symptom in
which the patient feels that his or her body is unreal, ischanging, or is dissolving. Some patients experiencedepersonalization as being outside their bodies or watch-ing a movie of themselves.
Derealization
Derealization is a dissociative symptom in which the
external environment is perceived as unreal. The patientmay see walls, buildings, or other objects as changing inshape, size, or color. In some cases, the patient may feelthat other persons are machines or robots, though thepatient is able to acknowledge the unreality of this feeling.
Identity disturbances
Patients with dissociative fugue, DDNOS, or DID
often experience confusion about their identities oreven assume new identities. Identity disturbances resultfrom the patient having split off entire personality traits
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1086Dissociative disorders"
"or characteristics as well as memories. When a stressful
or traumatic experience triggers the reemergence ofthese dissociated parts, the patient may act differently,answer to a different name, or appear confused by his orher surroundings.
Diagnosis
When a doctor is evaluating a patient with dissocia-
tive symptoms, he or she will first rule out physical con-ditions that sometimes produce amnesia, depersonaliza-tion, or derealization. These physical conditions includeepilepsy, head injuries, brain disease, side effects of med-ications, substance abuse, intoxication, AIDS, dementia
complex, or recent periods of extreme physical stress
and sleeplessness. In some cases, the doctor may give thepatient an electroencephalogram (EEG) to excludeepilepsy or other seizure disorders.
If the patient appears to be physically normal, the
doctor will rule out psychotic disturbances, includingschizophrenia . In addition, doctors can use some psy-"
"chological tests to narrow the diagnosis. One is a screen-
er, the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). If thepatient has a high score on this test, he or she can be eval-uated further with the Dissociative Disorders InterviewSchedule (DDIS) or the Structured Clinical Interview forDSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D). It is also pos-
sible for doctors to measure a patient’s hypnotizability aspart of a diagnostic evaluation.
Treatment
Treatment of the dissociative disorders often com-
bines several methods.
Psychotherapy
Patients with dissociative disorders often require
treatment by a therapist with some specialized under-standing of dissociation. This background is particularlyimportant if the patient’s symptoms include identityproblems. Many patients with dissociative disorders arehelped by group as well as individual treatment.

Diuretics
Definition
Diuretics are medicines that help reduce the amount
of water in the body.
Purpose
Diuretics are used to treat the buildup of excess fluid
in the body that occurs with some medical conditionssuch as congestive heart failure , liver disease, and kid-"
"ney disease. Some diuretics are also prescribed to treathigh blood pressure. These drugs act on the kidneys toincrease urine output. This reduces the amount of fluid inthe bloodstream, which in turn lowers blood pressure.
Description
There are several types of diuretics, also called water
pills:
• Loop diuretics, such as bumetanide (Bumex) and
furosemide (Lasix), get their name from the loop-shaped part of the kidneys where they have their effect.
• Thiazide diuretics include such commonly used diuret-
ics as hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIURIL, Esidrix),chlorothiazide (Diuril), and chlorthalidone (Hygroton).
• Potassium-sparing diuretics prevent the loss of potassi-
um, which is a problem with other types of diuretics.Examples of potassium-sparing diuretics are amiloride(Midamor) and triamterene (Dyrenium).
In addition, some medicines contain combinations"
"In addition, some medicines contain combinations
of two diuretics. The brands Dyazide and Maxzide, forexample, contain the thiazide diuretic hydrochloroth-iazide with the potassium-sparing diuretic triamterene.
Some nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines
contain diuretics. However, the medicines describedhere cannot be bought without a physician’s prescrip-tion. They are available in tablet, capsule, liquid, andinjectable forms.
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
diuretic and may be different for different patients.Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or thepharmacist who filled the prescription for the correctdosage, and take the medicine exactly as directed.
Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking a diuretic
is important. The physician will check to make sure themedicine is working as it should and will watch forunwanted side effects.

"Some people feel unusually tired when they first
start taking diuretics. This effect usually becomes lessnoticeable over time, as the body adjusts to the medicine.
Because diuretics increase urine output, people who
take this medicine may need to urinate more often, evenduring the night. Health care professionals can helppatients schedule their doses to avoid interfering withtheir sleep or regular activities.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1088Diuretics"
"For patients taking the kinds of diuretics that rob
potassium from the body, physicians may recommendadding potassium-rich foods or drinks, such as citrus fruitsand juices, to the diet. Or they may suggest taking a potas-sium supplement or taking another medicine that keeps thebody from losing too much potassium. If the physicianrecommends any of these measures, be sure to closely fol-low his or her directions. Do not make other diet changeswithout checking with the physician. People who are tak-ing potassium-sparing diuretics should not add potassiumto their diets , as too much potassium may be harmful.
People who take diuretics may lose too much water
or potassium when they get sick, especially if they havesevere vomiting and diarrhea . They should check with

"their physicians if they become ill.
These medicines make some people feel lighthead-
ed, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting or lyingdown. Older people are especially likely to have thisproblem. Drinking alcohol, exercising, standing for longperiods, or being in hot weather may make the problemworse. To lessen the problem, get up gradually and holdonto something for support if possible. Avoid drinkingtoo much alcohol and be careful in hot weather or whenexercising or standing for a long time.
Anyone who is taking a diuretic should be sure to
tell the health care professional in charge before havingsurgical or dental procedures, medical tests or emergencytreatment.

"burn ,itching , a rash, redness, or other changes in skin
color. While being treated with this medicine, avoidbeing in direct sunlight, especially between 10 a.m. and 3p.m.; wear a hat and tightly woven clothing that coversthe arms and legs; use a sunscreen with a skin protectionfactor (SPF) of at least 15; protect the lips with a sunblock lipstick; and do not use tanning beds, tanningbooths, or sunlamps. People with fair skin may need touse a sunscreen with a higher skin protection factor.
Special conditions
People who have certain medical conditions or who
are taking certain other medicines may have problems ifthey take diuretics. Before taking these drugs, be sure tolet the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reac-
tions to diuretics or sulfonamides (sulfa drugs) in the
past should let his or her physician know before usinga diuretic. The physician should also be told about anyallergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other sub-"
"stances.PREGNANCY. Diuretics will not help the swelling of
hands and feet that some women have duringpregnancy . In general, pregnant women should not use
diuretics unless a physician recommends their use.Although studies have not been done on pregnantwomen, studies of laboratory animals show that somediuretics can cause harmful effects when taken duringpregnancy.
BREASTFEEDING. Some diuretics pass into breast
milk, but no reports exist of problems in nursing babieswhose mothers use this medicine. However, thiazidediuretics may decrease the flow of breast milk. Womenwho are breastfeeding and need to use a diuretic shouldcheck with their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Side effects of
some diuretics may be more likely in people who havehad a recent heart attack or who have liver disease or"
"severe kidney disease. Other diuretics may not workproperly in people with liver disease or severe kidneydisease. Diuretics may worsen certain medical condi-tions, such as gout ,kidney stones ,pancreatitis , lupus
erythematosus, and hearing problems. In addition, peo-ple with diabetes should be aware that diuretics mayincrease blood sugar levels. People with heart or bloodvessel disease should know that some diuretics increasecholesterol or triglyceride levels. The risk of an allergicreaction to certain diuretics is greater in people withbronchial asthma . Before using diuretics, people with
any of these medical problems should make sure theirphysicians are aware of their conditions. Also, peoplewho have trouble urinating or who have high potassiumlevels in their blood may not be able to take diuretics andshould check with a physician before using them.

usually lessen or go away as the body adjusts to the med-icine. These problems do not need medical attentionunless they continue or interfere with normal activities.
Patients taking potassium-sparing diuretics should
know the signs of too much potassium and should checkwith a physician as soon as possible if any of these symp-toms occur:

Interactions
Diuretics may interact with other medicines. When
this happens, the effects of one or both of the drugs maychange or the risk of side effects may be greater. Anyonewho takes a diuretic should let the physician know allother medicines he or she is taking and should ask whetherthe possible interactions can interfere with drug therapy.Among the drugs that may interact with diuretics are:KEY TERMS

Diverticulosis and
diverticulitis
Definition
Diverticulosis refers to a condition in which the
inner, lining layer of the large intestine (colon) bulges
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1090Diverticulosis and diverticulitis"
"out (herniates) through the outer, muscular layer. These
outpouchings are called diverticula. Diverticulitis refersto the development of inflammation and infection in oneor more diverticula.
Description
Diverticula tend to occur most frequently in the
last segment of the large intestine, the sigmoid colon.They occur with decreasing frequency as one examinesfurther back toward the beginning of the large intes-tine. The chance of developing diverticula increaseswith age, so that by the age of 50, about 20–50% of allpeople will have some diverticula. By the age of 90,virtually everyone will have developed some diverticu-la. Most diverticula measure about 3 mm to just over 3cm in diameter. Larger diverticula, termed giant diver-ticula, are quite infrequent, but may measure as largeas 15 cm in diameter.
Causes and symptoms
Diverticula are believed to be caused by overly"
"Causes and symptoms
Diverticula are believed to be caused by overly
forceful contractions of the muscular wall of the largeintestine. As areas of this wall spasm, they become weak-er and weaker, allowing the inner lining to bulge through.The anatomically weakest areas of the intestinal walloccur next to blood vessels which course through thewall, so diverticula commonly occur in this location.
Diverticula are most common in the developed
countries of the West (North America, Great Britain,northern and western Europe). This is thought to be dueto the diet of these countries, which tends to be quite lowin fiber. A diet low in fiber results in the production ofsmaller volumes of stool. In order to move this smallerstool along the colon and out of the rectum, the colonmust narrow itself significantly, and does so by contract-ing down forcefully. This causes an increase in pressure,which, over time, weakens the muscular wall of the intes-tine and allows diverticular pockets to develop."
"The origin of giant diverticula development is not
completely understood, although one theory involves gasrepeatedly entering and becoming trapped in an already-existing diverticulum, causing stretching and expansionof that diverticulum.
The great majority of people with diverticulosis will
remain symptom-free. Many diverticula are quite acci-dentally discovered during examinations for other condi-tions of the intestinal tract.
Some people with diverticulosis have symptoms such
as constipation , cramping, and bloating. It is unclear
whether these symptoms are actually caused by the diver-ticula themselves, or whether some other gastrointestinalcondition (such as irritable bowel syndrome ) might be"
"responsible. A complication of diverticulosis occursbecause many diverticula develop in areas very nearblood vessels. Therefore, one serious risk of diverticulosisinvolves bleeding. Although an infrequent complication,the bleeding can be quite severe. Seventy-five percent ofsuch bleeding episodes occur due to diverticula located onthe right side of the colon. About 50% of the time, suchbleeding will stop on its own.
One of the most common and potentially serious
complications of diverticulosis is inflammation and infec-tion of a particular diverticulum, called diverticulitis.
Diverticulitis is three times more likely to occur in
the left side of the large intestine. Since most diverticulaare located in the sigmoid colon (the final segment of thelarge intestine which empties into the rectum), mostdiverticulitis also takes place in the sigmoid. The elderlyhave the most serious complications from diverticulitis,although very severe infections can also occur in patients"

"under the age of 50. Men are three times as likely as
women to be stricken with diverticulitis.
Diverticulitis is believed to occur when a hardened
piece of stool, undigested food, and bacteria (called afecalith) becomes lodged in a diverticulum. This block-age interferes with the blood supply to the area, andinfection sets in.
An individual with diverticulitis will experience pain
(especially in the lower left side of the abdomen) and fever ."
"(especially in the lower left side of the abdomen) and fever .
In response to the infection and the irritation of nearby tis-sues within the abdomen, the abdominal muscles maybegin to spasm. About 25% of all patients with diverticuli-tis will have some rectal bleeding, although this rarelybecomes severe. Walled-off pockets of infection, calledabscesses, may appear within the wall of the intestine, oreven on the exterior surface of the intestine. When a diver-ticulum weakens sufficiently, and is filled to bulging withinfected pus, a perforation in the intestinal wall may devel-op. When the infected contents of the intestine spill out intothe abdomen, the severe infection called peritonitis may"
"occur. Peritonitis is an infection and inflammation of thelining of the abdominal cavity, the peritoneum. Other com-plications of diverticulitis include the formation of abnor-mal connections between two organs that normally do notconnect (fistulas; for example, the intestine and the blad-der), and scarring outside of the intestine which squeezesoff a portion of the intestine, obstructing it.
Diagnosis
As mentioned, the majority of diverticula do not
cause any symptoms, and are often found by coincidenceduring an examination being performed for some othermedical condition.
When diverticula are suspected because a patient
begins to have sudden rectal bleeding, the location of thebleeding can be studied by performing an angiography ."
"Angiography involves inserting a tiny tube through anartery in the leg, and moving it up into one of the majorarteries of the gastrointestinal system. A particular chem-ical (contrast medium) which will show up on x-rayfilms is injected, and the area of bleeding is located bylooking for an area where the contrast is leaking into theinterior (lumen) of the intestine.
A procedure called endoscopy provides another
method for examining the colon and locating the site ofbleeding. In endoscopy, a small, flexible scope (endo-scope) is inserted through the rectum and into the intes-tine. The scope usually bears a fiber-optic camera, whichallows the view through this endoscope to be projectedonto a television screen. The operator can introduce theendoscope further and further through the intestine tofind the location of the bleeding.Diagnosis of diverticulitis is not difficult in"
"patients with previously diagnosed diverticulosis. Thepresence of abdominal pain and fever in such an indi-vidual would make the suspicion of diverticulitis quitehigh. Examination of the abdomen will usually revealtenderness to touch, with the patient’s abdominal mus-cles contracting strongly to protect the tender area.During a rectal exam (performed by inserting a fingerinto the rectum), a doctor may be able to feel anabnormal mass. Touching this mass may prove painfulto the patient.
When a practitioner is suspicious of diverticulitis as
the cause for the patient’s symptoms, he or she will mostlikely avoid the types of tests usually used to diagnosegastrointestinal disorders. These include barium enema"
"and endoscopy. The concern is that the increased pres-sure exerted on the intestine during these exams mayincrease the likelihood of intestinal perforation. Aftermedical treatment for the diverticulitis, these examina-tions may be performed in order to learn the extent of thepatient’s disease.
Treatment
Only about 20% of patients with diverticulosis ever
have symptoms which lead them to seek medical help.Most people never know that they have diverticula. Forthose individuals who have cramping pain and constipa-tion believed to be due to diverticulosis, the usual pre-scription involves increasing the fiber in the diet. Thiscan be done by adding special diet supplements of branor psyllium seed, which increase stool volume. Bleedingdiverticula can usually be treated by bed rest, with bloodtransfusion needed for more severe bleeding (hemor-
rhaging). In cases of very heavy hemorrhaging, medica-tions which encourage clotting can be injected during thecourse of a diagnostic angiography."
"While there are almost no situations when uncom-
plicated diverticulosis requires surgery, giant diverticulaalways require removal. This is due to the very highchance of infection and perforation of these diverticula.When giant diverticula are diagnosed, the usual treat-ment involves removing that portion of the intestine.
Treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis usually
requires hospitalization. “Resting the bowel” is a main-stay of treatment, and involves keeping the patient fromeating or sometimes even drinking anything by mouth.Therefore, the patient will need to receive fluids througha needle in the vein (intravenous or IV fluids). Antibi-
otics will also be administered through the IV . Some
physicians will agree to try treatment at home for verymildly ill patients. These patients will be put on a liquiddiet and receive oral antibiotics.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1092Diverticulosis and diverticulitis"
"The various complications of diverticulitis need to
be treated aggressively, because the death rate from such
things as perforation and peritonitis is quite high.Abscesses can be drained of their infected contents byinserting a needle through the skin of the abdomen andinto the abscess . When this is unsuccessful, open abdom-
inal surgery will be required to remove the piece of theintestine containing the abscess. Fistulas require surgicalrepair, including the removal of the length of intestinecontaining the origin of the fistula, followed by immedi-ate reconnection of the two free ends of intestine. Peri-tonitis requires open surgery. The entire abdominal cavi-ty is cleaned by being irrigated (washed) with a warmedsterile saltwater solution, and the damaged piece ofintestine is removed. Obstructions require immediatesurgery to prevent perforation. Massive, uncontrollablebleeding, while rare, may require removal of part or allof the large intestine."
"During any of these types of operations, the surgeon
must make an important decision regarding the quantityof intestine which must be removed. When the amount ofintestine removed is great, it may be necessary to per-form a colostomy . A colostomy involves pulling the end
of the remaining intestine through the abdominal wall, tothe outside. This bit of intestine is then fashioned so thata bag can be fit over it. The patient’s waste (feces) collectin the bag, because the intestine no longer connects withthe rectum. This colostomy may be temporary, in whichcase another operation will be required to reconnect theintestine, after some months of substantial healing hasoccurred. Other times, the colostomy will need to be per-manent, and the patient will have to adjust to living per-manently with the colostomy bag. Most people withcolostomies are able to go on with a very active life.

Dizziness
Definition
As a disorder, dizziness is classified into three cate-
gories—vertigo, syncope, and nonsyncope nonvertigo.Each category has a characteristic set of symptoms, allrelated to the sense of balance. In general, syncope isdefined by a brief loss of consciousness ( fainting ) or by"
"dimmed vision and feeling uncoordinated, confused, andlightheaded. Many people experience a sensation likesyncope when they stand up too fast. Vertigo is the feelingthat either the individual or the surroundings are spinning.This sensation is like being on a spinning amusementpark ride. Individuals with nonsyncope nonvertigo dizzi-ness feel as though they cannot keep their balance. Thisfeeling may become worse with movement.Description
The brain coordinates information from the eyes, the
inner ear, and the body’s senses to maintain balance. Ifany of these information sources is disrupted, the brainmay not be able to compensate. For example, peoplesometimes experience motion sickness because the
information from their body tells the brain that they aresitting still, but information from the eyes indicates thatthey are moving. The messages don’t correspond anddizziness results.
Vision and the body’s senses are the most important"
"Vision and the body’s senses are the most important
systems for maintaining balance, but problems in theinner ear are the most frequent cause of dizziness. Theinner ear, also called the vestibular system, contains fluidthat helps fine tune the information the brain receivesfrom the eyes and the body. When fluid volume or pres-sure in one inner ear changes, information about balanceis altered. The discrepancy gives conflicting messages tothe brain about balance and induces dizziness.
Certain medical conditions can cause dizziness,
because they affect the systems that maintain balance.For example, the inner ear is very sensitive to changes inblood flow. Because medical conditions such as highblood pressure or low blood sugar can affect blood flow,these conditions are frequently accompanied by dizzi-ness. Circulation disorders are the most common causesof dizziness. Other causes are head injury , ear infection,
allergies , and nervous system disorders."

Dizziness often disappears without treatment or with
treatment of the underlying problem, but it can be longterm or chronic. According to the National Institutes ofHealth, 42% of Americans will seek medical help fordizziness at some point in their lives. The costs mayexceed a billion dollars and account for five million doc-tor visits annually. Episodes of dizziness increase withage. Among people aged 75 or older, dizziness is themost frequent reason for seeing a doctor.

Careful attention to symptoms can help determine

Not all casesof dizziness can be linked to a specific cause. More thanone type of dizziness can be experienced at the sametime and symptoms may be mixed. Episodes of dizzinessmay last for a few seconds or for days. The length of anepisode is related to the underlying cause.

of blood to the brain; they often occur when a person isstanding up and can be relieved by sitting or lying down.Vertigo is characterized by a sensation of spinning or turn-ing, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears,headache , or fatigue . An individual may have trouble
walking, remaining coordinated, or keeping balance. Non-syncope nonvertigo dizziness is characterized by a feelingof being off balance that becomes worse if the individualtries moving or performing detail-intense tasks.
A person may experience dizziness for many rea-
sons. Syncope is associated with low blood pressure,heart problems, and disorders in the autonomic nervoussystem, the system of involuntary functions such asbreathing. Syncope may also arise from emotional dis-tress, pain , and other reactions to outside stressors. Non-

"well as by more serious medical conditions.
Vertigo is often associated with inner ear problems
called vestibular disorders. A particularly intense vestibulardisorder, Méniére’s disease, interferes with the volume offluid in the inner ear. This disease, which affects approxi-mately one in every 1,000 people, causes intermittent verti-go over the course of weeks, months, or years. Méniére’sdisease is often accompanied by ringing or buzzing in theear,hearing loss , and a feeling that the ear is blocked.
Damage to the nerve that leads from the ear to the brain canalso cause vertigo. Such damage can result from headinjury or a tumor. An acoustic neuroma , for example, is a
benign tumor that wraps around the nerve. Vertigo can alsobe caused by disorders of the central nervous system andthe circulatory system, such as hardening of the arteries(arteriosclerosis), stroke , or multiple sclerosis .

"Some medications cause changes in blood pressure
or blood flow. These medications can cause dizziness insome people. Prescription medications carry warningsof such side effects, but common drugs, such as caf-
feine or nicotine can also cause dizziness. Certain
antibiotics can damage the inner ear and cause hearing
loss and dizziness.
Diet may cause dizziness. The role of diet may be
direct, as through alcohol intake. It may be also be indi-rect, as through arteriosclerosis caused by a high-fat diet.Some people experience a slight dip in blood sugar andmild dizziness if they miss a meal, but this condition israrely dangerous unless the person is diabetic. Food sen-sitivities or allergies can also be a cause of dizziness.Chronic conditions, such as heart disease, and seriousacute problems, such as seizures and strokes, can causedizziness. However, such conditions usually exhibit othercharacteristic symptoms.Diagnosis

"During the initial medical examination, an individ-
ual with dizziness should provide a detailed descriptionof the type of dizziness experienced, when it occurs, andhow often each episode lasts. A diary of symptoms mayhelp track this information. Report any symptoms thataccompany the dizziness, such as a ringing in the ear ornausea, any recent injury or infection, and any medica-tion taken.
Blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and body temper-
ature are checked, and the ear, nose, and throat are scruti-nized. The sense of balance is assessed by moving theindividual’s head to various positions or by tilt-table test-ing. In tilt-table testing, the person lies on a table that canbe shifted into different positions and reports any dizzi-ness that occurs.

nation. Hearing tests help assess ear damage. x rays,computed tomography scan (CT scan), and magnetic

"resonance imaging (MRI) can pinpoint evidence of
nerve damage, tumor, or other structural problems. If avestibular disorder is suspected, a technique calledelectronystagmography (ENG) may be used. ENG mea-sures the electrical impulses generated by eye move-ments. Blood tests can determine diabetes, high choles-
terol , and other diseases. In some cases, a heart evalua-
tion may be useful. Despite thorough testing, an underly-ing cause cannot always be determined.
Treatment
Treatment is determined by the underlying cause. If
an individual has a cold or influenza , a few days of bed
rest is usually adequate to resolve dizziness. Other caus-es of dizziness, such as mild vestibular system damage,may resolve without medical treatment.

"If dizziness continues, drug therapy may prove
helpful. Because circulatory problems often cause dizzi-ness, medication may be prescribed to control bloodpressure or to treat arteriosclerosis. Sedatives may beuseful to relieve the tension that can trigger or aggravatedizziness. Low blood sugar associated with diabetessometimes causes dizziness and is treated by controllingblood sugar levels. An individual may be asked to avoidcaffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and any substances thatcause allergic reactions. A low-salt diet may also helpsome people.
When other measures have failed, surgery may be
suggested to relieve pressure on the inner ear. If thedizziness is not treatable by drugs, surgery, or othermeans, physical therapy may be used and the patient maybe taught coping mechanisms for the problem.

"Alternative treatment
Because dizziness may arise from serious conditions,
it is advisable to seek medical treatment. Alternative treat-ments can often be used alongside conventional medicinewithout conflict. Relaxation techniques, such as yoga and
massage therapy that focus on relieving tension, are pop-
ularly recommended methods for reducing stress . Aro-
matherapists recommend a warm bath scented with essen-tial oils of lavender, geranium, and sandalwood.
Homeopathic therapies can work very effectively
for dizziness, and are especially applicable when noorganic cause can be identified. An osteopath or chiro-practor may suggest adjustments of the head, jaw, neck,and lower back to relieve pressure on the inner ear.Acupuncturists also offer some treatment options foracute and chronic cases of dizziness. Nutritionists maybe able to offer advice and guidance in choosing dietarysupplements, identifying foods to avoid, and balancingnutritional needs.KEY TERMS"

Outcome depends on the cause of dizziness. Control-

Prevention
Most people learn through experience that certain
activities will make them dizzy and they learn to avoidthem. For example, if reading in a car produces motionsickness, an individual leaves reading materials for afterthe trip. Changes to the diet can also cut down onepisodes of dizziness in susceptible people. Relaxationtechniques can help ward off tension and anxiety that

"can cause dizziness.
These techniques can help minimize or even prevent
dizziness for people with chronic diseases. For example,persons with Méniére’s disease may avoid episodes ofvertigo by leaving salt, alcohol, and caffeine out of theirdiets . Reducing blood cholesterol can help diminish arte-
riosclerosis and indirectly treat dizziness.
Some cases of dizziness cannot be prevented.
Acoustic neuromas, for example, are not predictable orpreventable. When the underlying cause of dizziness can-not be discovered, it may be difficult to recommend pre-ventive measures. Alternative approaches designed torebalance the body’s energy flow, such as acupuncture
and constitutional homeopathy , may be helpful in cases
where the cause of dizziness cannot be pinpointed.

Doppler ultrasonography
Definition
Doppler ultrasonography is a non-invasive diagnos-
tic procedure that changes sound waves into an imagethat can be viewed on a monitor.
Purpose
Doppler ultrasonography can detect the direction,
velocity, and turbulence of blood flow. It is frequentlyused to detect problems with heart valves or to measureblood flow through the arteries. Specifically, it is usefulin the work up of stroke patients, in assessing blood flow
in the abdomen or legs, and in viewing the heart to moni-tor carotid artery diseases.
Precautions
The test is widely used because it is noninvasive,
uses no x rays, and gives excellent images. It is harmless,painless, and widely available.

"Description
Doppler ultrasonography makes use of two different
principles. The ultrasound principle is this: when a high-frequency sound is produced and aimed at a target, it willbe reflected by its target and the reflected sound can bedetected back at its origin. In addition, it is known thatcertain crystals (called piezoelectric crystals) produce anelectrical pulse when vibrated by a returning sound.
The Doppler principle is simply that sound pitch
increases as the source moves toward the listener anddecreases as it moves away.

"Medical science utilizes these two principles in the
following way. A transducer (sometimes called a probe)containing piezoelectric crystals sends a series of shortsound pulses into the body and pauses between eachpulse to listen for the returning sounds. The machinethen determines the direction and depth of each returningsound and coverts this into a point of light on a televisionmonitor. Thousands of these pulses are computed anddisplayed every second to produce an image of the organbeing studied. The image allows the doctor to see theorgan functioning in real time.
The newest addition to this test is the addition of
color. Adding color to the image shows the direction andrate of blood flow more clearly.

"During a Doppler ultrasonography procedure the
technician will apply a gel to the skin, then place thetransducer against the skin at various angles. The trans-ducer sends the information it receives to a televisionmonitor that shows a moving image of the organ beingstudied. The technician can save these images either onvideo tape, paper, or x-ray film for further study.
Preparation
There is no special preparation needed for this test.
The ultrasound technician may apply a clear gel to the skinin order to help the transducer more freely over the body.
Aftercare
No aftercare is necessary.
Normal results
A Doppler ultrasonography test showing no restrict-
ed blood flow, is a normal finding.

Down syndrome
Definition
Down syndrome is the most common cause of men-
tal retardation and malformation in a newborn. It
occurs because of the presence of an extra chromosome.
Description
Chromosomes are the units of genetic information"
"Description
Chromosomes are the units of genetic information
that exist within every cell of the body. Twenty-three dis-tinctive pairs, or 46 total chromosomes, are located with-in the nucleus (central structure) of each cell. When ababy is conceived by the combining of one sperm cellwith one egg cell, the baby receives 23 chromosomesfrom each parent, for a total of 46 chromosomes. Some-times, an accident in the production of a sperm or eggcell causes that cell to contain 24 chromosomes. ThisKEY TERMS

"ear to hear.event is referred to as nondisjunction. When this defec-
tive cell is involved in the conception of a baby, that babywill have a total of 47 chromosomes. The extra chromo-some in Down syndrome is labeled number 21. For thisreason, the existence of three such chromosomes issometimes referred to as Trisomy 21.
In a very rare number of Down syndrome cases
(about 1–2%), the original egg and sperm cells are com-pletely normal. The problem occurs sometime shortlyafter fertilization; during the phase where cells are divid-ing rapidly. One cell divides abnormally, creating a lineof cells with an extra chromosome 21. This form ofgenetic disorder is called a mosaic. The individual withthis type of Down syndrome has two types of cells: thosewith 46 chromosomes (the normal number), and thosewith 47 chromosomes (as occurs in Down syndrome).Some researchers have suggested that individuals withthis type of mosaic form of Down syndrome have lesssevere signs and symptoms of the disorder."
"Another relatively rare genetic accident which can
cause Down syndrome is called translocation. During celldivision, the number 21 chromosome somehow breaks. Apiece of the 21 chromosome then becomes attached toanother chromosome. Each cell still has 46 chromosomes,but the extra piece of chromosome 21 results in the signsand symptoms of Down syndrome. Translocations occurin about 3–4% of cases of Down syndrome.
Down syndrome occurs in about one in every"
"Down syndrome occurs in about one in every
800–1,000 births. It affects an equal number of boys andgirls. Less than 25% of Down syndrome cases occur dueto an extra chromosome in the sperm cell. The majorityof cases of Down syndrome occur due to an extra chro-mosome 21 within the egg cell supplied by the mother(nondisjunction). As a woman’s age (maternal age)increases, the risk of having a Down syndrome babyincreases significantly. For example, at younger ages, therisk is about one in 4,000. By the time the woman is age35, the risk increases to one in 400; by age 40 the riskincreases to one in 110; and by age 45 the risk becomesone in 35. There is no increased risk of either mosaicismor translocation with increased maternal age.
Causes and symptoms

"Causes and symptoms
While Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder, a
baby is usually identified at birth through observation ofa set of common physical characteristics. Babies withDown syndrome tend to be overly quiet, less responsive,with weak, floppy muscles. Furthermore, a number ofphysical signs may be present. These include:
• flat appearing face
• small head
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1098Down syndrome"
"• flat bridge of the nose
• smaller than normal, low-set nose• small mouth, which causes the tongue to stick out and
to appear overly large
• upward slanting eyes
• extra folds of skin located at the inside corner of each
eye, near the nose (called epicanthal folds)
• rounded cheeks• small, misshapen ears
• small, wide hands
• an unusual, deep crease across the center of the palm
(called a simian crease)
• a malformed fifth finger• a wide space between the big and the second toes
• unusual creases on the soles of the feet
• overly-flexible joints (sometimes referred to as being
double-jointed)
• ahorter than normal height
Other types of defects often accompany Down syn-
drome. About 30–50% of all children with Down syn-drome are found to have heart defects. A number of dif-ferent heart defects are common in Down syndrome,including abnormal openings (holes) in the walls thatseparate the heart’s chambers ( atrial septal defect ,ven-"
"tricular septal defect ). These result in abnormal patterns
of blood flow within the heart. The abnormal blood flowoften means that less oxygen is sent into circulationthroughout the body. Another heart defect that occurs inDown syndrome is called Tetralogy of Fallot . Tetralogy
of Fallot consists of a hole in the heart, along with threeother major heart defects.
Malformations of the gastrointestinal tract are pre-
sent in about 5–7% of children with Down syndrome.The most common malformation is a narrowed, obstruct-ed duodenum (the part of the intestine into which thestomach empties). This disorder, called duodenal atresia,interferes with the baby’s milk or formula leaving thestomach and entering the intestine for digestion. Thebaby often vomits forcibly after feeding, and cannot gainweight appropriately until the defect is repaired.
Other medical conditions that occur in patients with"
"Other medical conditions that occur in patients with
Down syndrome include an increased chance of develop-ing infections, especially ear infections and pneumonia ;
certain kidney disorders; thyroid disease (especially lowor hypothyroid); hearing loss ; vision impairment requir-
ing glasses (corrective lenses); and a 20-times greaterchance of developing leukemia (a blood disorder).

drome occurs at a much slower than normal rate.Because of weak, floppy muscles (hypotonia), babies"
"drome occurs at a much slower than normal rate.Because of weak, floppy muscles (hypotonia), babies
learn to sit up, crawl, and walk much later than their nor-mal peers. Talking is also quite delayed. The level ofmental retardation is considered to be mild-to-moderatein Down syndrome. The actual IQ range of Down syn-drome children is quite varied, but the majority of suchchildren are in what is sometimes known as the trainablerange. This means that most people with Down syn-drome can be trained to do regular self-care tasks, func-tion in a socially appropriate manner in a normal homeenvironment, and even hold simple jobs.
As people with Down syndrome age, they face an
increased chance of developing the brain disease calledAlzheimer’s (sometimes referred to as dementia or
senility). Most people have a six in 100 risk of develop-ing Alzheimer’s, but people with Down syndrome have a25 in 100 chance of the disease. Alzheimer’s disease"
"causes the brain to shrink and to break down. The num-ber of brain cells decreases, and abnormal deposits andstructural arrangements occur. This process results in aloss of brain functioning. People with Alzheimer’s havestrikingly faulty memories. Over time, people withAlzheimer’s disease will lapse into an increasingly unre-sponsive state. Some researchers have shown that evenDown syndrome patients who do not appear to haveAlzheimer’s disease have the same changes occurring tothe structures and cells of their brains.
As people with Down syndrome age, they also have
an increased chance of developing a number of other ill-nesses, including cataracts , thyroid problems, diabetes,
and seizure disorders.

verify the presence of the disorder. This testing is usuallydone on a blood sample, although chromosome analysiscan also be done on other types of tissue, including skin.The cells to be studied are prepared in a laboratory.Chemical stain is added to make the characteristics of thecells and the chromosomes stand out. Chemicals areadded to prompt the cells to go through normal develop-ment, up to the point where the chromosomes are mostvisible, prior to cell division. At this point, they areexamined under a microscope and photographed. Thephotograph is used to sort the different sizes and shapesof chromosomes into pairs. In most cases of Down syn-drome, one extra chromosome 21 will be revealed. Thefinal result of such testing, with the photographed chro-mosomes paired and organized by shape and size, iscalled the individual’s karyotype.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1099Down syndrome"
"Treatment
No treatment is available to cure Down syndrome.
Treatment is directed at addressing the individual con-cerns of a particular patient. For example, heart defectswill many times require surgical repair, as will duodenalatresia. Many Down syndrome patients will need to wearglasses to correct vision. Patients with hearing impair-ment benefit from hearing aids .
A new drug, referred to as a “smart drug,” has been
receiving some attention in the treatment of Down syn-drome patients. This drug, piracetam, has not beenproven to increase intellectual ability, despite testimoni-als that have been receiving attention on television andthe Internet. Piracetam has not been approved for use inthe United States, although it is being sold via the Inter-net. The National Down Syndrome Society and theNational Down Syndrome Congress do not recommendthe use of this drug as of 2001.

"While some decades ago, all Down syndrome chil-
dren were quickly placed into institutions for lifelongcare. Research shows very clearly that the best outlookfor children with Down syndrome is a normal family lifein their own home. This requires careful support and edu-cation of the parents and the siblings. It is a life-changingevent to learn that a new baby has a permanent conditionthat will effect essentially all aspects of his or her devel-opment. Some community groups exist to help familiesdeal with the emotional effects of this new information,and to help plan for the baby’s future. Schools arerequired to provide services for children with Down syn-drome, sometimes in separate special education class-rooms, and sometimes in regular classrooms (this iscalled mainstreaming or inclusion).
Prognosis
The prognosis in Down syndrome is quite variable,"
"Prognosis
The prognosis in Down syndrome is quite variable,
depending on the types of complications (heart defects,susceptibility to infections, development of leukemia) ofeach individual baby. The severity of the retardation canalso vary significantly. Without the presence of heartdefects, about 90% of children with Down syndrome liveinto their teens. People with Down syndrome appear togo through the normal physical changes of aging more
rapidly, however. The average age of death for an indi-
vidual with Down syndrome is about 50–55 years.
Still, the prognosis for a baby born with Down syn-
drome is better than ever before. Because of modernmedical treatments, including antibiotics to treat infec-
tions and surgery to treat heart defects and duodenal atre-sia, life expectancy has greatly increased. Communityand family support allows people with Down syndrometo have rich, meaningful relationships. Because of educa-
tional programs, some people with Down syndrome areable to hold jobs."
"tional programs, some people with Down syndrome areable to hold jobs.
Men with Down syndrome appear to be uniformly
sterile (meaning that they are unable to have offspring).Women with Down syndrome, however, are fully capa-ble of having babies. About 50% of these babies, howev-er, will also be born with Down syndrome.
Prevention
Efforts at prevention of Down syndrome are aimed
at genetic counseling of couples who are preparing to
have babies. A counselor needs to inform a woman thather risk of having a baby with Down syndrome increaseswith her increasing age. Two types of testing is availableduring a pregnancy to determine if the baby being car-
ried has Down syndrome.
Screening tests are used to estimate the chance that"
"ried has Down syndrome.
Screening tests are used to estimate the chance that
an individual woman will have a baby with Down syn-drome. At 14–17 weeks of pregnancy, measurements of asubstance called AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) can be per-formed. AFP is normally found circulating in the bloodof a pregnant woman, but may be unusually high or lowwith certain disorders. Carrying a baby with Down syn-drome often causes AFP to be lower than normal. Thisinformation alone, or along with measurements of twoother hormones, is considered along with the mother’sage to calculate the risk of the baby being born withDown syndrome. These results are only predictions, andare only correct about 60% of the time.
The only way to definitively establish (with about
98–99% accuracy) the presence or absence of Down syn-drome in a developing baby, is to test tissue from thepregnancy itself. This is usually done either by amnio-
centesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). In amnio-"
"centesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). In amnio-
centesis, a small amount of the fluid in which the baby isfloating is withdrawn with a long, thin needle. In chori-onic villus sampling, a tiny tube is inserted into the open-ing of the uterus to retrieve a small sample of the placen-ta (the organ that attaches the growing baby to the moth-er via the umbilical cord, and provides oxygen andnutrition ). Both amniocentesis and CVS allow the
baby’s own karyotype to be determined. A couple mustthen decide whether to use this information in order tobegin to prepare for the arrival of a baby with Down syn-drome, or to terminate the pregnancy.
Once a couple has had one baby with Down syn-
drome, they are often concerned about the likelihood offuture offspring also being born with the disorder. Mostresearch indicates that this chance remains the same asfor any woman at a similar age. However, when the baby
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1100Down syndrome"
"with Down syndrome has the type that results from a
translocation, it is possible that one of the two parents isa carrier of that defect. A carrier “carries” the geneticdefect, but does not actually have the disorder. Whenone parent is a carrier of a translocation, the chance offuture offspring having Down syndrome is greatlyincreased. The specific risk will have to be calculated bya genetic counselor.

Drug metabolism/interactions
Definition
Drug metabolism is the process by which the body
breaks down and converts medication into active chemi-cal substances.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1101Drug metabolism/interactions"
"Precautions
Drugs can interact with other drugs, foods, and bev-
erages. Interactions can lessen or magnify the desiredtherapeutic effect of a drug, or may cause unwanted orunexpected side effects. There are thousands of possibledrug-to-drug and drug-to-food interactions, and manymedications and supplements are contraindicated (notrecommended) under certain conditions or in patientswith specific diseases and disorders. This is why it isimperative that patients always keep their physician fullyinformed about all drugs and dietary supplements(including herbal remedies) they are taking.
Description
The primary site of drug metabolism is the liver, the
organ that plays a major role in metabolism, digestion,detoxification, and elimination of substances from the"
"body. Enzymes in the liver are responsible for chemicallychanging drug components into substances known asmetabolites. Metabolites are then bound to other sub-stances for excretion through the lungs, or bodily fluidssuch as saliva, sweat, breast milk, and urine, or throughreabsorption by the intestines. The primary mode ofexcretion is through the kidneys.
The family of liver isoenzymes known as cytochrome
P-450 are crucial to drug metabolism. These enzymes(labeled CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, andCYP3A4) have a catabolic action on substances, breakingthem down into metabolites. Consequently, they also act tolower the concentration of medication in the bloodstream.
Drug interactions can occur when one drug inhibits
or induces a P-450 that acts on another drug. An exam-ple is nicotine, a drug contained in tobacco, and knownto induce P-450s. Individuals with liver disease (e.g.,cirrhosis ) may also have insufficient levels of P-450"
"enzymes. As a result, the concentration of drugs metab-olized by these enzymes (e.g., amprenavir and otherprotease inhibitors ) remains high and can build up to
toxic levels in the bloodstream. In addition, certainmedications and foods, such as grapefruit juice, caninactivate or lessen the metabolic activity of P-450s.Changing the drug dosage can alleviate the problem insome cases.
The metabolic rate can vary significantly from per-
son to person, and drug dosages that work quickly andeffectively in one individual may not work well foranother. Factors such as genetics, environment, nutri-
tion and age also influence drug metabolism; infants
and elderly patients may have a reduced capacity tometabolize certain drugs, and may require adjustmentsin dosage.Causes and symptoms

Drug overdose
Definition
A drug overdose is the accidental or intentional use
of a drug or medicine in an amount that is higher than isnormally used.
Description
All drugs have the potential to be misused, whether
legally prescribed by a doctor, purchased over-the-counter at the local drug store, or bought illegally on thestreet. Taken in combination with other drugs or withalcohol, even drugs normally considered safe can causedeath or serious long term consequences. Children are"
"particularly at risk for accidental overdose, accountingfor over one million poisonings each year from drugs,alcohol, and other chemicals and toxic substances. Peo-ple who suffer from depression and who have suicidalthoughts are also at high risk for drug overdose.
Causes and symptoms
Accidental drug overdose may be the result of mis-
use of prescription medicines or commonly used medica-tions like pain relievers and cold remedies. Symptoms
differ depending on the drug taken. Some of the drugscommonly involved in overdoses are listed below alongwith symptoms and outcomes.
Acetaminophen is the generic name for the com-
monly used pain reliever Tylenol. Overdose of this drugcauses liver damage with symptoms that include loss ofappetite, tiredness, nausea and vomiting , paleness, and"
"sweating. The next stage of symptoms indicates liverfailure and includes abdominal pain and tenderness,swelling of the liver, and abnormal blood tests for liverenzymes. In the last stage of this poisoning , liver failure
advances and the patient becomes jaundiced, with yel-lowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. They may alsoexperience kidney failure, bleeding disorders, andencephalopathy (swelling of the brain).
Anticholinergic drugs (drugs that block the action of
acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter) like atropine, scopo-lamine, belladonna, antihistamines , and antipsychotic
agents cause the skin and moist tissues (like in the mouthand nose) to become dry and flushed. Dilated pupils, aninability to urinate, and mental disturbances are alsosymptoms. Severe toxicity can lead to seizures, abnormalheart rhythms, extremely high blood pressure, and coma .
Antidepressant drugs like amitriptyline, desi-"
"Antidepressant drugs like amitriptyline, desi-
pramine, and nortriptyline can cause irregular heart rate,vomiting, low blood pressure, confusion, and seizures. Anoverdose of antidepressants also causes symptoms similarto those seen with anticholinergic drug overdoses.
Cholinergic drugs (drugs that stimulate the
parasympathetic nervous system) like carbamate andpilocarpine cause nausea, diarrhea , increased secretion
of body fluids (sweat, tears, saliva, and urine), fatigue ,
and muscle weakness. Convulsions are possible. Deathcan occur due to respiratory failure and heart failure .
Cocaine and crack cocaine overdoses cause seizures,
high blood pressure, increased heart rate, paranoia , and
other changes in behavior. Heart attack or stroke are
serious risks within three days after cocaine overdose.
Depressant drugs (tranquilizers, antianxiety drugs ,"
"Depressant drugs (tranquilizers, antianxiety drugs ,
sleeping pills) cause sleepiness, slowed or slurred speech,difficulty walking or standing, blurred vision, impairedability to think, disorientation, and mood changes. Over-

"dose symptoms can include slowed breathing, very low
blood pressure, stupor, coma, shock , and death.
Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause
irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite,and blurred vision.
Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine,
and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) arealso in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causessedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart
rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where theblack centers of the eyes become smaller than normal,are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugsare taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun-teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that thepatient will stop breathing.
Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or
ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay),and creams for psoriasis , a skin condition. Initial symp-
toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever , and vomiting,"
"toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever , and vomiting,
possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose willcause metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis , con-
ditions where the body’s acid/base balance is malfunc-tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fastbreathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion,hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An
increased tendency to bleed is also common. Seriouscomplications include acute renal failure, coma, and heartfailure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death.

"Diagnosis
Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the
symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten-sive damage to the body before significant symptomsdevelop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be ableto tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. Thepatient’s recent medical and social history may also helpin a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that thepatient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumedrecently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hoursbefore the overdose, can be valuable in determining whatwas taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system.

"Different drugs have varying effects on the body’s
acid/base balance and on certain elements in the bloodlike potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used todetect changes in body chemistry that may give clues towhat drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened forvarious drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug isidentified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fastthe drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests canalso be used to screen for some drugs and to detectchanges in the body’s chemistry. Blood and urine testsmay show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a
result of the overdose.

Treatment
Immediate care
If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and
the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is notbreathing, call for emergency help immediately. If theperson who took the drug is not having symptoms, don’twait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison controlcenter immediately. Providing as much information aspossible to the poison control center can help determinewhat the next course of action should be.
The poison control center, paramedics, and emer-
gency room staff will want to know:
• what drug(s) were taken—try to locate the drug’s con-
tainer.
• how much of the drug was taken
• when was the drug taken
• was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or
chemicals
• what is the age of the patient
• what symptoms are the patient experiencing
• is the patient conscious
• is the patient breathing
The poison control center may recommend trying to

Emergency care
Emergency medical treatment may include:
• Assessment of the patient’s airway and breathing to
making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, isnot blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted throughthe mouth and into the trachea to help the patientbreath. This procedure is called intubation.
• Assessment of the patient’s heart rate, blood pressure,
body temperature, and other physical signs that mightindicate the effects of the drug.
• Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for

Drug therapy monitoring
Definition
Drug therapy monitoring, also known as Therapeutic
Drug Monitoring (TDM), is a means of monitoring druglevels in the blood.
Purpose
TDM is employed to measure blood drug levels so
that the most effective dosage can be determined, withtoxicity prevented. TDM is also utilized to identify non-compliant patients (those patients who, for whatever rea-son, either cannot or will not comply with drug dosagesas prescribed by the physician).
Precautions
Because so many different factors influence blood"
"Precautions
Because so many different factors influence blood
drug levels, the following points should be taken intoconsideration during TDM: the age and weight of thepatient; the route of administration of the drug; the drug’sabsorption rate, excretion rate, delivery rate, and dosage;other medications the patient is taking; other diseases thepatient has; the patient’s compliance regarding the drugtreatment regimen; and the laboratory methods used totest for the drug.
Description
TDM is a practical tool that can help the physician
provide effective and safe drug therapy in patients whoneed medication. Monitoring can be used to confirm ablood drug concentration level that is above or below thetherapeutic range, or if the desired therapeutic effect ofthe drug is not as expected. If this is the case, anddosages beyond normal then have to be prescribed, TDMcan minimize the time that elapses.TDM is important for patients who have other dis-"
"eases that can affect drug levels, or who take other medi-cines that may affect drug levels by interacting with thedrug being tested. As an example, without drug monitor-ing, the physician cannot be sure if a patient’s lack ofresponse to an antibiotic reflects bacterial resistance, oris the result of failure to reach the proper therapeuticrange of antibiotic concentration in the blood. In cases oflife-threatening infections, timing of effective antibiotictherapy is critical to success. It is equally crucial to avoidtoxicity in a seriously ill patient. Therefore, if toxicsymptoms appear with standard dosages, TDM can beused to determine changes in dosing.
Drawn blood, used for TDM, demonstrates a drug"
"Drawn blood, used for TDM, demonstrates a drug
action in the body at any specific time, whereas drug lev-els examined from urine samples reflect the presence of adrug over many days (depending on the rate of excre-tion). Therefore, blood testing is the procedure of choicewhen definite data are required. However, for adequateabsorption and therapeutic levels to be accurate, it isimportant to allow for sufficient time to pass between theadministration of the medication and the collection of theblood sample.
Blood specimens for drug monitoring can be taken
at two different times: during the drug’s highest thera-peutic concentration (“peak” level), or its lowest(“trough” level). Occasionally called residual levels,trough levels show sufficient therapeutic levels; whereaspeak levels show poisoning (toxicity). Peak and trough
levels should fall within the therapeutic range.
Preparation
In preparing for this test, the following guidelines
should be observed:"
"Preparation
In preparing for this test, the following guidelines
should be observed:
• Depending on the drug to be tested, the physician
should decide if the patient is to be fasting (nothing
to eat or drink for a specified period of hours) beforethe test.
• For patients suspected of symptoms of drug toxicity,
the best time to draw the blood specimen is when thesymptoms are occurring.
• If there is a question as to whether an adequate dose of
the drug is being achieved, it is best to obtain trough(lowest therapeutic concentration) levels.
• Peak (highest concentration) levels are usually obtained
one to two hours after oral intake, approximately onehour after intramuscular (IM) administration (a shot inthe muscle), and approximately 30 minutes after intra-venous (IV) administration. Residual, or trough, levelsare usually obtained within 15 minutes of the nextscheduled dose.

Dry mouth
Definition
Dry mouth, known medically as xerostomia, is the
abnormal reduction of saliva due to medication, disease,or medical therapy.KEY TERMS
Cesarean section —The delivery of a baby through
a surgical procedure.
Fetus —A developing baby inside the womb.
Hormone —A substance that is produced in one
part of the body, then travels through the blood-stream to another part of the body where it has itseffect.Description
Dry mouth due to the lack of saliva can be a serious
medical problem. Decreased salivation can make swal-lowing difficult, can decrease taste sensation, and canpromote tooth decay .
Causes and symptoms
Dry mouth, resulting from thickened or reduced"
"Causes and symptoms
Dry mouth, resulting from thickened or reduced
salvia flow, can be caused by a number of factors: med-ications, both prescription and over-the-counter; sys-temic diseases, such as anemia or diabetes, manifesta-tions of Sjögren’s syndrome (as rheumatoid arthritis ,
lupus, chronic hardening and thickening of the skin, orchronic and progressive inflammation of sketal muscles);infections of the salivary glands; blockage of the salivaryducts caused by stones or tumors forming in the ductsthrough which the saliva passes; dehydration ; medical
therapies, such as local surgery or radiation; secretionreduction normally involved in the aging proces; and
emotional stress .
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of dry mouth is not difficult. The
patient will state that his or her saliva is very thick ornon-existent. Finding the cause of the dry mouth may bemore difficult and require some laboratory testing. Sali-vary gland biopsy for stones or tumors should be per-formed if indicated."
"Treatment
The treatment of dry mouth involves the manage-
ment of the condition causing it. If dry mouth is causedby medication, the medication should be changed. If drymouth is caused by blockage of the salivary ducts, thecause of the blockage should be investigated. When sys-temic diseases, such as diabetes and anemia, are broughtunder control dry mouth problems may decrease.
The use of caffeine-containing beverages, alcoholic
beverages, and mouthwashes containing alcohol shouldbe minimized. The drinking of water and fruit juices willdecrease dry mouth problems.

The duodenum is the first part of the intestine, into
which the stomach, the gall bladder, and the pancreasempty their contents. The pylorus connects the duode-num with the stomach and contains the valve that regu-lates stomach emptying. Obstruction usually occurs rightat this outlet, so that the gall bladder and pancreas areunable to drain their secretions without hindrance.

"Causes and symptoms
Obstruction of the duodenum occurs in adults and
infants, each for a different set of reasons. In adults, theusual cause is a peptic ulcer of such antiquity that repeat-ed cycles of injury and scarring have narrowed the pas-sageway. Medical treatment of ulcers has progressed tothe point where such obstinate ulcer disease is rarelyseen any more. In infants, the conditions are congeni-tal—either the channel is underdeveloped or the pylorusis overdeveloped. The first type is called duodenalhypoplasia and the second is termed hypertrophicpyloric stenosis . In rare cases, the channel may be miss-
ing altogether, a condition called duodenal atresia. To saythat these anomalies are congenital is not to say theircause is understood. As with most birth defects , the spe-
cific cause is not known.

"cific cause is not known.
Food that cannot exit the stomach in the forward
direction will return whence it came. V omiting is theconstant symptom of duodenal obstruction. It may bepreceded by indigestion and nausea as the stomach
attempts to squeeze its contents through an ever narrow-ing outlet.
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis appears soon after
birth. The infant will vomit feedings, lose weight, and berestless and irritable.
Diagnosis
X rays taken with contrast material in the stomach
readily demonstrate the site of the blockage and often theulcer that caused it. Gastroscopy is another way to evalu-ate the problem. In infants, x rays may not be necessary todetect pyloric stenosis. It is often possible to feel theenlarged pylorus, like an olive, deep under the ribs and seethe stomach rippling as it labors to force food through.

"Treatment
Bowel obstruction requires a surgeon, sometimes
immediately. Newer surgical techniques constantlyimprove the outcome, but obstruction is a mechanicalproblem that needs a mechanical solution. Most adultswho come to surgery for obstruction have suffered foryears from peptic ulcer disease. They will usually benefitfrom ulcer surgery at the same time their obstruction is
relieved. The surgeon will therefore select a procedurethat combines relief of obstruction with remedy for ulcerdisease. There are many choices. In fact, even withoutobstruction, functional considerations require ulcersurgery to include enhancement of stomach emptying.

"To treat an infant with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis,
some surgeons have had success with forceful balloondilation of the pylorus done through a gastroscope, butthe standard procedure is to cut across the overdevelopedcircular muscle that is constricting the stomach outlet.There are reports of infant hypertrophic pyloric stenosisremitting without surgery following a very careful feed-ing schedule, but mortality is unacceptably high.
Prognosis
A functioning and unrestricted intestine is a prereq-
uisite for living independent of the most advanced andcontinuous medical care available. Achieving this desir-able goal is the rule with surgery for duodenal obstruc-tions of all types. The bowel is so malleable that there isa rearrangement to suit every occasion. The variety ofpossible configurations is limited only by the surgeon’simagination.

Definition
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is irregular, abnor-
mal uterine bleeding that is not caused by a tumor, infec-tion, or pregnancy .
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1111Dysfunctional uterine bleeding"
"Description
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is a disorder
that occurs most frequently in women at the beginningand end of their reproductive lives. About half the casesoccur in women over 45 years of age, and about one fifthoccur in women under age 20.
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is diagnosed when
other causes of uterine bleeding have been eliminated.Failure of the ovary to release an egg during the menstru-al cycle occurs in about 70% of women with DUB. Thisis probably related to a hormonal imbalance.
DUB is common in women who have polycystic
ovary syndrome (cysts on the ovaries). Women who are
on dialysis may also have heavy or prolonged periods. Sodo some women who use an intrauterine device ( IUD )
for birth control.
DUB is similar to several other types of uterine bleed-
ing disorders and sometimes overlaps these conditions.
Menorrhagia

"Menorrhagia
Menorrhagia, sometimes called hypermenorrhea, is
another term for abnormally long, heavy periods. Thistype of period can be a symptom of DUB, or many otherdiseases or disorders. In menorrhagia, menstrual periodsoccur regularly, but last more than seven days, and bloodloss exceeds 3 oz (88.7 ml). Passing blood clots is com-mon. Between 15–20% of healthy women experiencedebilitating menorrhagia that interferes with their normalactivities. Menorrhagia may or may not signify a seriousunderlying problem.
Metrorrhagia
Metrorrhagia is bleeding between menstrual periods.
Bleeding is heavy and irregular as opposed to ovulatoryspotting which is light bleeding, in mid-cycle, at the timeof ovulation.
Polymenorrhea
Polymenorrhea describes the condition of having
too frequent periods. Periods occur more often thanevery 21 days, and ovulation usually does not occur dur-ing the cycle.
Causes and symptoms
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding often occurs when"
"Causes and symptoms
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding often occurs when
the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, is stimulated togrow by the hormone estrogen. When exposure to estro-gen is extended, or not balanced by the presence of prog-esterone, the endometrium continues to grow until it out-grows its blood supply. Then it sloughs off, causingirregular bleeding. If the bleeding is heavy enough and
frequent enough, anemia can result.
Menorrhagia is representative of DUB. It is caused
by many conditions including some outside the repro-ductive system. Causes of menorrhagia include:
• adenomyosis (a benign condition characterized by
growths in the area of the uterus)
• imbalance between the hormones estrogen and proges-
terone
• fibroid tumors
• pelvic infection•endometrial cancer (cancer of the inner mucous
membrane of the uterus)
• endometrial polyps•endometriosis (a condition in which endometrial or
endrometrial-like tissue appears outside of its normalplace in the uterus)"
"endrometrial-like tissue appears outside of its normalplace in the uterus)
• use of an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception
• hypothyroidism• blood clotting problems (rare)
• lupus erythematosus
• pelvic inflammatory disease• steroid therapy• advanced liver disease• renal (kidney) disease• chemotherapy (cancer treatment with chemicals)
To diagnose dysfunctional uterine bleeding, many of
the potential causes mentioned above must be eliminat-ed. When all potential causes connected with pregnancy,infection, and tumors (benign or malignant) are eliminat-ed, then menorrhagia is presumed to be caused by dys-functional uterine bleeding.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of any menstrual irregularity begins with"
"Diagnosis
Diagnosis of any menstrual irregularity begins with
the patient herself. The doctor will ask for a detaileddescription of the problem, and take a history of howlong it has existed, and any patterns the patient hasobserved. A woman can assist the doctor in diagnosingthe cause of abnormal uterine bleeding by keeping arecord of the time, frequency, length, and quantity ofbleeding. She should also tell the doctor about any ill-nesses, including long-standing conditions, like diabetes
mellitus . The doctor will also inquire about sexual activ-
ity, use of contraceptives, current medications, and pastsurgical procedures.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1112Dysfunctional uterine bleeding"
"Laboratory tests
After taking the woman’s history, the gynecologist
or family practitioner does a pelvic examination and Papsmear. To rule out specific causes of abnormal bleeding,the doctor may also do a pregnancy test and blood teststo check the level of thyroid hormone. Based on the ini-tial test results, the doctor may want to do tests to deter-mine the level of other hormones that play a role inreproduction. A test of blood clotting time and an adrenalfunction test are also commonly done.
Imaging
Imaging tests are important diagnostic tools for eval-
uating abnormal uterine bleeding. Ultrasound examina-tion of the pelvic and abdominal area is used to helplocate uterine fibroids , also called uterine leiomyoma, a
type of tumor. Visual examination through hysterscopy—where a camera inside a thin tube is inserted directly intothe uterus so that the doctor can see the uterine lining—isalso used to assess the condition of the uterus.
Hystersalpingography can help outline endometrial"
"Hystersalpingography can help outline endometrial
polyps and fibroids and help detect endometrial cancer.In this procedure an x ray is taken after contrast mediahas been injected into the cervix. Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of the pelvic region can also be used to
locate fibroids and tumors.
Invasive procedures
Endometrial biopsy (the removal and examination
of endometrial tissue) is the most important testing proce-dure. It allows the doctor to sample small areas of the uter-ine lining, while cervical biopsy allows the cervix to besampled. Tissues are then examined for any abnormalities.
Dilation and curettage (D & C), once common is
rarely done today for diagnosis of DUB. It is done whilethe patient is under either general or regional anesthesia.Women over 30 are more likely to need a D & C, as partof the diagnostic procedure, than younger women.

"Because DUB is diagnosed by eliminating other
possible disorders, diagnosis can take a long time andinvolve many tests and procedures. Older women arelikely to need more extensive tests than adolescentsbecause the likelihood of reproductive cancers is greaterin this age group, and therefore must be definitivelyeliminated before treating bleeding symptoms.
Treatment
Treatment of DUB depends on the cause of the
bleeding and the age of the patient. When the underlyingcause of the disorder is known, that disorder is treated.KEY TERMS
Dilation and curettage (D & C) —A procedure
performed under anesthesia during which thecervix is dilated, and tissue lining the uterus isscraped out with a metal spoon-shaped instrumentor a suction tube. The procedure can be eitherdiagnostic, or to remove polyps.
Endometrial biopsy —The removal of tissue either"
"Endometrial biopsy —The removal of tissue either
by suction or scraping of samples of tissue fromthe uterus. The cervix is not dilated. The procedurehas a lower rate of diagnostic accuracy than a D &C, but can be done as an office procedure underlocal anesthesia.
Endometrial cancer —Cancer of the inner mucous
membrane of the uterus.
Fibroids, or fibroid tumors —Fibroid tumors are
non-cancerous (benign) growths in the uterus.They occur in 30–40% of women over age 40,and do not need to be removed unless they arecausing symptoms that interfere with a woman’snormal activities.
Hypothyroidism —A disorder in which the thyroid
gland produces too little thyroid hormone causinga decrease in the rate of metabolism with associat-ed effects on the reproductive system.
Lupus erythematosus —A chronic inflammatory
disease in which inappropriate immune systemreactions cause abnormalities in the blood vesselsand connective tissue.
Progesterone —A hormone naturally secreted by"
"Progesterone —A hormone naturally secreted by
the ovary, or manufactured synthetically, thatprepares the uterus for implantation of a fertil-ized egg.
Prostaglandins —A group of chemicals that medi-
ate, or determine the actions of other chemicals inthe cell or body.
Otherwise the goal of treatment is to relieve the symp-
toms to a degree that uterine bleeding does not interferewith a woman’s normal activities or cause anemia.
Generally the first approach to controlling DUB is to
use oral contraceptives that provide a balance between
the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Oral contracep-tives are often very effective in adolescents and youngwomen in their twenties. NSAIDs ( nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs ), like Naprosyn and Motrin, are
also used to treat DUB.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1113Dysfunctional uterine bleeding"
"When bleeding cannot be controlled by hormone
treatment, surgery may be necessary. Dilation and curet-tage sometimes relieves the symptoms of DUB. If thatfails, endometrial ablation removes the uterine lining, butpreserves a woman’s uterus. This procedure is sometimesbe used instead of hysterectomy . However, as it affects
the uterus, it can only be used when a woman has com-pleted her childbearing years. The prescription of iron isalso important to decrease the risk of enemia.
Until the 1980s, hysterectomy often was used to
treat heavy uterine bleeding. Today hysterectomy is usedless frequently to treat DUB, and then only after othermethods of controlling the symptoms have failed. A hys-terectomy leaves a woman unable to bear children, and,therefore, is limited largely to women who are unable to,or uninterested in, bearing children. Still, hysterectomyis a common treatment for long-standing DUB in womendone with childbearing.
Alternative treatment"
"Alternative treatment
Alternative practitioners concentrate on good nutri-
tion as a way to prevent heavy periods that are not caused
by uterine fibroids, endometrial polyps, endometriosis, orcancer. Iron supplementation (100 mg per day) not onlyhelps prevent anemia, but also appears to reduce menor-rhagia in many women. Other recommended dietary sup-plements include vitamins A and C. Vitamin C improves
capillary fragility and enhances iron uptake.
Vitamin E and bioflavonoid supplements are also
recommended. Vitamin E can help reduce blood flow,and bioflavonoids help strengthen the capillaries. Vita-min K is known to play a role in clotting and is helpful insituations where heavy bleeding may be due to clottingabnormalities
Botanical medicines used to assist in treating abnor-
mal bleeding include spotted cranesbill ( Geranium macu-
latum ), birthroot ( Trillium pendulum ), blue cohosh
(Caulophyllum thalictroides ), witch hazel ( Hamamelis"
"(Caulophyllum thalictroides ), witch hazel ( Hamamelis
virginiana ), shepherd’s purse ( Capsella bursa-pastoris ),
and yarrow ( Achillea millifolia ). These are all stiptic
herbs that act to tighten blood vessels and tissue. Hor-monal balance can also be addressed with herbal formula-tions containing phytoestrogens and phytoprogesterone.
Prognosis
Response to treatment for DUB is highly individual
and is not easy to predict. The outcome depends largelyon the woman’s medical condition and her age. Manywomen, especially adolescents, are successfully treatedwith hormones (usually oral contraceptives). As a lastresort, hysterectomy removes the source of the problemby removing the uterus, but this operation is not without
risk, or the possibility of complications.
Prevention
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is not a preventable
disorder.

Dyslexia
Definition
Dyslexia is a learning disability characterized by
problems in reading, spelling, writing, speaking, or lis-tening. In many cases, dyslexia appears to be inherited.

dys(meaning poor or inadequate) and the word lexis
(meaning words or language).

"(meaning words or language).
The National Institutes of Health estimates that
about 15% of the United States population is affectedby learning disabilities, mostly with problems in lan-guage and reading. The condition appears in all ages,races, and income levels. Dyslexia is not a disease, butdescribes rather a different kind of mind that learns in adifferent way from other people. Many people with thecondition are gifted and very productive; dyslexia is notat all linked to low intelligence. In fact, intelligence hasnothing to do with dyslexia.
Dyslexic children seem to have trouble learning
early reading skills, problems hearing individual soundsin words, analyzing whole words in parts, and blendingsounds into words. Letters such as “d” and “b” may beconfused.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1114Dyslexia"
"When a person is dyslexic, there is often an unexpect-
ed difference between achievement and aptitude. However,each person with dyslexia has different strengths and weak-nesses, although many have unusual talents in art, athletics,architecture, graphics, drama, music, or engineering. Thesespecial talents are often in areas that require the ability tointegrate sight, spatial skills, and coordination.
Often, a person with dyslexia has a problem translat-
ing language into thought (such as in listening or read-ing), or translating thought into language (such as inwriting or speaking).
Common characteristics include problems with:
• identifying single words
• understanding sounds in words, sound order, or rhymes• spelling
• transposing letters in words
• handwriting
• reading comprehension
• delayed spoken language
• confusion with directions, or right/left handedness• confusion with opposites (up/down, early/late, and so on)

Causes and symptoms
The underlying cause of dyslexia is not known,
although research suggests the condition is often inherit-ed. In 1999, The Centre for Reading Research in Norwaypresented the first research to study the largest familywith reading problems ever known. By studying the read-ing and writing abilities of close to 80 family membersacross four generations the researchers reported, for thefirst time, that chromosome 2 can be involved in theinheritability of dyslexia. When a fault occurs on thisgene it leads to difficulties in processing written lan-guage. Previous studies have pointed out linkages of otherpotential dyslexia genes to chromosome 1, chromosome15 (DYX1 gene), and to chromosome 6 (DYX2 gene).The researchers who pinpointed the newly localized geneon chromosome 2 (DYX3) hope that this finding will leadto earlier and more precise diagnoses of dyslexia.

"people can read. Other experts believe that dyslexia is
related to differences in the structure and function of thebrain that manifests differently in different people.
Diagnosis
Anyone who is suspected to have dyslexia should
have a comprehensive evaluation, including hearing,vision, and intelligence testing. The test should includeall areas of learning and learning processes, not justreading.
As further research pinpoints the genes responsible
for some cases of dyslexia, there is a possibility that ear-lier testing will be established to allow for timely inter-ventions to prevent the onset of the condition and to treatit when it does occur.
Unfortunately, in many schools, a child is not identi-
fied as having dyslexia until after repeated failures.

"Treatment
If a child is diagnosed with dyslexia, the parents
should find out from the school or the diagnosticianexactly what the problem is, and what method of teach-ing is recommended and why. No single method willwork with every child, and experts often disagree as tothe best method to use.
The primary focus of treatment is aimed at helping
the specific learning problem of each affected person.Most often, this may include modifying teaching meth-ods and the educational environment, since traditionaleducational methods will not always work with a dyslex-ic child.
People with dyslexia need a structured language pro-
gram, with direct instruction in the letter-sound system.Teachers must give the rules governing written language.Most experts agree that the teacher should emphasize theassociation between simple phonetic units with letters orletter groups, rather than an approach that stresses mem-orizing whole words.

Many successful and even famous people have
dyslexia. How well a person with dyslexia functions inlife depends on the way the disability affects that person.There is a great deal of variation among different peoplewith dyslexia, producing different symptoms and differ-ent degrees of severity.
Prognosis is usually good if the condition is diag-
nosed early, and if the person has a strong self imagewith supportive family, friends, and teachers. It is imper-ative for a good outcome that the person be involved in agood remedial program.

Dysmenorrhea

dysmenorrhea (cramps), a dull or throbbing pain that

"Causes and symptoms
Dysmenorrhea is called “primary” when there is no
specific abnormality, and “secondary” when the pain iscaused by an underlying gynecological problem. It isbelieved that primary dysmenorrhea occurs when hor-mone-like substances called “prostaglandins” producedby uterine tissue trigger strong muscle contractions in theuterus during menstruation. However, the level ofprostaglandins doesn’t seem to have anything to do withhow strong a woman’s cramps are. Some women havehigh levels of prostaglandins and no cramps, whereasother women with low levels have severe cramps. This iswhy experts assume that cramps must also be related toother things (such as genetics, stress , and different body
types) in addition to prostaglandins. The first year or two ofa girl’s periods are not usually very painful. However, onceovulation begins, the blood levels of the prostaglandinsrise, leading to stronger contractions.
Secondary dysmenorrhea may be caused by endo-"
"Secondary dysmenorrhea may be caused by endo-
metriosis , fibroid tumors, or an infection in the pelvis.
The likelihood that a woman will have cramps
increases if she:
• has a family history of painful periods
• leads a stressful life• doesn’t get enough exercise
• uses caffeine
• has pelvic inflammatory disease
Symptoms include a dull, throbbing cramping in the
lower abdomen that may radiate to the lower back andthighs. In addition, some women may experience nausea
and vomiting ,diarrhea , irritability, sweating, or dizzi-
ness. Cramps usually last for two or three days at the
beginning of each menstrual period. Many women oftennotice their painful periods disappear after they havetheir first child, probably due to the stretching of theopening of the uterus or because the birth improves theuterine blood supply and muscle activity.

A doctor should perform a thorough pelvic exam
and take a patient history to rule out an underlying condi-tion that could cause cramps.KEY TERMS"

Treatment
Secondary dysmenorrhea is controlled by treating
the underlying disorder.
Several drugs can lessen or completely eliminate
the pain of primary dysmenorrhea. The most popularchoice are the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs"
"(NSAIDs), which prevent or decrease the formation ofprostaglandins. These include aspirin , ibuprofen
(Advil), and naproxen (Aleve). For more severe pain,prescription strength ibuprofen (Motrin) is available.These drugs are usually begun at the first sign of theperiod and taken for a day or two. There are many dif-ferent types of NSAIDs, and women may find that oneworks better for them than the others.
If an NSAID is not available, acetaminophen
(Tylenol) may also help ease the pain. Heat applied to thepainful area may bring relief, and a warm bath twice aday also may help. While birth control pills will ease thepain of dysmenorrhea because they lead to lower hor-mone levels, they are not usually prescribed just for pain
management unless the woman also wants to use them
as a birth control method. This is because these pills maycarry other more significant side effects and risks.

menstrual pain. In the “cat stretch,” position, the womanrests on her hands and knees, slowly arching the back.The pelvic tilt is another popular yoga position, in whichthe woman lies with knees bent, and then lifts the pelvisand buttocks.
Dietary recommendations to ease cramps include
increasing fiber, calcium, and complex carbohydrates,cutting fat, red meat, dairy products, caffeine, salt, andsugar. Smoking also has been found to worsen cramps.
Recent research suggests that vitamin B supplements,primarily vitamin B
6in a complex, magnesium, and fish
oil supplements (omega-3 fatty acids) also may helprelieve cramps.

"Other women find relief through visualization, con-
centrating on the pain as a particular color and gainingcontrol of the sensations. Aromatherapy and massage
may ease pain for some women. Others find that imagin-ing a white light hovering over the painful area can actu-ally lessen the pain for brief periods.
Exercise may be a way to reduce the pain of men-
strual cramps through the brain’s production of endor-phins, the body’s own painkillers. And orgasm can makea woman feel more comfortable by releasing tension inthe pelvic muscles.
Acupuncture and Chinese herbs are another popu-
lar alternative treatments for cramps.
Prognosis
Medication should lessen or eliminate pain.
Prevention
NSAIDs taken a day before the period begins should
eliminate cramps for some women.

"Dyspepsia
Definition
Dyspepsia can be defined as painful, difficult, or dis-
turbed digestion, which may be accompanied by symp-toms such as nausea and vomiting ,heartburn , bloat-
ing, and stomach discomfort.
Causes and symptoms
The digestive problems may have an identifiable
cause, such as bacterial or viral infection, peptic ulcer,gallbladder, or liver disease. The bacteria Helicobacter
pylori is often found in those individuals suffering from
duodenal or gastric ulcers. Investigation of recurrentindigestion should rule out these possible causes.

"Often, there is no organic cause for the problem, in
which case dyspepsia is classified as functional or nonul-cer dyspepsia. There is evidence that functional dyspepsiamay be related to abnormal motility of the upper gastroin-testinal tract (a state known as dysmotility in which theesophagus, stomach, and upper intestine behave abnor-mally). These patients may respond to a group of drugscalled prokinate agents. A review of eating habits (e.g.chewing with the mouth open, gulping food, or talkingwhile chewing) may reveal a tendency to swallow air. Thismay contribute to feeling bloated, or to excessive belching.Smoking ,caffeine , alcohol, or carbonated beverages may
contribute to the discomfort. When there is sensitivity orallergy to certain food substances, eating those foods maycause gastrointestinal distress. Some medications are asso-ciated with indigestion. Stomach problems may also be aresponse to stress or emotional unrest.

A physical examination by a health care profes-
sional may reveal mid-abdominal pain . A rectal exami-
nation may be done to rule out bleeding. If blood is
found on rectal exam, laboratory studies, including ablood count may be ordered. Endoscopy and barium
studies may be used to rule out underlying gastrointesti-nal disease. Upper gastrointestinal x-ray studies usingbarium may allow for visualization of abnormalities.Endoscopy permits collection of tissue and culture speci-mens which may be used to further confirm a diagnosis.

"Treatment
The treatment of dyspepsia is based on assessment
of symptoms and suspected causative factors. Clinicalevaluation is aimed at distinguishing those patients whorequire immediate diagnostic work-ups from those whocan safely benefit from more conservative initial treat-ment. Some of the latter may require only reassurance,dietary modifications, or antacid use. Medications toblock production of stomach acids, prokinate agents, orantibiotic treatment may be considered. Further diagnos-tic investigation is indicated if there is severe abdominalpain, pain radiating to the back, unexplained weight loss,difficulty swallowing, a palpable mass, or anemia. Addi-tional work-up is also indicated if a patient does notrespond to prescribed medications.

Ear exam with an otoscope
Definition
An otoscope is a hand-held instrument with a tiny
light and a cone-shaped attachment called an ear specu-lum, which is used to examine the ear canal. An earexamination is a normal part of most physical examina-tions by a doctor or nurse. It is also done when an earinfection or other type of ear problem is suspected.
Purpose
An otoscope is used to look into the ear canal to see
the ear drum. Redness or fluid in the eardrum can indi-cate an ear infection. Some otoscopes can deliver a smallpuff of air to the eardrum to see if the eardrum willvibrate (which is normal). This type of ear examinationwith an otoscope can also detect a build up of wax in theear canal, or a rupture or puncture of the eardrum.

Description
An ear examination with an otoscope is usually done
by a doctor or a nurse as part of a complete physicalexamination . The ears may also be examined if an ear
infection is suspected due to fever , ear pain, or hearing
loss. The patient will often be asked to tip the head
slightly toward the shoulder so the ear to be examined ispointing up. The doctor or nurse may hold the ear lobe asthe speculum is inserted into the ear, and may adjust theposition of the otoscope to get a better view of the earcanal and eardrum. Both ears are usually examined, evenif there seems to be a problem with just one ear.

"Preparation
No special preparation is required prior to an ear
examination with an otoscope. The ear speculum, whichis inserted into the ear, is cleaned and sanitized before itis used. The speculums come in various sizes, and thedoctor or nurse will select the size that will be most com-fortable for the patient’s ear.
Aftercare
If an ear infection is diagnosed, the patient may
require treatment with antibiotics . If there is a buildup of
wax in the ear canal, it might be rinsed or scraped out.
Risks
This type of ear examination is simple and generally
harmless. Caution should always be used any time anobject is inserted into the ear. This process could irritatean infected external ear canal and could rupture aneardrum if performed improperly or if the patient moves.

Abnormal results
An ear infection will cause the eardrum to look red
and swollen. In cases where the eardrum has ruptured,there may be fluid draining from the middle ear. A doctormay also see scarring, retraction of the eardrum, orbulging of the eardrum.

"otics don’t work or when ear infections are chronic. The
process normalizes pressure in the middle ear anddecreases fluid accumulation. It is most commonly per-formed on infants and children, in whom ear infectionsare most frequent, and may be done on one or both ears.The surgeon makes a small hole in the ear drum, thenuses suction to remove fluid. A small ear tube of metal orplastic is inserted into the ear drum to allow continualdrainage. The tube prevents infections as long as it staysin place, which varies from six months to three years.When the tube falls out, the hole grows over. As many of25% of children under the age of two who need ear tubesmay need them again. Myringotomy and ear tube surgeryis performed in a hospital, using a general anesthetic formost children and a local anesthetic for older children oradults. No anesthetic may be used for infants. The proce-dure usually takes about two hours. Most patients can gohome the same day; children under three years of age and"

Ear surgery for a perforated eardrum
Ear surgery for a perforated eardrum is only per-
formed in rare cases where it does not heal on its own. Inmost cases, this is performed in a surgeon’s office using atopical anesthetic. The surgeon scratches the undersur-face of the eardrum, stimulating the skin to heal and theeardrum to close.

If the tumor is near the eardrum, the skin of the ear canaland the eardrum are removed along with the bone sur-rounding the ear canal. A skin graft is placed on the barebone. For basal cell cancers and low grade glandularmalignancies, surgical resection of the ear canal is ade-quate. Squamous cell carcinoma, a serious form of can-

Echinacea
Definition
Echinacea, or purple coneflower, is a perennial herb
of the Composite family, commonly known as the daisyfamily. Most often referred to as the purple coneflower,this hardy plant also known as Sampson root, Missourisnakeroot, and rudbeckia. The prominent, bristly seedhead inspired the generic name of the plant, taken fromthe Greek word echinos meaning hedgehog.

"Description
Echinacea is a North American prairie native, abun-
dant in the Midwest, and cultivated widely in ornamentaland medicinal gardens. The purple-pink rays of the blos-som droop downward from a brassy hued center conecomposed of many small, tubular florets. The conspicu-ous flowers bloom singly on stout, prickly stems frommid-summer to autumn. Flower heads may grow to 4 in(10.16 cm) across. The dark green leaves are opposite,entire, lanceolate, toothed, and hairy with three promi-nent veins. The narrow upper leaves are attached to thestem with stalks. The lower leaves are longer, emergingfrom the stem without a leaf stalk, and growing to 8 in(20.32 cm) in length. The plant develops deep, slender,black roots. Echinacea propagates easily from seed or byroot cuttings. However, due to its increasing popularityas an herbal supplement, echinacea is numbered amongthe 19 medicinal plants considered at risk by the Vermontnonprofit organization, United Plant Savers.
Purpose"
"Purpose
Three species of echinacea are useful medicinally:
Echinacea augustifolia, Echinacea purpurea , and Echi-nacea pallida . The entire plant has numerous medicinal
properties that act synergistically to good effect. Echi-nacea is most often used to boost the immune system andfight infection. Research has shown that echinaceaincreases production of interferon in the body. It is anti-septic and antimicrobial, with properties that act toincrease the number of white blood cells available todestroy bacteria and slow the spread of infection. As adepurative, the herbal extract cleanses and purifies thebloodstream, and has been used effectively to treat boils ."
"Echinacea is vulnerary, promoting wound healing throughthe action of a chemical substance in the root known ascaffeic acid glycoside. As an alterative and an immuno-modulator, echinacea acts gradually to promote beneficialchange in the entire system. It has also been used to treaturinary infection and Candida albicans infections. Echi-
nacea is a febrifuge, useful in reducing fevers. It is alsouseful in the treatment of hemorrhoids . A tincture, or a
strong decoction of echinacea serves as an effectivemouthwash for the treatment of pyorrhea and gingivitis.
Native American plains Indians relied on echinacea"
"Native American plains Indians relied on echinacea
as an all-purpose antiseptic. The Sioux tribe valued theroot as a remedy for snake bite, the Cheyenne tribechewed the root to quench thirst, and another tribewashed their hands in a decoction of echinacea toincrease their tolerance of heat. European settlers learnedof the North American herb’s many uses, and soonnumerous echinacea-based remedies were commerciallyavailable from pharmaceutical companies in the UnitedStates. Echinacea was a popular remedy in the UnitedStates through the 1930s. It was among many medicinalherbs listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia , the official Unit-
ed States government listing of pharmaceutical rawmaterials and recipes. The herb fell out of popular use inthe United States with the availability of antibiotics . In
West Germany, over 200 preparations are made from thespecies E. purpurea . Commercially prepared salves, tinc-"
"tures, teas, and extracts are marketed using standardizedextracts. Echinacea is regaining its status in the UnitedStates as a household medicine-chest staple in manyhomes. It is one of the best-selling herbal supplements inUnited States health food stores.
Clinical studies have found that the entire plant pos-
sesses medicinal properties with varying levels of effec-tiveness. Echinacea is of particular benefit in the treatmentof upper respiratory tract infections. Some research hasshown that echinacea activates the macrophages thatdestroy cancer cells and pathogens. When taken after can-
cer treatments, an extract of the root has been found toincrease the body’s production of white blood cells. Echi-nacea has been shown to be most effective when taken atthe first sign of illness, rather than when used as a dailypreventative. Other research has demonstrated the signifi-

and severity of colds and flu. Some herbal references listonly the root as the medicinal part, others include the aeri-al parts of the plant, particularly the leaf. But researchstudies in Europe and the United States have concludedthat the entire plant is medicinally effective. Most researchhas been done on the species E. pallida and E. purpurea .
All three species of echinacea are rich in vitamins and
minerals . Echinacea is an herbal source of niacin, chromi-
um, iron, manganese, selenium, silicon, and zinc.

Echinococcosis
Definition
Echinococcosis (Hydatid disease) refers to human
infection by the immature (larval) form of tapeworm,Echinococcus . One of three forms of the Echinococcus
spp., E. granulosus , lives on dogs and livestock, and
infects humans through contact with these animals. Aller-gic reactions and damage to various organs from cyst for-mation are the most common forms of disease in humans.
Description
E. granulosus is found in many areas of Africa,
China, South America, Australia, New Zealand, andMediterranean and eastern Europe, as well as in parts ofthe western United States. The parasite lives in regionswhere dogs and livestock cohabitate.

Definition
Echocardiography is a diagnostic test that uses ultra-
sound waves to create an image of the heart muscle.Ultrasound waves that rebound or echo off the heart canshow the size, shape, and movement of the heart’s valvesand chambers as well as the flow of blood through theheart. Echocardiography may show such abnormalitiesas poorly functioning heart valves or damage to the hearttissue from a past heart attack .

"Purpose
Echocardiography is used to diagnose certain cardio-
vascular diseases. In fact, it is one of the most widely useddiagnostic tests for heart disease. It can provide a wealthof helpful information, including the size and shape of theheart, its pumping strength, and the location and extent ofany damage to its tissues. It is especially useful for assess-ing diseases of the heart valves. It not only allows doctorsto evaluate the heart valves, but it can detect abnormalitiesin the pattern of blood flow, such as the backward flow ofblood through partly closed heart valves, known as regur-gitation. By assessing the motion of the heart wall,echocardiography can help detect the presence and assessthe severity of coronary artery disease , as well as help
determine whether any chest pain is related to heart dis-
ease. Echocardiography can also help detect hypertrophic

"cardiomyopathy , in which the walls of the heart thicken
in an attempt to compensate for heart muscle weakness.The biggest advantage to echocardiography is that it isnoninvasive (doesn’t involve breaking the skin or enteringbody cavities) and has no known risks or side effects.

and no special precautions are required.Description

The transducer, a small hand-helddevice at the end of a flexible cable, is placed against thechest. Essentially a modified microphone, the transducerdirects ultrasound waves into the chest. Some of thewaves get echoed (or reflected) back to the transducer.Since different tissues and blood all reflect ultrasoundwaves differently, these sound waves can be translatedinto a meaningful image of the heart, which can be dis-played on a monitor or recorded on paper or tape. Thepatient does not feel the sound waves, and the entire pro-cedure is painless. In fact, there are no known side effects.

"Occasionally, variations of the echocardiography
test are used. For example, Doppler echocardiographyemploys a special microphone that allows technicians tomeasure and analyze the direction and speed of bloodflow through blood vessels and heart valves.

By assessing the speed ofblood flow at different locations around an obstruction, itcan also help to precisely locate the obstruction.

Ectopic pregnancy
Definition
In an ectopic pregnancy , the fertilized egg implants in
a location outside the uterus and tries to develop there. Theword ectopic means “in an abnormal place or position.” Themost common site is the fallopian tube, the tube that nor-mally carries eggs from the ovary to the uterus. However,ectopic pregnancy can also occur in the ovary, the abdomen,and the cervical canal (the opening from the uterus to thevaginal canal). The phrases tubal pregnancy, ovarian preg-nancy, cervical pregnancy, and abdominal pregnancy referto the specific area of an ectopic pregnancy.
Description"
"Description
Once a month, an egg is produced in a woman’s ovary
and travels down the fallopian tube where it meets themale’s sperm and is fertilized. In a normal pregnancy thefertilized egg, or zygote, continues on its passage down thefallopian tube and enters the uterus in three to five days.The zygote continues to grow, implanting itself securely inthe wall of the uterus. The zygote’s cells develop into theembryo (the organism in its first two months of develop-

"ment) and placenta (a spongy structure that lines the uterus
and nourishes the developing organism).
In a tubal ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg can-
not make it all the way down the tube because of scarringor obstruction. The fallopian tube is too narrow for thegrowing zygote. Eventually the thin walls of the tubestretch and may burst (rupture), resulting in severe bleed-ing and possibly the death of the mother. More than 95%
percent of all ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopiantube. Only 1.5% develop in the abdomen; less than 1%develop in the ovary or the cervix.
Causes and symptoms
As many as 50% of women with ectopic pregnancies
have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).
This is an infection of the fallopian tubes (salpingitis)that can spread to the uterus or ovaries. It is most com-monly caused by the organisms Gonorrhea and Chlamy-
diaand is usually transmitted by sexual intercourse.
Other conditions also increase the risk of ectopic

"Other conditions also increase the risk of ectopic
pregnancy. They include:
•Endometriosis . A condition in which the tissue that
normally lines the uterus is found outside the uterus,and can block a fallopian tube.
• Exposure to diethylsilbestrol (DES) as a fetus. If a
woman’s mother took DES (a synthetic version of thehormone estrogen) during pregnancy, the woman mayhave abnormalities in her fallopian tubes that can makeectopic pregnancy more likely.

"• Taking hormones. Estrogen and progesterone are hor-
mones that regulate the menstrual cycle and may be inmedications prescribed by a doctor for birth control orother reasons. Taking these hormones can affect the inte-rior lining of the fallopian tubes and slow the movementof the fertilized egg down the tube. Women who becomepregnant in spite of taking some progesterone-only con-traceptives have a greater chance of an ectopic pregnan-cy. Ectopic pregnancy is also more likely when theovaries are artificially stimulated with hormones to pro-duce eggs for in vitro fertilization (a procedure in which
eggs are taken from a woman’s body, fertilized, and thenplaced in the uterus in an attempt to conceive a child).

"• Use of an intrauterine device ( IUD). These contracep-
tive devices are designed to prevent fertilized eggs frombecoming implanted in the uterus, but they have only aminimal effect on preventing ectopic pregnancies.Therefore, if a woman becomes pregnant while usingan IUD for contraception , the fertilized egg is more
likely to be implanted someplace other than the uterus.For example, among women who become pregnantwhile using a progesterone-bearing IUD, about 15%have ectopic pregnancies.• Surgery on a fallopian tube. The risk of ectopic preg-
nancy can be as high as 60% after undergoing electivetubal sterilization, a procedure in which the fallopiantubes are severed to prevent pregnancy. Women whohave successful surgery to reverse the procedure arealso more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy.
Early symptoms
In an ectopic pregnancy all the hormonal changes
associated with a normal pregnancy may occur. The earlysymptoms include: fatigue ; nausea; a missed period; breast"
"tenderness; low back pain ; mild cramping on one side of
the pelvis; and abnormal vaginal bleeding, usually spotting.
Later symptoms
As the embryo grows too large for the confined
space in the tube, the first sign that something is wrongmay be a stabbing pain in the pelvis or abdomen. If the
tube has ruptured, blood may irritate the diaphragm andcause shoulder pain. Other warning signs are lighthead-edness and fainting .
Diagnosis
To confirm an early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy,
the doctor must determine first that the patient is preg-nant and that the location of the embryo is outside theuterus. If an ectopic pregnancy is suspected, the doctor

pain and to detect a mass in the abdomen.
Several laboratory tests of the patient’s blood pro-
vide information for diagnosis. Measurement of thehuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level in thepatient’s blood serum is the most useful laboratory test inthe early stages. In a normal pregnancy, the level of thishormone doubles about every two days during the first10 weeks. In an ectopic pregnancy, the rate of theincrease is much slower and the low hCG for the stage ofthe pregnancy is a strong indication that the pregnancy isabnormal. (It could also represent a miscarriage in
progress.) The level is usually tested several times over aperiod of days to determine whether or not it is increas-ing at a normal rate.
Progesterone levels in the blood are also measured.
Lower than expected levels can indicate that the pregnan-cy is not normal.

If the ectopic pregnancy is discovered in a very early

When the pregnancy has ruptured, a surgical inci-
sion into the abdomen, or laparotomy, is performed to

"stop the immediate loss of blood and to remove the

Alternative treatment
Ectopic pregnancy was first described in the eleventh
century and was a potentially fatal condition until theadvent of surgery and blood transfusions in the earlytwentieth century. The sophisticated diagnostic tools andsurgical procedures developed since the 1970s haveequipped modern medicine with the tools to not only savea woman’s life, but also to preserve her future fertility.
Although there are herbal remedies for the tempo-
rary relief of the common symptoms of anxiety and
abdominal discomfort, prompt medical treatment is theonly sure remedy for ectopic pregnancy.

"Prognosis
Ectopic pregnancies are the leading cause of preg-
nancy-related deaths in the first trimester and account for9% of all pregnancy-related deaths in the United States.More than 1% of pregnancies are ectopic, and they arebecoming more common. The reason for this increase isnot clearly understood, though it is thought that the dra-matic increase in sexually transmitted diseases (STD)
is at least partly responsible.
The earlier an ectopic pregnancy is diagnosed and
treated, the better the outcome. The chances of having asuccessful pregnancy are lower after an ectopic pregnan-cy, but depend on the extent of permanent fallopian tubedamage. If the tube has been spared, chances are as highas 60%. The chances of a successful pregnancy after theremoval of one tube are 40%.

"Description
Normally the body maintains a balance of fluid in
tissues by ensuring that the same of amount of waterentering the body also leaves it. The circulatory systemtransports fluid within the body via its network of bloodvessels. The fluid, which contains oxygen and nutrientsneeded by the cells, moves from the walls of the bloodvessels into the body’s tissues. After its nutrients are usedup, fluid moves back into the blood vessels and returns tothe heart. The lymphatic system (a network of channelsin the body that carry lymph, a colorless fluid containingwhite blood cells to fight infection) also absorbs andtransports this fluid. In edema, either too much fluidmoves from the blood vessels into the tissues, or notenough fluid moves from the tissues back into the bloodvessels. This fluid imbalance can cause mild to severeswelling in one or more parts of the body.

"Many ordinary factors can upset the balance of fluid
in the body to cause edema, including:
• Immobility. The leg muscles normally contract and
compress blood vessels to promote blood flow withwalking or running. When these muscles are not used,

"blood can collect in the veins, making it difficult for
fluid to move from tissues back into the vessels.
• Heat. Warm temperatures cause the blood vessels to
expand, making it easier for fluid to cross into sur-rounding tissues. High humidity also aggravates thissituation.
• Medications. Certain drugs, such as steroids, hormone
replacements, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), and some blood pressure medications mayaffect how fast fluid leaves blood vessels.
• Intake of salty foods. The body needs a constant con-
centration of salt in its tissues. When excess salt istaken in, the body dilutes it by retaining fluid.
• Menstruation and pregnancy . The changing levels of
hormones affect the rate at which fluid enters andleaves the tissues.

"including:
•Heart failure . When the heart is unable to maintain
adequate blood flow throughout the circulatory system,the excess fluid pressure within the blood vessels cancause shifts into the interstitial spaces. Left-sided heart
failure can cause pulmonary edema , as fluid shifts into
the lungs. The patient may develop rapid, shallow res-pirations, shortness of breath , and a cough . Right-
sided heart failure can cause pitting edema, a swellingin the tissue under the skin of the lower legs and feet.Pressing this tissue with a finger tip leads to a notice-able momentary indentation.
• Kidney disease. The decrease in sodium and water
excretion can result in fluid retention and overload.
• Thyroid or liver disease. These conditions can change
the concentration of protein in the blood, affecting fluidmovement in and out of the tissues. In advanced liverdisease, the liver is enlarged and fluid may build-up inthe abdomen.

"• Blood clots. Clots can cause pooling of fluid and may
be accompanied by discoloration and pain . In some
instances, clots may cause no pain.
• Weakened veins. Varicose veins , or veins whose walls
or valves are weak, can allow blood to pool in the legs.This is a common condition.
• Infection and inflammation. Infection in leg tissues can
cause inflammation and increasing blood flow to thearea. Inflammatory diseases, such as gout or arthritis,
can also result in swelling.
•Lymphedema . Blocked lymph channels may be caused
by infection, scar tissue, or hereditary conditions.Lymph that can’t drain properly results in edema. Lym-phedema may also occur after cancer treatments, when
the lymph system is impaired by surgery, radiation, orchemotherapy .

"Symptoms vary depending on the cause of edema. In
general, weight gain, puffy eyelids, and swelling of thelegs may occur as a result of excess fluid volume. Pulserate and blood pressure may be elevated. Hand and neckveins may be observed as fuller.
Diagnosis
Edema is a sign of an underlying problem, rather
than a disease unto itself. A diagnostic explanationshould be sought. Patient history and presenting symp-toms, along with laboratory blood studies, if indicated,assist the health professional in determining the cause ofthe edema.
Treatment
Treatment of edema is based on the cause. Simple
steps to lessen fluid build-up may include:
• Reducing sodium intake. A high sodium level causes or
aggravates fluid retention.
• Maintaining proper weight. Being overweight slows
body fluid circulation and puts extra pressure on theveins.
•Exercise . Regular exercise stimulates circulation.

"• Elevation of the legs. Placing the legs at least 12 in
(30.5 cm) above the level of the heart for 10–15 min-utes, three to four times a day, stimulates excess fluidre-entry into the circulatory system.
• Use of support stocking. Elastic stockings, available at
most medical supply or drug stores, will compress theleg vessels, promoting circulation and decreasing pool-ing of fluid due to gravity.KEY TERMS

sugar, dairy products, soy sauce, animal protein, choco-late, olives, and pickles, should be avoided. Diuretic herbscan also help relieve edema. One of the best herbs for thispurpose is dandelion ( Taraxacum mongolicum ), since, in
addition to its diuretic action, it is a rich source of potassi-um. (Diuretics flush potassium from the body and it mustbe replaced to avoid potassium deficiency.) Hydrothera-

Edwards’ syndrome
Definition
Edwards’ syndrome is caused by an extra copy of
chromosome 18. For this reason, it is also called trisomy 18syndrome. The extra chromosome is lethal for most babiesborn with this condition. It causes major physical abnor-malities and severe mental retardation , and very few chil-
dren afflicted with this disease survive beyond a year.
Description
Humans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
Chromosomes are numbered 1–22, and the 23rd pair iscomposed of the sex chromosomes, X and Y . A personinherits one set of 23 chromosomes from each parent.Occasionally, a genetic error occurs during egg orsperm cell formation. A child conceived with such anegg or sperm cell may inherit an incorrect number ofchromosomes.
In the case of Edwards’ syndrome, the child inherits"
"In the case of Edwards’ syndrome, the child inherits
three, rather than two, copies of chromosome 18. Trisomy18 occurs in approximately one in every 3,000 newbornsand affects girls more often than boys. Women older thantheir early thirties have a greater risk of conceiving a childwith trisomy 18, but it can occur in younger women.
Causes and symptoms
A third copy of chromosome 18 causes numerous
abnormalities. Most children born with Edwards’ syn-drome appear weak and fragile, and they are often under-weight. The head is unusually small and the back of thehead is prominent. The ears are malformed and low-set,and the mouth and jaw are small. The baby may alsohave a cleft lip or cleft palate. Frequently, the hands areclenched into fists, and the index finger overlaps theother fingers. The child may have clubfeet and toes maybe webbed or fused.
Numerous problems involving the internal organs"
"Numerous problems involving the internal organs
may be present. Abnormalities often occur in the lungsand diaphragm (the muscle that controls breathing), andheart defects and blood vessel malformations are com-mon. The child may also have malformed kidneys andabnormalities of the urogenital system.
Diagnosis
Physical abnormalities point to Edwards’ syndrome,
but definitive diagnosis relies on karyotyping. Karyotyp-ing involves drawing the baby’s blood or bone marrowfor a microscopic examination of the chromosomes.Using special stains and microscopy, individual chromo-somes are identified, and the presence of an extra chro-mosome 18 is revealed.
Trisomy 18 can be detected before birth. If a preg-"
"Trisomy 18 can be detected before birth. If a preg-
nant woman is older than 35, has a family history ofgenetic abnormalities, has previously conceived a childwith a genetic abnormality, or has suffered earlier miscar-riages, she may undergo tests to determine whether herchild carries genetic abnormalities. Potential tests includematernal serum analysis or screening, ultrasonography,amniocentesis , and chorionic villus sampling .
Treatment
There is no cure for Edwards’ syndrome. Since tri-
somy 18 babies frequently have major physical abnor-malities, doctors and parents face difficult choicesregarding treatment. Abnormalities can be treated to acertain degree with surgery, but extreme invasive proce-dures may not be in the best interests of an infant whoselifespan is measured in days or weeks. Medical therapyoften consists of supportive care with the goal of makingthe infant comfortable, rather than prolonging life."
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1136Edwards’ syndromeGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1136
"Prognosis
Most children born with trisomy 18 die within their
first year of life. The average lifespan is less than twomonths for 50% of the children, and 90–95% die beforetheir first birthday. The 5–10% of children who survivetheir first year are severely mentally retarded. They needsupport to walk, and learning is limited. Verbal commu-nication is also limited, but they can learn to recognizeand interact with others.
Prevention
Edwards’ syndrome cannot be prevented.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Definition
The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) refer to a
group of inherited disorders that affect collagen structureand function. Genetic abnormalities in the manufacturingof collagen within the body affect connective tissues,causing them to be abnormally weak.

"skin, tendons, organ walls, cartilage, and blood vessels.
Each of these connective tissues requires collagen tai-lored to meet its specific purposes. The many roles ofcollagen are reflected in the number of genes dedicatedto its production. There are at least 28 genes in humansthat encode at least 19 different types of collagen. Muta-tions in these genes can affect basic construction as wellas the fine-tuned processing of the collagen.
EDS was originally described by Dr. Van Meekeren
in 1682. Dr. Ehlers and Dr. Danlos further characterizedthe disease in 1901 and 1908, respectively. Today,according to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation, onein 5,000 to one in 10,000 people are affected by someform of EDS.

"EDS is a group of genetic disorders that usually
affects the skin, ligaments, joints, and blood vessels. Clas-sification of EDS types was revised in 1997. The newclassification involves categorizing the different forms ofEDS into six major sub-types, including classical, hyper-mobility, vascular, kyphoscoliosis, arthrochalasia, anddermatosparaxis, and a collection of rare or poorlydefined varieties. This new classification is simpler andbased more on descriptions of the actual symptoms.
Classical type
Under the old classification system, EDS classical
type was divided into two separate types: type I and typeII. The major symptoms involved in EDS classical typeare the skin and joints. The skin has a smooth, velvetytexture and bruises easily. Affected individuals typically"
"have extensive scaring, particularly at the knees, elbows,forehead, and chin. The joints are hyperextensible, givinga tendency towards dislocation of the hip, shoulder,elbow, knee, or clavicle. Due to decreased muscle tone,affected infants may experience a delay in reaching motormilestones. Children may have a tendency to develop her-nias or other organ shifts within the abdomen. Sprains andpartial or complete joint dilocations are also common.Symptoms can range from mild to severe. EDS classicaltype is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
There are three major clinical diagnostic criteria for
EDS classical type. These include skin hyperextensibili-ty, unusually wide scars, and joint hypermobility. At thistime there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of classi-cal EDS. Both DNA and biochemical studies have beenused to help identify affected individuals. In some cases,a skin biopsy has been found to be useful in confirming"
"a diagnosis. Unfortunately, these tests are not sensitiveenough to identify all individuals with classical EDS. Ifthere are multiple affected individuals in a family, it maybe possible to perform prenatal diagnosis using a DNAinformation technique known as a linkage study.Hypermobility type
Excessively loose joints are the hallmark of this EDS
type, formerly known as EDS type III. Both large joints,such as the elbows and knees, and small joints, such astoes and fingers, are affected. Partial and total joint dislo-cations are common, and particularly involve the jaw,knee, and shoulder. Many individuals experience chroniclimb and joint pain, although x rays of these joints appear
normal. The skin may also bruise easily. Osteoarthritis is
a common occurrence in adults. EDS hypermobility typeis inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

"There are two major clinical diagnostic criteria for
EDS hypermobility type. These include skin involvement(either hyperextensible skin or smooth and velvety skin)and generalized joint hypermobility. At this time there isno test for this form of EDS.
V ascular type
Formerly called EDS type IV, EDS vascular type is
the most severe form. The connective tissue in theintestines, arteries, uterus, and other hollow organs maybe unusually weak, leading to organ or blood vessel rup-ture. Such ruptures are most likely between ages 20 and40, although they can occur any time, and may be life-threatening.
There is a classic facial appearance associated with
EDS vascular type. Affected individuals tend to havelarge eyes, a thin pinched nose, thin lips, and a slim body.The skin is thin and translucent, with veins dramaticallyvisible, particularly across the chest.

"The large joints have normal stability, but small
joints in the hands and feet are loose, showing hyperex-tensibility. The skin bruises easily. Other complicationsmay include collapsed lungs, premature aging of the skin
on the hands and feet, and ruptured arteries and veins.After surgery there tends to be poor wound healing, acomplication that tends to be frequent and severe. Preg-
nancy also carries the risk complications. During and
after pregnancy there is an increased risk of the uterusrupturing and of arterial bleeding. Due to the severe com-plications associated with EDS type IV , death usually
occurs before the fifth decade. A study of 419 individualswith EDS vascular type, completed in 2000, found thatthe median survival rate was 48 years, with a range of sixto 73 years. EDS vascular type is inherited in an autoso-mal dominant manner.

"There are four major clinical diagnostic criteria for
EDS vascular type. These include thin translucent skin,arterial/intestinal/uterine fragility or rupture, extensivebruising, and characteristic facial appearance. EDS vascu-lar type is caused by a change in the gene COL3A1,

Collage type III. Laboratory testing is available for thisform of EDS. A skin biopsy may be used to demonstratethe structurally abnormal collagen. This type of biochem-ical test identifies more than 95% of individuals with EDSvascular type. Laboratory testing is recommended forindividuals with two or more of the major criteria.
DNA analysis may als be used to identify the change
within the COL3A1 gene. This information may be help-ful for genetic counseling purposes. Prenatal testing is
available for pregnancies in which an affected parent hasbeen identified and their DNA mutation is known or theirbiochemical defect has been demonstrated.
Kyphoscoliosis type
The major symptoms of kyphoscoliosis type, for-
merly called EDS type VI, are general joint looseness. Atbirth, the muscle tone is poor, and motor skill develop-ment is subsequently delayed. Also, infants with this typeof EDS have an abnormal curvature of the spine ( scolio-"
"sis). The scoliosis becomes progressively worse with
age, with affected individuals usually unable to walk byage 20. The eyes and skin are fragile and easily damaged,and blood vessel involvement is a possibility. The bonesmay also be affected as demonstrated by a decrease inbone mass. Kyphoscoliosis type is inherited in an autoso-mal recessive manner.
There are four major clinical diagnostic criteria for"
"There are four major clinical diagnostic criteria for
EDS kyphoscoliosis type. These include generaly loosejoints, low muscle tone at birth, scoliosis at birth (whichworsens with age), and a fragility of the eyes, which maygive the white area of the eye a blue tint or cause the eyeto rupture. This form of EDS is caused by a change in thePLOD gene on chromosome 1, which encodes theenzyme lysyl hydroxylase. A laboratory test is availablein which urinary hydroxylysyl pryridinoline is measured.This test, performed on urine is extremely senstive andspecific for EDS kyphoscolios type. Laboratory testing isrecommended for infants with three or more of the majordiagnostic criteria.
Prenatal testing is available if a pregnancy is known
to be at risk and an identified affected family member hashad positive laboratory testing. An amniocentesis may
be performed in which fetal cells are removed from theamniotic fluid and enzyme activity is measured.
Arthrochalasia type"
"Arthrochalasia type
Dislocation of the hip joint typically accompanies
arthrochalasia type EDS, formerly called EDS type VIIB.Other joints are also unusually loose, leading to recurrentpartial and total dislocations. The skin has a high degreeof stretchability and bruises easily. Individuals with thistype of EDS may also experience mildly diminished
bone mass, scoliosis, and poor muscle tone. Arthrochala-sia type is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
There are two major clinical diagnostic criteria for
EDS arthrochalasia type. These include sever general-ized joing hypermobility and bilateral hip dislocationpresent at birth. This form of EDS is caused by a changein either of two components of Collage type I, calledproa1(I) type A and proa2(I) type B. A skin biopsy maybe preformed to demonstrate an abnormality in eithercomponents. Direct DNA testing is also available.

"Dermatosparaxis type
Individuals with this type of EDS, once called type
VIIC, have extremely fragile skin that bruises easily butdoes not scar excessively. The skin is soft and may sag,leading to an aged appearance even in young adults. Indi-viduals may also experience hernias. Dermatosparaxistype is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
There are two major clinical diagnostic criteria for
EDS dematosparaxis type. These include severe skinfragility and sagging or aged appearing skin. This form ofEDS is caused by a change in the enzyme called procolla-gen I N-terminal peptidase. A skin biopsy may be pre-formed for a definitive diagnosis of Dermatosparaxis type.

"Causes and symptoms
There are numerous types of EDS, all caused by
changes in one of several genes. The manner in which EDSis inherited depends on the specific gene involved. Thereare three patterns of inheritance for EDS: autosomal domi-nant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked (extremely rare).
Chromosomes are made up of hundreds of small
units known as genes, which contain the genetic materialnecessary for an individual to develop and function.Humans have 46 chromosomes, which are matched into23 pairs. Because chromosomes are inherited in pairs,each individual receives two copies of each chromosomeand likewise two copies of each gene.

Diagnosis

and unusual skin qualities, along with family history, can

"lead to a diagnosis of EDS. Specific tests, such as skin
biopsies are available for diagnosis of certain types ofEDS, including vascular, arthrochalasia, and der-matosparaxis types. A skin biopsy involves removing asmall sample of skin and examining its microscopic struc-ture. A urine test is available for the Kyphoscoliosis type.
Management of all types of EDS may include genet-
ic counseling to help the affected individual and theirfamily understand the disorder and its impact on otherfamily members and future children.
If a couple has had a child diagnosed with EDS the
chance that they will have another child with the samedisorder depends on with what form of EDS the child hasbeen diagnosed and if either parent is affected by thesame disease or not.
Individuals diagnosed with an autosomal dominant"
"Individuals diagnosed with an autosomal dominant
form of EDS have a 50% chance of passing the same disor-der on to a child in each pregnancy. Individuals diagnosedwith an autosomal recessive form of EDS have an extreme-ly low risk of having a child with the same disorder.
X-linked recessive EDS is accompanied by a slight-
ly more complicated pattern of inheritance. If a fatherwith an X-linked recessive form of EDS passes a copy ofhis X chromosome to his children, the sons will be unaf-fected and the daughters will be carriers. If a mother is acarrier for an X-linked recessive form of EDS, she mayhave affected or unaffected sons, or carrier or unaffecteddaughters, depending on the second sex chromosomeinherited from the father.
Prenatal diagnosis is available for specific forms of
EDS, including kyphosocliosis type and vascular type.However, prenatal testing is only a possibility in thesetypes if the underlying defect has been found in anotherfamily member.
Treatment"
"Treatment
Medical therapy relies on managing symptoms and
trying to prevent further complications. There is no curefor EDS.
Braces may be prescribed to stabilize joints, although
surgery is sometimes necessary to repair joint damagecaused by repeated dislocations. Physical therapy teachesindividuals how to strengthen muscles around joints andmay help to prevent or limit damage. Elective surgery isdiscouraged due to the high possibility of complications.
Alternative treatment
There are anecdotal reports that large daily doses

"health in persons with a diagnosis of EDS. An individualwith EDS should discuss these types of therapies withtheir doctor before beginning them on their own. Thera-py that does not require medical consultation involvesprotecting the skin with sunscreen and avoiding activitiesthat place stress on the joints.
Prognosis
The outlook for individuals with EDS depends on
the type of EDS with which they have been diagnosed.Symptoms vary in severity, even within one sub-type,and the frequency of complications changes on an indi-vidual basis. Some individuals have negligible symptomswhile others are severely restricted in their daily life.Extreme joint instability and scoliosis may limit a per-son’s mobility. Most individuals will have a normal lifes-pan. However, those with blood vessel involvement, par-ticularly those with EDS vascular type, have an increasedrisk of fatal complications.
EDS is a lifelong condition. Affected individuals"
"EDS is a lifelong condition. Affected individuals
may face social obstacles related to their disease on adaily basis. Some people with EDS have reported livingwith fears of significant and painful skin ruptures,becoming pregnant (especially those with EDS vasculartype), their condition worsening, becoming unemployeddue to physical and emotional burdens, and socialstigmatization in general.
Constant bruises, skin wounds , and trips to the hos-
pital take their toll on both affected children and theirparents. Prior to diagnosis parents of children with EDShave found themselves under suspicion of child abuse .
Some people with EDS are not diagnosed until well
into adulthood and, in the case of EDS vascular type,occasionally not until after death due to complications ofthe disorder. Not only may the diagnosis itself be devas-tating to the family, but in many cases other family mem-bers find out for the first time they are at risk for beingaffected."
"Although individuals with EDS face significant
challenges, it is important to remember that each personis unique with their own distinguished qualities andpotential. Persons with EDS go on to have families, tohave careers, and to be accomplished citizens, surmount-ing the challenges of their disease.

Ehrlichiosis
Definition
Ehrlichiosis is a bacterial infection that is spread by
ticks. Symptoms include fever , chills, headache , muscle
aches, and tiredness.

tion with Ehrlichia bacteria. Ticks are small, blood-suck-"
"tion with Ehrlichia bacteria. Ticks are small, blood-suck-
ing arachnids. Although some ticks carry disease-causingorganisms, most do not. When an animal or person is bit-ten by a tick that carries bacteria, the bacteria are passedto that person or animal during the tick’s feeding process.It is believed that the tick must remain attached to theperson or animal for at least 24 hours to spread the infec-tion.
There are two forms of ehrlichiosis in the United
States; human monocytic ehrlichiosis and human gran-ulocytic ehrlichiosis. Monocytic ehrlichiosis is causedby Ehrlichia chaffeensis , which is spread by the Lone
Star tick, Amblyomma americanum . As of early 1998,
about 400 cases of monocytic ehrlichiosis had beenreported in 30 states, primarily in the southeastern andsouth central United States. The bacteria that causesgranulocytic ehrlichiosis is not known, but suspected tobe either Ehrlichia equi or Ehrlichia phagocytophila ."
"Granulocytic ehrlichiosis is probably spread by theblacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis (which also spreads
Lyme disease ). About 100 cases of granulocytic ehrli-
chiosis have been reported in Connecticut, Massachu-setts, Rhode Island, Minnesota, New York, and Wiscon-sin.
Causes and symptoms
Both forms of ehrlichiosis have similar symptoms,
and the illnesses can range from mild to severe and life-threatening. Risk factors include old age and exposure toticks through work or recreation. Symptoms occur sevento 21 days following a tick bite although patients may notrecall being bitten. Fever, tiredness, headache, muscleaches, chills, loss of appetite, confusion, nausea, andvomiting are common to both diseases. A rash mayoccur.

"Diagnosis
Ehrlichiosis may be diagnosed and treated by doc-
tors who specialize in blood diseases (hematologists) oran infectious disease specialist. Because ehrlichiosis isnot very common and the symptoms are not unique, itmay be misdiagnosed. A recent history of a tick bite ishelpful in the diagnosis. Blood tests will be done to lookfor antibodies to Ehrlichia . Staining and microscopic
examination of the blood sample may show Ehrlichia
bacteria inside white blood cells. Another test, calledpolymerase chain reaction (PCR), is a very sensitiveassay to detect bacteria in the blood sample, but it is notalways available.
Treatment
Antibiotic treatment should begin immediately if
ehrlichiosis is suspected, even if laboratory results arenot available. Treatment with either tetracycline(Sumycin, Achromycin V) or doxycycline (Monodox,Vibramycin) is recommended. Many patients with ehrli-chiosis are admitted to the hospital for treatment.
Prognosis"
"Prognosis
For otherwise healthy people, a full recovery is
expected following treatment for ehrlichiosis. Elderlypatients are at a higher risk for severe disease, which maybe fatal. Serious complications include lung or gastroin-testinal bleeding. Two to 10 patients out of 100 die fromthe disease.
Prevention
The only prevention for ehrlichiosis is to minimize
exposure to ticks by staying on the trail when walkingthrough the woods, avoiding tall grasses, wearing longsleeves and tucking pant legs into socks, wearing insect

a tick as soon as possible by grasping the tick withtweezers and gently pulling.

Electric shock injuries
Definition
Electric shock injuries are caused by lightning or
electric current from a mechanical source passingthrough the body.
Description
Electric shocks are responsible for about 1,000
deaths in the United States each year, or about 1% of allaccidental deaths.
Causes and symptoms

"Causes and symptoms
The severity of injury depends on the current’s pres-
sure (voltage), the amount of current (amperage), thetype of current (direct vs. alternating), the body’s resis-tance to the current, the current’s path through the body,and how long the body remains in contact with the cur-rent. The interplay of these factors can produce effectsranging from barely noticeable tingling to instant death ;
every part of the body is vulnerable. Although the severi-KEY TERMS
Tick-borne disease —A disease that is spread to
animals by the bite of an infected tick.ty of injury is determined primarily by the voltage, low
voltage can be just as dangerous as high voltage underthe right circumstances. People have been killed byshocks of just 50 volts.
How electric shocks affect the skin is determined by"
"How electric shocks affect the skin is determined by
the skin’s resistance, which in turn is dependent upon thewetness, thickness, and cleanliness of the skin. Thin or wetskin is much less resistant than thick or dry skin. Whenskin resistance is low, the current may cause little or noskin damage but severely burn internal organs and tissues.Conversely, high skin resistance can produce severe skinburns but prevent the current from entering the body.
The nervous system (the brain, spinal cord, and
nerves) is particularly vulnerable to injury. In fact, neuro-logical problems are the most common kind of nonlethalharm suffered by electric shock victims. Some neurologicaldamage is minor and clears up on its own or with medicaltreatment, but some is severe and permanent. Neurologicalproblems may be apparent immediately after the accident,or gradually develop over a period of up to three years.
Damage to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems"
"Damage to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems
is most acute at the moment of injury. Electric shocks canparalyze the respiratory system or disrupt heart action,causing instant death. Also at risk are the smaller veins andarteries, which dissipate heat less easily than the largerblood vessels and can develop blood clots. Damage to thesmaller vessels is probably one reason why amputation is
often required following high-voltage injuries.
Many other sorts of injuries are possible after an
electric shock, including cataracts , kidney failure, and
substantial destruction of muscle tissue. The victim maysuffer a fall or be hit by debris from exploding equip-ment. An electric arc may set clothing or nearby flamma-ble substances on fire. Strong shocks are often accompa-nied by violent muscle spasms that can break and dislo-cate bones. These spasms can also freeze the victim inplace and prevent him or her from breaking away fromthe source of the current.
Diagnosis"
"Diagnosis
Diagnosis relies on gathering information about the
circumstances of the accident, a thorough physical exami-
nation , and monitoring of cardiovascular and kidney activ-
ity. The victim’s neurological condition can fluctuate rapid-ly and requires close observation. A computed tomographyscan (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
may be necessary to check for brain injury.
Treatment
When an electric shock accident happens at home or
in the workplace, the main power should immediately be

"shut off. If that cannot be done, and current is still flowing
through the victim, the alternative is to stand on a dry, non-conducting surface such as a folded newspaper, flattenedcardboard carton, or plastic or rubber mat and use a non-conducting object such as a wooden broomstick (never adamp or metallic object) to push the victim away from thesource of the current. The victim and the source of the cur-rent must not be touched while the current is still flowing,for this can electrocute the rescuer. Emergency medicalhelp should be summoned as quickly as possible. Peoplewho are trained to perform cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion (CPR ) should, if appropriate, begin first aid while
waiting for emergency medical help to arrive.
Burn victims usually require treatment at a burn cen-
ter. Fluid replacement therapy is necessary to restore lostfluids and electrolytes. Severely injured tissue is repairedsurgically, which can involve skin grafting or amputa-"
"tion. Antibiotics and antibacterial creams are used to
prevent infection. Victims may also require treatment forkidney failure. Following surgery, physical therapy tofacilitate recovery, and psychological counseling to copewith disfigurement, may be necessary.
Prognosis
Electric shocks cause death in 3–15% of cases. Many
survivors require amputation or are disfigured by theirburns. Injuries from household appliances and other low-voltage sources are less likely to produce extreme damage.KEY TERMS

Electrical nerve stimulation
Definition
Electrical nerve stimulation, also called transcuta-
neous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), is a noninva-sive, drug-free pain management technique. By sending"
"electrical signals to underlying nerves, the battery-pow-ered TENS device can relieve a wide range of chronicand acute pain .
Purpose
TENS is used to relieve pain caused by a variety of
chronic conditions, including:
• neck and lower back pain
• headache/migraine• arthritis• post-herpetic neuralgia (lingering chronic pain after an
attack of shingles )
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1144Electrical nerve stimulationGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1144"
"• sciatica (pain radiating from lower back, through the
legs, to the foot)
• temporomandibular joint pain• osteoarthritis• amputation (phantom limb)• fibromyalgia (a condition causing aching and stiffness
throughout the body)
The device is also effective against short-term pain,
such as:
• shingles (painful skin eruptions along the nerves)
• bursitis (inflammation of tissue surrounding a joint)• childbirth
• post-surgical pain
• fractures• muscle and joint pain• sports injuries• menstrual cramps
Precautions
Because TENS may interfere with pacemaker func-
tion, patients with pacemakers should consult a cardiol-
ogist before using a TENS unit. Patients should alsoavoid electrical stimulation in the front of the neck,which can be hazardous. The safety of the device duringpregnancy has not been established.
TENS doesn’t cure any condition; it simply eases
pain. Patients who are not sure what is causing their painshould consult a physician before using TENS.
Description"
"Description
The TENS device is a small battery-powered stimu-
lator that produces low-intensity electrical signals throughelectrodes on or near a painful area, producing a tinglingsensation that reduces pain. There is no dosage limitation,and the patient controls the amount of pain relief.
Some experts believe TENS works by blocking pain
signals in the spinal cord, or by delivering electricalimpulses to underlying nerve fibers that lessen the expe-rience of pain. Others suspect that the electrical stimula-tion triggers the release of natural painkillers in the body.
Patients can rent a TENS unit before buying one, to
see if it is effective against their pain.
Preparation
After TENS has been prescribed, a doctor will refer
the patient to a TENS specialist, who will explain how touse the machine. The specialist works with the patient todetermine the settings and electrode placements for thebest pain relief.KEY TERMS

"Fibromyalgia —A condition characterized by

Temporomandibular joint pain (TMJ) —Pain and
other symptoms affecting the head, jaw, and facethat are caused when the jaw joints and musclescontrolling them don’t work together correctly.
Risks
TENS is nonaddictive and completely safe. The only
side effect may be a slight skin irritation or redness insome people, which can be prevented by using differentgels or electrodes.

"Normal results
The amount of relief a person gets using TENS
depends on the underlying cause of the pain, a person’smental state, and whether or not medication is also used.At least one study found that both a real TENS machineand a placebo were equally effective in reducing pain.This suggests that at least part of its effectiveness may bedue to the patient’s belief in its ability to ease pain.

"tremors associated with Parkinson disease . ESB is
administered by passing an electrical current through anelectrode implanted in the brain.
Purpose
While the implantation of electrodes in the brain is
used to treat or diagnose several disorders, the term ESBis limited here to the treatment of tremors, and as a pain
management tool for patients suffering from back prob-
lems and other chronic injuries and illnesses.
Precautions
An ESB tremor control device, used in treating
Parkinson patients, may interfere with or be affected bycardiac pacemakers and other medical equipment. As a
result, patients with other implanted medical equipmentmay not be good candidates for the therapy.
Description

"Description
Electrical stimulation of the brain, or deep brain
stimulation, is effective in treating tremors in up to 88%of Parkinson disease patients. An electrode is implantedinto the thalamus (part of the brain) of the patient, andattached to an electric pulse generator via an extensionwire. The pulse generator is implanted into the patient’spectoral, or chest area, and the extension wire is tunneledunder the skin. The pulse generator sends out intermit-tent electrical stimulation to the electrode in the thala-mus, which inhibits or partially relieves the tremor. Thegenerator can be turned on and off with a magnet, andneeds to be replaced every three to five years.

"Aftercare
After neurosurgery, patients should undergo regular
head dressing changes, minimize exposure to others, andpractice good personal hygiene in order to prevent abrain infection. The head may also be kept elevated for aprescribed period of time in order to decrease swelling ofthe brain.
Risks
The implantation of electrodes into the brain carries
risks of hemorrhage, infarction, infection, and cerebraledema . These complications could cause irreversible
neurological damage.
Patients with an implanted ESB tremor control
device may experience headaches, disequilibrium (a dis-turbance of the sense of balance), burning or tingling ofthe skin, or partial paralysis .
Normal results
ESB is effective in pain control for specific condi-
tions. It can provide long-term pain relief with few sideeffects or complications.
For the control of tremors a deep brain stimulator
does provide some relief. It is recommended for patientswith tremors severe enough to affect their quality of life."

Electrocardiography
Definition
Electrocardiography is a commonly used, non-inva-
sive procedure for recording electrical changes in theheart. The record, which is called an electrocardiogram(ECG or EKG), shows the series of waves that relate tothe electrical impulses which occur during each beat ofthe heart. The results are printed on paper or displayedon a monitor. The waves in a normal record are named P,Q, R, S, and T and follow in alphabetical order. The num-ber of waves may vary, and other waves may be present.

"Purpose
Electrocardiography is a starting point for detecting
many cardiac problems. It is used routinely in physicalexaminations and for monitoring the patient’s conditionduring and after surgery, as well as during intensive care.It is the basic measurement used for tests such as exercise
tolerance. It is used to evaluate causes of symptoms suchas chest pain,shortness of breath , and palpitations .Precautions
No special precautions are required.
Description
The patient disrobes from the waist up, and elec-
trodes (tiny wires in adhesive pads) are applied to specif-ic sites on the arms, legs, and chest. When attached, theelectrodes are called leads; three to 12 leads may beemployed.
Muscle movement may interfere with the recording,
which lasts for several beats of the heart. In cases whererhythm disturbances are suspected to be infrequent, thepatient may wear a small Holter monitor in order torecord continuously over a 24-hour period; this is knownas ambulatory monitoring.
Preparation"
"Preparation
The skin is cleaned to obtain good electrical contact
at the electrode positions.
Aftercare
To avoid skin irritation from the salty gel used to
obtain good electrical contact, the skin should be thor-oughly cleaned after removal of the electrodes.
Risks

impulses travel through specialized cells that form a con-duction system. Following this pathway ensures that con-tractions will occur in a coordinated manner.
When the presence of all waves is observed in the
electrocardiogram and these waves follow the orderdefined alphabetically, the heart is said to show a normalsinus rhythm, and impulses may be assumed to be fol-lowing the regular conduction pathway.

"In the normal heart, electrical impulses—at a rate of

Aftertraveling down to the junction between the upper andlower chambers, the signal stimulates the atrioventricularnode. From here, after a delay, it passes by specializedroutes through the lower chambers or ventricles. In manydisease states, the passage of the electrical impulse canbe interrupted in a variety of ways, causing the heart toperform less efficiently.

"Abnormal results
Special training is required for interpretation of the
electrocardiogram. To summarize the features used in inter-pretations in the simplest manner, the P wave of the electro-cardiogram is associated with the contraction of the atria.The QRS series of waves, or QRS complex, is associatedwith ventricular contraction, with the T wave coming afterthe contraction. Finally, the P-Q or P-R interval gives avalue for the time taken for the electrical impulse to travelfrom the atria to the ventricle (normally less than 0.2 sec).The cause of dysrhythmia is ectopic beats. Ectopic"
"beats are premature heart beats that arise from a siteother than the sinus node—commonly from the atria,atrioventricular node, or the ventricle. When these dys-rhythmias are only occasional, they may produce nosymptoms, or a feeling of the heart turning over or “flip-flopping” may be experienced. These occasional dys-rhythmias are common in healthy people, but they alsocan be an indication of heart disease.
The varied sources of dysrhythmias provide a wide
range of alterations in the form of the electrocardiogram.Ectopic beats that start in the ventricle display an abnor-mal QRS complex. This can indicate disease associatedwith insufficient blood supply to the muscle (myocardialischemia ). Multiple ectopic sites lead to rapid and unco-
ordinated contractions of the atria or ventricles. This con-dition is known as fibrillation. In atrial fibrillation, Pwaves are absent, and the QRS complex appears at errat-ic intervals, or “irregularly irregular.”"
"When the atrial impulse fails to reach the ventricle, a
condition known as heart block results. If this is partial,
the P-R interval (the time for the impulse to reach the ven-tricle) is prolonged. If complete, the ventricles beat inde-pendently of the atria at about 40 beats per minute, andthe QRS complex is mostly dissociated from the P wave.

"Electroconvulsive therapy
Definition
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a medical treat-
ment for severe mental illness in which a small, carefullycontrolled amount of electricity is introduced into thebrain. This electrical stimulation, used in conjunction withanesthesia and muscle relaxant medications, produces amild generalized seizure or convulsion. While used to treata variety of psychiatric disorders, it is most effective in thetreatment of severe depression, and provides the mostrapid relief currently available for this illness.
Purpose
The purpose of electroconvulsive therapy is to provide
relief from the signs and symptoms of mental illnessessuch as severe depression, mania , and schizophrenia ."
"ECT is indicated when patients need rapid improvementbecause they are suicidal, self-injurious, refuse to eat ordrink, cannot or will not take medication as prescribed, orpresent some other danger to themselves. Antidepressantmedications, while effective in many cases, may take twoto six weeks to produce a therapeutic effect. Antipsychoticmedications used to treat mania and schizophrenia havemany uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous sideeffects, limiting their use. In addition, some patients devel-op allergies and therefore are unable to take their medicine.
Precautions
The most common risks associated with ECT are
disturbances in heart rhythm. Broken or dislocated bonesoccur very rarely.Description

"The treatment of severe mental illness, such as
schizophrenia, using electroconvulsive therapy wasintroduced in 1938 by two Italian doctors named Cerlettiand Bini. In those days many doctors believed that con-vulsions were incompatible with schizophrenia since,according to their obervations, this disease rarelyoccurred in individuals suffering from epilepsy. Theyconcluded, therefore, that if convulsions could be artifi-cally produced in patients with schizophrenia, the illnesscould be cured. Some doctors were already using a vari-ety of chemicals to produce seizures, but many of theirpatients died or suffered severe injuries because thestrength of the convulsions could not be well controlled.

versial of all procedures used to treat mental illness.When it was first introduced, many people were fright-ened simply because it was called “shock treatment.”Many assumed the procedure would be painful, othersthought it was a form of electrocution, and still othersbelieved it would cause brain damage. Unfortunately,unfavorable publicity in newspapers, magazines, andmovies added to these fears.
Indeed, in those early years, patients and families
were rarely educated by doctors and nurses regarding thisor other forms of psychiatric treatment. In addition, noanesthesia or muscle relaxants were used. As a result,
patients had violent seizures, and even though they didnot remember them, the procedure itself was frightening.

"The way these treatments are given today is very dif-
ferent from the procedures used in the past. Currently,ECT is offered on both an inpatient and outpatient basis.Hospitals have specially equipped rooms with oxygen,suction, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR ) in
order to deal with the rare emergency.
The treatment is carried out as follows: approxi-
mately 30 minutes before the scheduled treatment time,the patient may receive an injection of a medication(such as atropine) that keeps the pulse rate from decreas-ing too much during the convulsion. Next, the patient isplaced on a cot and hooked up to a machine that automat-ically takes and displays vital signs (temperature, pulse,respiration, and blood pressure) on a television-like mon-itor. A mild anesthetic is then injected into a vein, fol-lowed by a medication (such a Anectine) that relaxes allof the muscles in the body so that the seizure is mild, andthe risk of broken bones is virtually eliminated."
"When the patient is both relaxed and asleep, an air-
way is placed in the mouth to aid with breathing. Elec-trodes are placed on the sides of the head in the templeareas. An electric current is passed through the brain bymeans of a machine specifically designed for this pur-

"0.1–0.5 seconds. In the first stage of the seizure (tonicphase), the muscles in the body that have not been para-lyzed by medication contract for a period of five to 15seconds. This is followed by the second stage (clonicphase) that is characterized by twitching movements,usually visible only in the toes or in a non-paralyzed armor leg. These are caused by alternating contraction andrelaxation of these same muscles. This stage lastsapproximately 10–60 seconds. The entire procedure,from beginning to end, lasts about 30 minutes.
The total number of treatments a patient will receive

"The electrodes may be placed on both sides of the
head (bilateral) or one side (unilateral). While bilateralECT appears to be somewhat more effective, unilateralECT is preferred for individuals who experience pro-longed confusion or forgetfulness following treatment.Many doctors begin treatment with unilateral ECT, thenchange to bilateral if the patient is not improving.
Post-treatment confusion and forgetfulness are com-
mon, though disturbing symptoms associated with ECT.Doctors and nurses must be patient and supportive byproviding patients with factual information about recov-ery. Elderly patients, for example, may become increas-ingly confused and forgetful as the treatments continue.These symptoms usually subside with time, but a smallminority of patients state that they have never fullyrecovered from these effects.

"With the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950s, the
use of ECT became less frequent. These new medicationsprovided relief for untold thousands of patients who sufferedgreatly from their illness. However, there are a number ofside effects associated with these drugs, some of which areirreversible. Another drawback is that some medications donot produce a therapeutic effect for two to six weeks. Duringthis time the patient may present a danger to himself or oth-ers. In addition, there are patients who do not respond tomedicine or who have severe allergic reactions. For theseindividuals, ECT may be the only treatment that will help.

"Preparation
Patients and relatives are prepared for ECT by being
shown video tapes that explain both the procedure and therisks involved. The physician then answers any questionsthese individuals may have, and the patient is asked tosign an “Informed Consent Form.” This gives the doctorand the hospital permission to administer the treatment.Once the form is signed, the doctor performs a com-
plete physical examination , and orders a number of
tests that can help identify any potential problem. Thesetests may include a chest x ray , an electrocardiogram
(ECG), urinalysis , spinal x ray, brain wave (EEG), and
complete blood count (CBC).
Some medications, such as lithium and a type of anti-
depressant known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors ,
should be discontinued for some time before treatment.Patients are instructed not to eat or drink for at least eighthours prior to the procedure in order to reduce the possi-bility of vomiting and choking .
Aftercare"
"Aftercare
After the treatment, patients are moved to a recovery
area. Vital signs are recorded every five minutes until thepatient is fully awake, which may take 15–30 minutes.Some initial confusion may be present but usually disap-pears in a matter of minutes. There may be complaints ofheadache , muscle pain , or back pain. Such discomfort is
quickly relieved by mild medications such as aspirin .
Risks
Advanced medical technology has substantially
reduced the complications associated with ECT. Theseinclude slow heart beat (bradycardia), rapid heart beat(tachycardia), memory loss, and confusion. Persons athigh risk for ECT include those with recent heart
attack , uncontrolled blood pressure, brain tumors, and
previous spinal injuries.
Normal results
ECT often produces dramatic improvement in the
signs and symptoms of major depression, especially in

"elderly individuals, sometimes during the first week of
treatment. While it is estimated that 50% of thesepatients will experience a future return of symptoms, theprognosis for each episode of illness is good. Mania alsooften responds well to treatment. The picture is not asbright for schizophrenia, which is more difficult to treatand is characterized by frequent relapses.
A few patients are placed on maintenance ECT. This
means they return to the hospital every one to twomonths, as needed, for an additional treatment. Theseindividuals are thus able to keep their illness under con-trol and lead a normal and productive life.

Electroencephalography
Definition
Electroencephalography, or EEG, is a neurological
test that uses an electronic monitoring device to measureand record electrical activity in the brain.
Purpose
The EEG is a key tool in the diagnosis and manage-
ment of epilepsy and other seizure disorders. It is also usedto assist in the diagnosis of brain damage and disease (e.g.,stroke , tumors, encephalitis ),mental retardation ,sleep
disorders , degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s dis-
ease and Parkinson’s disease , and certain mental disor-"
"ease and Parkinson’s disease , and certain mental disor-
ders (e.g., alcoholism ,schizophrenia ,autism ).An EEG may also be used to monitor brain activity
during surgery and to determine brain death .
Precautions
Electroencephalography should be administered and
interpreted by a trained medical professional only. Datafrom an EEG is only one element of a complete medicaland/or psychological patient assessment, and shouldnever be used alone as the sole basis for a diagnosis.

"Description
Before the EEG begins, a nurse or technician attach-
es approximately 16–20 electrodes to the patient’s scalpwith a conductive, washable paste. Depending on thepurpose for the EEG, implantable or invasive electrodesare occasionally used. Implantable electrodes includesphenoidal electrodes, which are fine wires insertedunder the zygomatic arch, or cheekbone; and depth elec-trodes, which are surgically-implanted into the brain.The EEG electrodes are painless, and are used to mea-sure the electrical activity in various regions of the brain.
For the test, the patient lies on a bed, padded table,"
"For the test, the patient lies on a bed, padded table,
or comfortable chair and is asked to relax and remain stillduring the EEG testing period. An EEG usually takes nomore than one hour. During the test procedure, thepatient may be asked to breathe slowly or quickly; visualstimuli such as flashing lights or a patterned board maybe used to stimulate certain types of brain activity.Throughout the procedure, the electroencephalographmachine makes a continuous graphic record of thepatient’s brain activity, or brainwaves, on a long strip ofrecording paper or on a computer screen. This graphicrecord is called an electroencephalogram.
The sleep EEG uses the same equipment and proce-
dures as a regular EEG. Patients undergoing a sleep EEGare encouraged to fall asleep completely rather than justrelax. They are typically provided a bed and a quiet roomconducive to sleep. A sleep EEG lasts up to three hours.

"In an ambulatory EEG, patients are hooked up to a
portable cassette recorder. They then go about their nor-mal activities, and take their normal rest and sleep for aperiod of up to 24 hours. During this period, the patientand patient’s family record any symptoms or abnormalbehaviors, which can later be correlated with the EEG tosee if they represent seizures.
Many insurance plans provide reimbursement for
EEG testing. Costs for an EEG range from $100 to morethan $500, depending on the purpose and type of test(i.e., asleep or awake, and invasive or non-invasive elec-trodes). Because coverage may be dependent on the dis-

"order or illness the EEG is evaluating, patients should
check with their individual insurance plan.
Preparation
Full instructions should be given to EEG patients
when they schedule their test. Typically, individuals onmedications that affect the central nervous system, suchas anticonvulsants, stimulants, or antidepressants, aretold to discontinue their prescription for a short timeprior to the test (usually one to two days). Patients maybe asked to avoid food and beverages that contain caf-
feine , a central nervous system stimulant. However, any
such request should be cleared by the treating physician.Patients may also be asked to arrive for the test withclean hair free of spray or other styling products.
Patients undergoing a sleep EEG may be asked to
remain awake the night before their test. They may begiven a sedative prior to the test to induce sleep.

"Aftercare
If the patient has suspended regular medication for
the test, the EEG nurse or technician should advise himwhen he can begin taking it again.Risks
Being off medication for one to two days may trigger
seizures. Certain procedures used during EEG may trig-ger seizures in patients with epilepsy. Those proceduresinclude flashing lights and deep breathing. If the EEG isbeing used as a diagnostic for epilepsy (i.e., to determinethe type of seizures an individual is suffering from), thismay be a desired effect, although the patient needs to bemonitored closely so that the seizure can be aborted ifnecessary.

In reading and interpreting brainwave patterns, a
neurologist or other physician will evaluate the type ofbrainwaves and the symmetry, location, and consistencyof brainwave patterns. He will also look at the brain-wave response to certain stimuli presented during theEEG test (such as flashing lights or noise). There arefour basic types of brainwaves: alpha, beta, theta, anddelta. “Normal” brainwave patterns vary widely,depending on factors of age and activity. For example,awake and relaxed individuals typically register an alphawave pattern of eight to 13 cycles per second. Young

"children and sleeping adults may have a delta wave pat-
tern of under four cycles per second.
Abnormal results
The EEG readings of patients with epilepsy or other
seizure disorders display bursts or spikes of electrical activ-ity. In focal epilepsy, spikes are restricted to one hemi-sphere of the brain. If spikes are generalized to both hemi-spheres of the brain, multifocal epilepsy may be present.
The diagnostic brainwave patterns of other disorders
varies widely. The appearance of excess theta waves(four to eight cycles per second) may indicate braininjury. Brain wave patterns in patients with brain disease,mental retardation, and brain injury show overall slow-ing. A trained medical specialist should interpret EEGresults in the context of the patient’s medical history, andother pertinent medical test results.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is performed by a physician or other quali-
fied healthcare provider who will take a medical history,discuss symptoms, perform a complete physical exami-
nation , and prescribe appropriate laboratory tests.
Because electrolyte disorders commonly affect the neuro-muscular system, the provider will test reflexes. If a calci-um imbalance is suspected, the physician will also checkfor Chvostek’s sign, a reflex test that triggers an involun-tary facial twitch, and Trousseau’s sign, a muscle spasmthat occurs in response to pressure on the upper arm.
Serum electrolyte imbalances can be detected
through blood tests. Blood is drawn from a vein on theback of the hand or inside of the elbow by a medicaltechnician, or phlebotomist, and analyzed at a lab.
Normal levels of electrolytes are:

"Electrolyte tests
Definition
Electrolytes are positively and negatively charged
molecules, called ions, that are found within cells,between cells, in the bloodstream, and in other fluidsthroughout the body. Electrolytes with a positive chargeinclude sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium; thenegative ions are chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphate.The concentrations of these ions in the bloodstreamremain fairly constant throughout the day in a healthyperson. Changes in the concentration of one or more ofthese ions can occur during various acute and chronicdisease states and can lead to serious consequences.
Purpose
Tests that measure the concentration of electrolytes
are useful in the emergency room and to obtain clues forthe diagnosis of specific diseases. Electrolyte tests areused for diagnosing dietary deficiencies, excess loss ofnutrients due to urination, vomiting, and diarrhea ,o r"
"abnormal shifts in the location of an electrolyte withinthe body. When an abnormal electrolyte value is detect-ed, the physician may either act to immediately correctthe imbalance directly (in the case of an emergency) orrun further tests to determine the underlying cause of theabnormal electrolyte value. Electrolyte disturbances canoccur with malfunctioning of the kidney (renal failure),infections that produce severe and continual diarrhea orvomiting, drugs that cause loss of electrolytes in theurine ( diuretics ),poisoning due to accidental consump-
tion of electrolytes, or diseases involving hormones thatregulate electrolyte concentrations.

"Precautions
Electrolyte tests are performed from routine blood
tests. The techniques are simple, automated, and fairlyuniform throughout the United States. During the prepa-ration of blood plasma or serum, health workers musttake care not to break the red blood cells, especiallywhen testing for serum potassium. Because the concen-tration of potassium within red blood cells is much high-er than in the surrounding plasma or serum, broken cellswould cause falsely elevated potassium levels.
Description
Electrolyte tests are typically conducted on blood"
"plasma or serum, urine, and diarrheal fluids. Electrolytescan be classified in at least five different ways. One wayis that some electrolytes tend to exist mostly inside cells,or are intracellular, while others tend to be outside cells,or are extracellular. Potassium, phosphate, and magne-sium occur at much greater levels inside the cell thanoutside, while sodium and chloride occur at much greaterlevels extracellularly. A second classification distinguish-es those electrolytes that participate directly in the trans-mission of nerve impulses and those that do not. Sodium,potassium, and calcium are the important electrolytesinvolved in nerve impulses, and disorders affecting themare most closely associated with neurological disorders.A third classification focuses on electrolytes that are ableto form a tight union, or complex, with one another. Cal-cium and phosphate have the greatest tendency to formcomplexes with each other. Disorders that cause anincrease in either plasma calcium or"
"to formcomplexes with each other. Disorders that cause anincrease in either plasma calcium or phosphate can resultin the deposit of calcium-phosphate crystals in the softtissues of the body. A fourth classification concerns thoseelectrolytes that influence the acidity or alkalinity of thebloodstream, also known as the pH. The pH of the blood-stream is normally in the range of 7.35–7.45. A decreasebelow this range is called acidosis, while a pH above thisrange is called alkalosis. The electrolytes most closelyassociated with the pH of the bloodstream are bicarbon-ate, chloride, and phosphate."
"Preparation
All electrolyte tests can be performed on plasma or
serum. Plasma is prepared by withdrawing a blood sam-ple and placing it in a test tube containing a chemical thatprevents blood from clotting (an anticoagulant). Serum isprepared by withdrawing a blood sample, placing it in atest tube, and allowing it to clot. The blood spontaneouslyclots within a minute of withdrawing the blood from avein. The serum or plasma is then rapidly spun with acentrifuge in order to remove the blood cells or clot.
Normal results
Electrolyte concentrations are similar whether mea-
sured in serum or plasma. Values can be expressed interms of weight per unit volume (mg/deciliter; mg/dL) orin the number of molecules in a volume, or molarity(moles or millimoles/liter; M or mM). The range of nor-mal values sometimes varies slightly between differentage groups, for males and females, and between differentanalytical laboratories.

"The normal level of serum sodium is in the range of
136–145 mM. The normal levels of serum potassium are3.5–5.0 mM. Note that sodium occurs at a much higherconcentration than potassium. The normal concentrationof total serum calcium (bound calcium plus free calcium)is in the range of 8.8–10.4 mg/dL. About 40% of the totalcalcium in the plasma is loosely bound to proteins; this

"calcium is referred to as bound calcium. The normal range
of free calcium is 4.8–5.2 mg/dL. The normal concentra-tion of serum magnesium is in the range of 2.0–3.0 mg/dL.
The normal concentration range of chloride is
350–375 mg/dL or 98–106 mM. The normal level ofphosphate, as expressed as the concentration of phospho-rus, is 2.0–4.3 mg/dL. Bicarbonate is an electrolyte thatis freely and spontaneously interconvertable with carbon-ic acid and carbon dioxide. The normal concentration ofcarbonic acid (H
2CO3) is about 1.35 mM. The normal
concentration of bicarbonate (HCO3/H11002) is about 27 mM.
The concentration of total carbon dioxide is the sum ofcarbonic acid and bicarbonate; this sum is normally inthe range of 26–28 mM. The ratio of bicarbonate/carbon-ic acid is more significant than the actual concentrationsof these two forms of carbon dioxide. Its normal value is27/1.35 (equivalent to 20/1).
Abnormal results

"Abnormal results
Positively charged electrolytes
High serum sodium levels ( hypernatremia ) occur at
sodium concentrations over 145 mM, with severe hyper-natremia over 152 mM. Hypernatremia is usually causedby diseases that cause excessive urination. In these cases,water is lost, but sodium is still retained in the body. Thesymptoms include confusion and can lead to convulsionsand coma . Low serum sodium levels ( hyponatremia ) are
below 130 mM, with severe hyponatremia at or below 125mM. Hyponatremia often occurs with severe diarrhea,with losses of both water and sodium, but with sodiumloss exceeding water loss. Hyponatremia provokes clinicalproblems only if serum sodium falls below 125 mM, espe-cially if this has occurred rapidly. The symptoms can be asmild as tiredness but may lead to convulsions and coma.
High serum potassium ( hyperkalemia ) occurs at"
"High serum potassium ( hyperkalemia ) occurs at
potassium levels above 5.0 mM; it is considered severeover 8.0 mM. Hyperkalemia is relatively uncommon, butsometimes occurs in patients with kidney failure who takepotassium supplements. Hyperkalemia can result in abnor-mal beating of the heart (cardiac arrhythmias ). Low
serum potassium ( hypokalemia ) occurs when serum
potassium falls below 3.0 mM. It can result from lowdietary potassium, as during starvation or in patients with
anorexia nervosa ; from excessive losses via the kidneys,
as caused by diuretic drugs; or by diseases of the adrenalor pituitary glands. Mild hypokalemia causes muscleweakness, while severe hypokalemia can cause paralysis ,
the inability to breathe, and cardiac arrhythmias.
High levels of calcium ions ( hypercalcemia ) occur
at free calcium ion concentrations over 5.2 mg/dL ortotal serum calcium above 10.4 mg/dL. Hypercalcemiausually occurs when the body dissolves bone at an abnor-"
"mally fast rate, increasing both serum calcium and serumphosphate. Sudden hypercalcemia can cause vomitingand coma, while prolonged and moderate hypercalcemiaresults in the deposit of calcium phosphate crystals in thekidneys and eye. Hypocalcemia occurs when serum free
calcium ions fall below 4.4 mg/dL, or when total serumcalcium falls below 8.8 mg/dL. Hypocalcemia can resultfrom hypoparathyroidism (low parathyroid hormone),
from failure to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, fromlow levels of plasma magnesium, and from phosphatepoisoning (the phosphate enters the bloodstream andforms a complex with the free serum calcium). Hypocal-cemia can cause depression and muscle spasms.
Hypermagnesemia occurs at serum magnesium lev-
els over 25 mM (60 mg/dL). Hypermagnesemia is rarebut can occur with the excessive consumption of magne-sium salts. Hypomagnesemia occurs when serum magne-sium levels fall below 0.8 mM, and can result from poornutrition . Chronic alcoholism is the most common"
"cause of hypomagnesemia, in part because of poor diet.Magnesium levels below 0.5 mM (1.2 mg/dL) causeserum calcium levels to decline. Some of the symptomsof hypomagnesemia, including twitching and convul-sions, actually result from the concurrent hypocalcemia.Hypomagnesemia can also result in hypokalemia andthereby cause cardiac arrhythmias.
Negatively charged electrolytes
Serum chloride levels sometimes increase to abnor-
mal levels as an undesirable side effect of medical treat-ment with sodium chloride or ammonium chloride. Thetoxicity of chloride results not from the chloride itself, butfrom the fact that the chloride occurs as the acid, hydro-gen chloride (more commonly known as hydrochloricacid, or HCl). An overdose of chloride may cause theaccumulation of hydrochloric acid in the bloodstream,with consequent acidosis. Renal tubular acidosis , one of"
"many kidney diseases, involves the failure to release acidinto the urine. The acidosis produces weakness,headache , nausea, and cardiac arrest. Low plasma chlo-
ride leads to the opposite situation: a decline in the acidcontent of the bloodstream. This is known as alkalizationof the bloodstream, or alkalosis. Hydrochloric acid, origi-nally from extracellular fluids, can be lost by vomiting. Atits most severe, alkalosis results in paralysis (tetany).
Hyperphosphatemia occurs at serum phosphate levels
above 5 mg/dL. It can result from the failure of the kidneysto excrete phosphate into the urine, causing phosphate toaccumulate in the bloodstream. Hyperphosphatemia canalso be caused by the impaired action of parathyroid hor-mone and by phosphate poisoning. Severe hyperphos-

"phatemia can cause paralysis, convulsions, and cardiac
arrest. These symptoms result because the phosphate,occurring in elevated levels, complexes with free serumcalcium, resulting in hypocalcemia. Tests for heart func-tion (an electrocardiogram) and parathyroid hormone lev-els are used in the diagnosis of hyperphosphatemia.Hypophosphatemia occurs if serum phosphorus falls to2.0 mg/dL or lower. It often results from a shift of inorgan-ic phosphate from the bloodstream to various organs andtissues. This shift can be caused by a rise in pH (alkaliza-tion) of the bloodstream, which can occur during hyper-ventilation, a reaction in various disease states. A shift inphosphate to intracellular tissues may draw calcium awayfrom the bloodstream via the formation of insoluble calci-um phosphate crystals within cells, with consequenthypocalcemia. Thus, tests for abnormalities in phosphatemetabolism also involve tests for serum calcium.
Bicarbonate metabolism involves several com-"
"Bicarbonate metabolism involves several com-
pounds. When dietary starches, sugars, and fats are bro-ken down for energy production, carbon dioxide is creat-ed. Much of this carbon dioxide (CO
2) spontaneously
converts to carbonic acid (H2CO3), and some of the car-
bonic acid spontaneously converts to bicarbonate(HCO
3/H11002) plus a hydrogen ion (H+). Eventually, almost
every molecule of carbon dioxide produced in the body,whether in the form of carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, orbicarbonate, must convert back to carbon dioxide inorder to leave via the lungs during normal breathing.
If one holds one’s breath, carbon dioxide cannot"
"escape from the lungs, but continues to be generated with-in the body. This results in an increase in production ofcarbonic acid. A portion of the carbonic acid breaks apart(dissociates), causing an increase in hydrogen ions in theplasma, with a resulting acidosis. Tests for serum bicar-bonate levels are accompanied by tests for acidosis (pHtest). Conversely, when one breathes too rapidly (hyper-ventilation), the carbon dioxide is drawn off from thebloodstream and expelled in the breath at an increasedrate. This results in an increase in the rate of combinationof bicarbonate with hydrogen ions, resulting in alkalosis.Acidosis and alkalosis can be produced by means otherthan by altering the rate of breathing. The carbonic acidand bicarbonate in the bloodstream minimize (or buffer)any trend to acidosis or alkalosis. Tests for bicarbonateare generally accompanied by tests for blood pH and pos-sibly tests for kidney malfunction, abnormal hormonefunction, or gastrointestinal disorders."

Electromyography (EMG) is an electrical recording

"Purpose
Muscles are stimulated by signals from nerve cells
called motor neurons. This stimulation causes electricalactivity in the muscle, which in turn causes contraction.This electrical activity is detected by a needle electrodeinserted into the muscle and connected to a recordingdevice. Together, the electrode and recorder are called anelectromyography machine. EMG can determine whethera particular muscle is responding appropriately to stimu-lation, and whether a muscle remains inactive when notstimulated.
EMG is performed most often to help diagnose dif-
ferent diseases causing weakness. Although EMG is atest of the motor system, it may help identify abnormali-ties of nerves or spinal nerve roots that may be associatedwith pain or numbness. Other symptoms for which EMG"
"may be useful include numbness, atrophy, stiffness, fas-ciculation, cramp, deformity, and spasticity. EMG resultscan help determine whether symptoms are due to a mus-cle disease or a neurological disorder, and, when com-bined with clinical findings, usually allow a confidentdiagnosis.
EMG can help diagnose many muscle and nerve dis-
orders, including:
• muscular dystrophy• congenital myopathies
• mitochondrial myopathies

• myotonias
• peripheral neuropathies
• radiculopathies• nerve lesions• amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
• polio
• spinal muscular atrophy• guillain-Barré syndrome
• ataxias
• myasthenias
Precautions
No special precautions are needed for this test.
Patients with a history of bleeding disorder should con-sult with their treating physician before the test. If a mus-cle biopsy is planned as part of the diagnostic work-up,EMG should not be performed at the same site, as it mayeffect the microscopic appearance of the muscle.

"Description
During an EMG test, a fine needle is inserted into
the muscle to be tested. This may cause some discomfort,similar to that of an injection. Recordings are made whilethe muscle is at rest, and then during the contraction. Theperson performing the test may move the limb being test-ed, and direct the patient to move it with various levels offorce. The needle may be repositioned in the same mus-cle for further recording. Other muscles may be tested aswell. A typical session lasts from 30–60 minutes.
A slightly different test, the nerve conduction veloci-
ty test , is often performed at the same time with the same
equipment. In this test, stimulating and recording elec-trodes are used, and small electrical shocks are applied tomeasure the ability of the nerve to conduct electrical sig-nals. This test may cause mild tingling and discomfortKEY TERMS

The interpretation of EMG results is not a simple
matter, requiring analysis of the onset, duration, ampli-tude, and other characteristics of the spike patterns.
Electrical activity at rest is abnormal; the particular
pattern of firing may indicate denervation (for example, anerve lesion, radiculopathy, or lower motor neurondegeneration), myotonia, or inflammatory myopathy.
Decreases in the amplitude and duration of spikes
are associated with muscle diseases, which also showfaster recruitment of other muscle fibers to compensatefor weakness. Recruitment is reduced in nerve disorders.

Electronic fetal monitoring
Definition
Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is a method for
examining the condition of a baby in the uterus by notingany unusual changes in its heart rate. Electronic fetal moni-toring is performed late in pregnancy or continuously dur-
ing labor to ensure normal delivery of a healthy baby. EFMcan be utilized either externally or internally in the womb.

"Purpose
The heart rate of a fetus undergoes constant adjust-
ment as it responds to its environment and other stimuli.The fetal monitor records an unborn baby’s heart rate andgraphs it on a piece of paper. Electronic fetal monitoringis usually advised for high-risk pregnancies, when thebaby is in danger of distress. Specific reasons for EFMinclude: babies in a breech position, premature labor ,
and induced labor, among others.
When electronic fetal monitoring was originally
introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, the hope was that itwould help physicians diagnose fetal hypoxia, or lack ofoxygen, in time to prevent damage to the baby. This lackof oxygen, also known as perinatal asphyxia or birthasphyxia, is an important cause of stillbirth and newborn"
"deaths. It occurs when there are less than normalamounts of oxygen delivered to the body or an organ andthere is build-up of carbon dioxide in the body or tissue.A lack of blood flow to an organ can cause asphyxia.Perinatal asphyxia can occur a long time before birth,shortly before birth, during delivery, or after birth. If theinterruption to the supply of oxygen is short, the babymay recover without any damage. If the time is longer,there may be some injury that is reversible. If the timeperiod without oxygen is very long, there may be perma-nent injury to one or more organs of the body. It is impor-tant, to detect any signs of asphyxia as soon as possible.One of the signs is an abnormal heart rate and rhythm inthe unborn baby, which can be detected by electronicfetal monitoring.

"The fetal monitor is a more intricate version of the
machine that a health care provider uses to listen to a baby’sheartbeat. The monitor that is used during prenatal visits justpicks up the sound of the baby’s heart beating. The fetalmonitor also keeps a continuous paper record of the heartrate. In addition, the fetal monitor can record uterine con-tractions on the lower part of the paper strip. This helps thedoctor or midwife determine how a baby is handling thestress of contractions. The normal pattern is for the baby’s
heartbeat to drop slightly during a contraction and then goback to normal after the contraction is over. EFM looks forany changes from this normal pattern, particularly if there isa drastic drop in the baby’s heart beat or if the heart ratedoes not recover immediately after a contraction.

"Because it is an indirect test, it is not perfect. When
an adult complains to a provider about not feeling well,checking the heart rate is only one of many things thatthe doctor will do. With an unborn baby, however, check-ing the heart rate is basically the only thing that a doctoror midwife can do.

toward the end of pregnancy, a baby can be checkedevery week or every other week with a non-stress test. Inthis test, changes in the baby’s heart rate are measuredalong with the fetus’ own movements. The heart rate of ahealthy baby should go up whenever she or he moves.
Fetal monitoring is used on and off during early
labor. As labor progresses, more monitoring is oftenneeded. Usually, as the time for delivery nears, the moni-tor is left on continuously since the end of labor tends tobe the most stressful time for the baby.
A baby who is having trouble in labor will show char-
acteristic changes in heart rate after a contraction (latedecelerations). If a baby is not receiving enough oxygen towithstand the stress of labor and delivery is many hoursaway, a cesarean section (C-section) may be necessary.

"Description
Using the external fetal monitor is simple and painless.
Two elastic belts are placed around the mother’s abdomen.One belt holds a listening device in place while the otherbelt holds the contraction monitor. The nurse or midwifeadjusts the belts to get the best readings from each device.
Sometimes, it is difficult to hear the baby’s heartbeat
with the external monitoring device. Other times, themonitor may show subtle signs of a developing problem.In either case, the doctor or midwife may recommend thatthe external belt be replaced with an internal monitor.
The internal monitor is an electronic wire that rests
directly on the baby’s head. The provider can place it onthe baby’s head during an internal exam. The internalmonitor can only be used when the cervix is alreadyopen. This device provides a more accurate record of thebaby’s heart rate.

"Hypoxia —An oxygen deficiency.Risks
External EFM poses no direct risks to the baby. How-
ever, because of being connected to the machine, themother cannot walk around. This inactivity may prolonglabor and reduce oxygen levels in the mother’s blood, bothof which can be detrimental to the unborn baby. Anotherproblem is that electronic fetal monitoring seems to beassociated with an increase in caesarian deliveries. Thereis a concern that EFM can give false alarms of distress inthe baby, and that this can lead to unneeded caesarians.With internal monitoring, there is a higher risk for infec-tion. For these and other reasons, the United States Pre-ventive Services Task Force states that there is some evi-dence that using electronic fetal monitoring on low-riskwomen in labor might not be indicated. Many physicians,however, continue to use EFM routinely, and believe it tobe of value in both low-risk and high-risk labors.

"Normal results
An unborn baby’s heart rate normally ranges from
120–160 beats per minute (bpm). A baby who is receiv-ing enough oxygen through the placenta will movearound. The monitor strip will show the baby’s heart raterising briefly as he/she moves (just as an adult’s heartrate rises when he/she moves).
The baby’s monitor strip is considered to be reactive
when the baby’s heart rate rises at least 20 bpm above thebaseline heart rate for at least 20 seconds. This mustoccur at least twice in a 20-minute period. A reactiveheart rate tracing (also known as a reactive non-stresstest) is considered a sign of the baby’s well being.
Abnormal results
If the baby’s heart rate drops very low or rises very
high, this signals a serious problem. In either of thesecases it is obvious that the baby is in distress and must bedelivered soon. However, many babies who are havingproblems do not give such clear signs.

"During a contraction, the flow of oxygen (from the
mother) through the placenta (to the baby) is temporarilystopped. It is as if the baby has to hold its breath duringeach contraction. Both the placenta and the baby aredesigned to withstand this condition. Between contrac-tions, the baby should be receiving more than enoughoxygen to do well during the contraction.
The first sign that a baby is not getting enough oxy-
gen between contractions is often a drop in the baby’sheart rate after the contraction (late deceleration). Thebaby’s heart rate recovers to a normal level between con-tractions, only to drop again after the next contraction.This is also a more subtle sign of distress.

Electrophysiology study of 
the heart
Definition
An electrophysiology (EP) study of the heart is a
nonsurgical analysis of the electrical conduction system(normal or abnormal) of the heart. The test employs car-diac catheters and sophisticated computers to generateelectrocardiogram (EKG) tracings and electrical mea-surements with exquisite precision from within the heartchambers.

"The EP study can be performed solely for diagnostic
purposes. It also is performed to pinpoint the exact loca-tion of electrical signals (cardiac mapping) in conjunctionwith a therapeutic procedure called catheter ablation .
The test is simple, not painful, and performed in a
special laboratory under controlled clinical circum-stances by cardiologists and nurses who subspecialize inelectrophysiology.
Purpose
A cardiologist may recommend an EP study when
the standard EKG, Holter monitor, event recorder, stress
test, echocardiogram, or angiogram cannot provide
enough information to evaluate an abnormal heartrhythm, called an arrhythmia.
An EP study also may be beneficial in diagnosing a
suspected arrhythmia in a patient who shows symptomsof an arrhythmia but in whom it could not be detectedfrom other tests.

"The purpose and great value of an EP study is that it
offers more detailed information to the doctor about theelectrical activity in the heart than the aforementionednoninvasive tests because electrodes are placed directlyonheart tissue. This allows the electrophysiologist to
determine the specific location of an arrhythmia and,oftentimes, correct it during the same procedure. Thiscorrective treatment is permanent and considered a cure,and, in many cases, the patient may not need to take heartmedications.
EP studies may be helpful in assessing:
• certain tachycardias or bradycardias of unknown
cause.
• patients who have been resuscitated after experiencing
sudden cardiac death .
• various symptoms of unknown cause, such as chest
pain ,shortness of breath ,fatigue , or syncope (dizzi-
ness/fainting).
• response to anti-arrhythmic therapy.

Pregnant patients should not undergo an EP study
because of exposure to radiation during the study, whichmay be harmful to the growing baby.
Patients who have coronary artery disease may

"Description
The rhythmic pumping action of the heart, which is
essentially a muscle, is the result of electrical impulsestraveling throughout the walls of the four heart cham-bers. These impulses originate in the sinoatrial (SA)node, which are specialized cells situated in the top rightchamber of the heart: the right atrium. Normally, the SAnode, acting like a spark plug, spontaneously generatesthe impulses, which travel through specific pathwaysthroughout the atria to the atrioventricular (A V) node.The A V node is a relay station, sending the impulses tomore specialized muscle fibers throughout the bottomchambers of the heart: the ventricles. If these pathwaysbecome damaged or blocked or if extra (abnormal) path-ways exist, the heart’s rhythm may be altered (perhapstoo slow, too fast, or irregular), which can seriouslyaffect the heart’s pumping ability.

"The patient is transported to the x-ray table in the EP
lab and connected to various monitors. Sterile sheets areplaced over him or her. A minimum of two catheters areinserted into the right femoral (thigh) vein in the groinarea. Depending on the type of arrhythmia, the numberof catheters used in an EP test and their route to the heartmay vary. For certain tachycardias, two more cathetersmay be inserted in the left groin and one in the internaljugular (neck) vein or in the subclavian (below the clavi-

"cle) vein. The catheters are about 0.08 in (2 mm) in
diameter, about the size of a spaghetti noodle. Thecatheters used in catheter ablation are slightly larger.
With the help of fluoroscopy (x rays on a television
screen), all the catheters are guided to several specificlocations in the heart. Typically, four to 10 electrodes arelocated on the end of the catheters, which have the abilityto send electrical signals to stimulate the heart (calledpacing) and to receive electrical signals from the heart—but not at the same time (just as a walkie-talkie cannotsend and receive messages at the same time).
First, the electrodes are positioned to receive signals
from inside the heart chambers. This allows the doctor tomeasure how fast the electrical impulses travel currentlyin the patient’s heart. These measurements are called thepatient’s baseline measurements. Next, the electrodes arepositioned to pace: The EP team actually tries to induce(sometimes in combination with various heart drugs) the"
"arrhythmia that the patient has previously experienced sothe team can observe it in a controlled environment,compare it to the patient’s clinical or spontaneousarrhythmia, and decide how to treat it.
Once the arrhythmia is induced and the team deter-
mines it can be treated with catheter ablation, cardiacmapping is performed to locate precisely the origin androute of the abnormal pathway. When this is accom-plished, the ablating electrode catheter is positioneddirectly against the abnormal pathway, and high radio-frequency energy is delivered through the electrode todestroy (burn) the tissue in this area.

"Risks
The EP diagnostic study and catheter ablation are low-
risk procedures. There is a small risk of bleeding and/orinfection at the site of catheter insertion, but this occurs lessthan 1% of the time. Blood clot formation occurs only twoin 1,000 instances and is minimized with blood thinnermedications administered during the procedure. Vascularinjuries causing hemorrhage or thrombophlebitis are pos-
sible but occur less than 0.7% of the time. Cardiac perfora-tions occur only in one or two per 1,000 instances. If theright internal jugular vein is accessed, the small possibilityof puncturing the lung with the catheter exists, which, atworst, could cause a collapsed lung.
Because ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation
(lethal arrhythmias ) may be induced in the patient, the
EP lab personnel must be prepared to defibrillate thepatient as necessary.

Elephantiasis

for the syndrome it describes: the gross (visible) enlarge-ment of the arms, legs, or genitals to elephantoid size.

"Description
True elephantiasis is the result of a parasitic infec-
tion caused by three specific kinds of round worms. Thelong, threadlike worms block the body’s lymphatic sys-tem—a network of channels, lymph nodes, and organsthat helps maintain proper fluid levels in the body bydraining lymph from tissues into the bloodstream. Thisblockage causes fluids to collect in the tissues, which canlead to great swelling, called “lymphedema.” Limbs canswell so enormously that they resemble an elephant’sforeleg in size, texture, and color. This is the severely dis-figuring and disabling condition of elephantiasis.
There are a few different causes of elephantiasis, but"
"There are a few different causes of elephantiasis, but
the agents responsible for most of the elephantiasis in theworld are filarial worms: white, slender round wormsfound in most tropical and subtropical places. They aretransmitted by particular kinds (species) of mosquitoes,that is, bloodsucking insects. Infection with these wormsis called “lymphatic filariasis” and over a long period oftime can cause elephantiasis.
Lymphatic filariasis is a disease of underdeveloped
regions found in South America, Central Africa, Asia, thePacific Islands, and the Caribbean. It is a disease that hasbeen present for centuries, as ancient Persian and Indianwritings clearly described elephant-like swellings of thearms, legs, and genitals. It is estimated that 120 millionpeople in the world have lymphatic filariasis, as of 1997.The disease appears to be spreading, in spite of decadesof research in this area.

"Other terms for elephantiasis are Barbados leg, ele-
phant leg, morbus herculeus, mal de Cayenne, andmyelolymphangioma.
Other situations that can lead to elephantiasis are:
• a protozoan disease called leishmaniasis
• a repeated streptococcal infection
• the surgical removal of lymph nodes (usually to prevent
the spread of cancer )
• a hereditary birth defect
Causes and symptoms
Three kinds of round worms cause elephantiasis filar-
iasis: Wuchereria bancrofti ,Brugia malayi , and Brugia
timori . Of these three, W. bancrofti makes up about 90% of
the cases. Man is the only known host of W. bancrofti .
Culex ,Aedes , and Anopheles mosquitoes are the car-
riers of W. bancrofti . Anopheles and Mansonia mosqui-
toes are the carriers of B. malayi . In addition, Anopheles
mosquitoes are the carriers of B. timori .

"mosquitoes are the carriers of B. timori .
Infected female mosquitoes take a blood meal from
a human, and, in doing so, introduce larval forms of theparticular parasite they carry to the person. These larvaemigrate toward a lymphatic channel, then travel to vari-ous places within the lymphatic system, usually position-ing themselves in or near lymph nodes throughout thebody. During this time, they mature into more developedlarvae and eventually into adult worms. Depending uponthe species of round worm, this development can take afew months or more than a year. The adult worms growto about 1 in (2.5 cm) to 4 in (10 cm) long.
The adult worms can live from about three to eight"
"The adult worms can live from about three to eight
years. Some have been known to live to 20 years, and inone case 40 years. The adult worms begin reproducingnumerous live embryos, called microfilariae. The micro-filariae travel to the bloodstream, where they can beingested by a mosquito when it takes a blood meal fromthe infected person. If they are not ingested by a mosqui-to, the microfilariae die within about 12 months. If theyare ingested by a mosquito, they continue to mature.They are totally dependent on their specific species ofmosquito to develop further. The cycle continues whenthe mosquito takes another blood meal.
Most of the symptoms an infected person experi-
ences are due to the blockage of the lymphatic system bythe adult worms and due to the substances (excretionsand secretions) produced by the worms.

"The body’s allergic reactions may include repeated
episodes of fever , shaking chills, sweating, headaches,
vomiting, and pain . Enlarged lymph nodes, swelling of
the affected area, skin ulcers, bone and joint pain, tired-ness, and red streaks along the arm or leg also may occur.Abscesses can form in lymph nodes or in the lymphaticvessels. They may appear at the surface of the skin as well.
Long-term infection with lymphatic filariasis can

"lead to lymphedema , hydrocele (a buildup of fluid in any
saclike cavity or duct) in the scrotum, and elephantiasis ofthe legs, scrotum, arms, penis, breasts, and vulvae. Themost common site of elephantiasis is the leg. It typicallybegins in the ankle and progresses to the foot and leg. Atfirst the swollen leg may feel soft to the touch but eventu-ally becomes hard and thick. The skin may appear dark-ened or warty and may even crack, allowing bacteria toinfect the leg and complicate the disease. The microfilari-ae usually don’t cause injury. In some instances, theycause “eosinophilia,” an increased number of eosinophils(a type of white blood cells) in the blood.
This disease is more intense in people who never
have been exposed to lymphatic filariasis than it is in thenative people of tropical areas where the disease occurs.This is because many of the native people often areimmunologically tolerant.

"Diagnosis
The only sure way to diagnose lymphatic filariasis is
by detecting the parasite itself, either the adult worms orthe microfilariae.
Microscopic examination of the person’s blood may
reveal microfilariae. But many times, people who havebeen infected for a long time do not have microfilariae intheir bloodstream. The absence of them, therefore, doesnot mean necessarily that the person is not infected. Inthese cases, examining the urine or hydrocele fluid orperforming other clinical tests is necessary.
Collecting blood from the individual for microscopic"
"Collecting blood from the individual for microscopic
examination should be done during the night when themicrofilariae are more numerous in the bloodstream.(Interestingly, this is when mosquitoes bite most frequent-ly.) During the day microfilariae migrate to deeper bloodvessels in the body, especially in the lung. If it is decidedto perform the blood test during the day, the infected indi-vidual may be given a “provocative” dose of medicationto provoke the microfilariae to enter the bloodstream.Blood then can be collected an hour later for examination.
Detecting the adult worms can be difficult because
they are deep within the lymphatic system and difficult toget to. Biopsies usually are not performed because theyusually don’t reveal much information.Treatment
The drug of choice in treating lymphatic filariasis is
diethylcarbamazine (DEC). The trade name in the UnitedStates is Hetrazan.
The treatment schedule is typically 2 mg/kg per day,"
"The treatment schedule is typically 2 mg/kg per day,
three times a day, for three weeks. The drug is taken intablet form.
DEC kills the microfilariae quickly and injures or
kills the adult worms slowly, if at all. If all the adultworms are not killed, remaining paired males andfemales may continue to produce more larvae. There-fore, several courses of DEC treatment over a longtime period may be necessary to rid the individual ofthe parasites.
DEC has been shown to reduce the size of enlarged
lymph nodes and, when taken long-term, to reduce ele-phantiasis. In India, DEC has been given in the form of amedicated salt, which helps prevent spread of the disease.

"The side effects of DEC almost all are due to the
body’s natural allergic reactions to the dying parasitesrather than to the DEC itself. For this reason, DEC mustbe given carefully to reduce the danger to the individual.Side effects may include fever, chills, headache ,dizzi-
ness,nausea and vomiting ,itching , and joint pain.
These side effects usually occur within the first few daysof treatment. These side effects usually subside as theindividual continues taking the drug.
There is an alternate treatment plan for the use of
DEC. This plan is designed to kill the parasites slowly (toreduce allergic reactions to the dead microfilariae anddying adult worms within the body). Lower doses of DECare taken for the first few days, followed by the higherdose of 2 mg/kg per day for the remaining three weeks. Inaddition, steroids may be prescribed to prevent the indi-vidual’s body from reacting severely to the dead worms.

"Prognosis
With DEC treatment, the prognosis is good for early
and mild cases of lymphatic filariasis. The prognosis ispoor, however, for heavy parasitic infestations.
Prevention
The two main ways to control this disease are to take
DEC preventively, which has shown to be effective, andto reduce the number of carrier insects in a particular area.
Avoiding mosquito bites with insecticides and insect
repellents is helpful, as is wearing protective clothingand using bed netting.
Much effort has been made in cleaning the breeding
sites (stagnant water) of mosquitoes near people’s homesin areas where filariasis is found.
Before visiting countries where lymphatic filariasis
is found, it would be wise to consult a travel physician tolearn about current preventative measures.

Embolism
Definition
An embolism is an obstruction in a blood vessel due
to a blood clot or other foreign matter that gets stuckwhile traveling through the bloodstream. The plural ofembolism is emboli.
Description
Emboli have moved from the place where they were
formed through the bloodstream to another part of thebody, where they obstruct an artery and block the flow ofblood. The emboli are usually formed from blood clotsbut are occasionally comprised of air, fat, or tumor tis-sue. Embolic events can be multiple and small, or singleand massive. They can be life-threatening and requireimmediate emergency medical care. There are three gen-eral categories of emboli: arterial, gas, and pulmonary.Pulmonary emboli are the most common.

"Arterial embolism
In arterial emboli, blood flow is blocked at the junc-
tion of major arteries, most often at the groin, knee, orthigh. Arterial emboli are generally a complication ofheart disease. An arterial embolism in the brain (cere-bral embolism) causes stroke , which can be fatal. An
estimated 5–14% of all strokes are caused by cerebralemboli. Arterial emboli to the extremities can lead to tis-sue death and amputation of the affected limb if not
treated effectively within hours. Intestines and kidneyscan also suffer damage from emboli.
Gas embolism
Gas emboli result from the compression of respira-
tory gases into the blood and other tissues due to rapidchanges in environmental pressure, for example, whileflying or scuba diving. As external pressure decreases,gases (like nitrogen) that are dissolved in the blood andother tissues become small bubbles that can block bloodflow and cause organ damage.
Pulmonary embolism

"Pulmonary embolism
In a pulmonary embolism , a common illness, blood
flow is blocked at a pulmonary artery. When emboli blockthe main pulmonary artery, and in cases where there areno initial symptoms, a pulmonary embolism can quicklybecome fatal. According to the American Heart Associa-tion, an estimated 600,000 Americans develop pulmonaryemboli annually and 60,000 die from it.
A pulmonary embolism is difficult to diagnose. Less
than 10% of patients who die from a pulmonaryembolism were diagnosed with the condition. More than90% of cases of pulmonary emboli are complications ofdeep vein thrombosis , blood clots in the deep vein of
the leg or pelvis.

Arterial emboli are usually a complication of heart
disease where blood clots form in the heart’s chambers.Gas emboli are caused by rapid changes in environmen-tal pressure that could happen when flying or scuba div-ing. A pulmonary embolism is caused by blood clots thattravel through the blood stream to the lungs and block apulmonary artery. More than 90% of the cases of pul-monary embolism are a complication of deep veinthrombosis, which typically occurs in patients who havehad orthopedic surgery and patients with cancer or
other chronic illnesses like congestive heart failure .

as narcotics and antihistamines .
Common symptoms of a pulmonary embolism
include:
• labored breathing, sometimes accompanied by chest
pain
• a rapid pulse
•a  cough that may produce sputum
• a low-grade fever
• fluid build-up in the lungs
Less common symptoms include:
• coughing up blood• pain caused by movement or breathing
• leg swelling
• bluish skin• fainting• swollen neck veins
Symptoms of an arterial embolism include:
• severe pain in the area of the embolism
• pale, bluish cool skin
• numbness• tingling• muscular weakness or paralysis
Diagnosis
An embolism can be diagnosed through the patient’s
history, a physical exam, and diagnostic tests. For arterialemboli, cardiac ultrasound and/or arteriography areordered. For a pulmonary embolism, a chest x ray , lung
scan, pulmonary angiography ,electrocardiography ,arterial blood gas measurements, and venography or
venous ultrasound could be ordered."
"venous ultrasound could be ordered.
Diagnosing an arterial embolism
Ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of
the heart, organs, or arteries. The technician applies gelto a hand-held transducer then presses it against thepatient’s body. The ultrasound’s sound waves arteries areconverted into an image that can be displayed on a moni-tor. Performed in an outpatient diagnostic laboratory, thetest takes 30–60 minutes.
An arteriogram is an x ray in which a contrast medi-
um is injected to make the arteries visible on the x ray. Itcan be performed in a radiology unit, outpatient clinic, ordiagnostic center of a hospital.

"Diagnosing a pulmonary embolism
A chest x ray can show fluid build-up and detect
other respiratory diseases. The perfusion lung scan showspoor flow of blood in areas beyond blocked arteries. Thepatient inhales a small amount of radiopharmaceuticaland pictures of airflow into the lungs are taken with agamma camera. Then a different radiopharmaceutical isinjected into an arm vein and lung blood flow is scanned.A normal result essentially rules out a pulmonaryembolism. A lung scan can be performed in a hospital oran outpatient facility and takes about 45 minutes.
Pulmonary angiography is the most reliable test for"
"Pulmonary angiography is the most reliable test for
diagnosing a pulmonary embolism but it is not used oftenbecause it is expensive, invasive, and not readily availablein most hospitals. Pulmonary angiography is a radiographictest which involves injection of a radio contrast agent toshow the pulmonary arteries. A cinematic camera recordsthe blood flow through the patient, who lies on a table. Pul-monary angiography is usually performed in a hospital’sradiology medicine department and takes 30–60 minutes.
An electrocardiograph shows the heart’s electrical
activity and helps distinguish a pulmonary embolismfrom a heart attack. Electrodes covered with conductingjelly are placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs.Impulses of the heart’s activity are traced on paper. Thetest takes about 10 minutes.
Arterial blood gas measurements are sometimes
helpful but, alone, they are not diagnostic for pulmonaryembolism. Blood is taken from an artery instead of avein, usually in the wrist."
"Venography is used to look for the most likely
source of a pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis.It is very accurate, but it is not used often, because it ispainful, expensive, exposes the patient to a fairly highdose of radiation, and can cause complications. Venogra-

"phy identifies the location, extent, and degree of attach-
ment of the blood clots and enables the condition of thedeep leg veins to be assessed. A contrast solution isinjected into a foot vein through a catheter. The physicianobserves the movement of the solution through the veinwith a fluoroscope while a series of x rays are taken.Venography takes between 30–45 minutes and can bedone in a physician’s office, a laboratory, or a hospital.Radionuclide venography, in which a radioactive isotopeis injected, is occasionally used, especially if a patienthas had reactions to contrast solutions. Venous ultra-sound is the preferred evaluation of leg veins.
Treatment
Patients with emboli require immediate hospitaliza-
tion. They are generally treated with clot-dissolvingand/or clot-preventing drugs. Thrombolytic therapy to"
"dissolve blood clots is the definitive treatment for a verysevere pulmonary embolism. Streptokinase, urokinase,and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) areused. Heparin is the anticoagulant drug of choice for pre-venting formation of blood clots. Warfarin, an oral anti-coagulant, is sometimes used concurrently and is usuallycontinued after the hospitalization.
In the case of an arterial embolism, the affected limb
is placed in a dependent position and kept warm.Embolectomy is the treatment of choice in the majorityof early cases of arterial emboli in the extremities. In thisprocedure, a balloon-tipped catheter is inserted into theartery to remove thromboembolic matter.
With a pulmonary embolism, oxygen therapy is
often used to maintain normal oxygen concentrations.For people who can’t take anticoagulants and in someother cases, surgery may be needed to insert a device thatfilters blood returning to the heart and lungs.
Prognosis"
"Prognosis
Of patients hospitalized with an arterial embolism,
25–30% die, and 5–25% require amputation of a limb.About 10% of patients with a pulmonary embolism diesuddenly within the first hour of onset of the condition.The outcome for all other patients is generally good; only3% of patients die who are properly diagnosed early andtreated. In cases of an undiagnosed pulmonaryembolism, about 30% of patients die.
Prevention

graduated compression stockings and low-dose heparin is
significantly more effective than low-dose heparin alone.
Gradient elastic stockings, also called anti-embolism
stockings, decrease the risk of blood clots by compress-ing superficial leg veins and forcing blood into the deepveins. They can be knee-, thigh-, or waist-length. Manyphysicians order the use of stockings before surgery anduntil there is no longer an elevated risk of developingblood clots. The risk of deep vein thrombosis aftersurgery is reduced 50% with the use of these stockings.The American Heart Association recommends that theuse of graduated compression stockings be consideredfor all high-risk surgical patients."
"Intermittent pneumatic compression involves wrap-
ping knee- or thigh-high cuffs around the legs to preventblood clots. The cuffs are connected to a pump whichinflates and deflates, mimicking the heart’s normal pump-ing action and reducing the pooling of blood. Intermittentpneumatic compression can be used during surgery andrecovery and continues until there is no longer an elevatedrisk of developing blood clots. The American Heart Asso-ciation recommends the use of intermittent pneumaticcompression for patients who cannot take anticoagulants,for example, spinal cord and brain trauma patients.

Emphysema
Definition
Emphysema is a chronic respiratory disease where
there is over-inflation of the air sacs (alveoli) in thelungs, causing a decrease in lung function, and often,breathlessness.
Description
Emphysema is the most common cause of death"
"Description
Emphysema is the most common cause of death
from respiratory disease in the United States, and is thefourth most common cause of death overall. There are1.8 million Americans with the disease, which ranks fif-teenth among chronic conditions that cause limitations ofactivity. The disease is usually caused by smoking , but a
small number of cases are caused by an inherited defect.
Normally functioning lungs are elastic, efficiently"
"Normally functioning lungs are elastic, efficiently
expanding and recoiling as air passes freely through thebronchus to the alveoli, where oxygen is moved into theblood and carbon dioxide is filtered out. When a personinhales cigarette smoke or certain other irritants, his orher immune system responds by releasing substancesthat are meant to defend the lungs against the smoke.These substances can also attack the cells of the lungs,but the body normally inhibits such action with therelease of other substances. In smokers and those withthe inherited defect, however, no such prevention occursand the lung tissue is damaged in such a way that it losesits elasticity. The small passageways (bronchioles) lead-ing to the alveoli collapse, trapping air within the alveoli.The alveoli, unable to recoil efficiently and move the airout, over expand and rupture. As the disease progresses,coughing and shortness of breath occur. In the later"
"stages, the lungs cannot supply enough oxygen to theblood. Emphysema often occurs with other respiratorydiseases, particularly chronic bronchitis . These two dis-
eases are often referred to as one disorder called chronicobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Emphysema is most common among people aged 50
and older. Those with inherited emphysema may experiencethe onset as early as their thirties or fourties Men are morelikely than women to develop emphysema, but female casesare increasing as the number of female smokers rises.

"Causes and symptoms
Heavy cigarette smoking causes about 80–90% of
all emphysema cases. However a few cases are the resultof an inherited deficiency of a substance called alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT). The number of Americans with thisdeficiency is relatively small, probably no greater than70,000. Pipe, cigar, and marijuana smoking can alsodamage the lungs. While a person may be less likely toinhale cigar and pipe smoke, these types of smoke canalso impair lung function. Marijuana smoke may be evenmore damaging because it is inhaled deeply and held inby the smoker.
The symptoms of emphysema develop gradually
over many years. It is a common occurrence for manyemphysema patients to have lost over half of their func-tioning lung tissue before they become aware that some-thing is wrong. Shortness of breath, a chronic mild cough
(which may be productive of large amounts of dark, thicksputum, and often dismissed as “smoker’s cough”), andsometimes weight loss are associated with emphysema."

"Initially, a patient may only notice shortness of breath
when he or she is exercising. However, as the disease pro-gresses, it will occur with less exertion or no exertion atall. Emphysema patients may also develop an enlarged, or“barrel,” chest. Other symptoms may be skipped breaths,difficulty sleeping, morning headaches, increased diffi-culty breathing while lying down, chronic fatigue , and
swelling of the feet, ankles, or legs. Those with emphyse-ma are at risk for a variety of other complications result-ing from weakened lung function, including pneumonia .

"Diagnosis
A variety of pulmonary function tests may be
ordered. In the early stages of emphysema, the onlyresult may be dysfunction of the small airways. Patientswith emphysema may show an increase in the totalamount of air that is in the lungs (total lung capacity), buta decrease in the amount of air that can be breathed outafter taking a deep breath (vital capacity). With severeemphysema, vital capacity is substantially below normal.Spirometry, a procedure that measures air flow and lungvolume, helps in the diagnosis of emphysema.
A chest x ray is often ordered to aid in the diagnosis"
"A chest x ray is often ordered to aid in the diagnosis
of emphysema, though patients in the early stages of thedisease may have normal findings. Abnormal findings onthe chest x ray include over-inflation of the lungs and anabnormally increased chest diameter. The diaphragm mayappear depressed or flattened. In addition, patients withadvanced emphysema may show a smaller or verticalheart. The physician may observe blisters in the lungs andbulging of the accessory muscles of the respiratory sys-tem. Late in the disease, an EKG will show signs of rightventricular failure in the heart and increased hemoglobindue to lower levels of oxygen in the patient’s blood.

"Treatment
Treatment methods for emphysema do not cure or
reverse the damage to the lungs. However, they may slowthe progression of the disease, relieve symptoms, andhelp control possibly fatal complications. The first stepin treatment for smokers is to quit, so as to prevent anyfurther deterioration of breathing ability. Smoking cessa-tion programs may be effective. Consistent encourage-ment along with the help of health care professionals aswell as family and friends can help increase the successrate of someone attempting to quit.
If the patient and the health care team develop and
maintain a complete program of respiratory care, disabil-ity can be decreased, acute episodes of illness may beprevented, and the number of hospitalizations reduced.However, only quitting smoking has been shown to slowdown the progression of the disease, and among all othertreatments, only oxygen therapy has shown an increase
in the survival rate.

"in the survival rate.
Home oxygen therapy may improve the survival
times in those patients with advanced emphysema whoalso have low blood oxygen levels. It may improve thepatient’s tolerance of exercise , as well as improve their
performance in certain aspects of brain function andmuscle coordination. The functioning of the heart mayalso improve with an increased concentration of oxygenin the blood. Oxygen may also decrease insomnia and
headaches. Some patients may only receive oxygen atnight, but studies have illustrated that it is most effectivewhen administered at least 18, but preferably 24 hoursper day. Portable oxygen tanks prescribed to patientscarry a limited supply and must be refilled on a regularbasis by a home health provider. Medicare and mostinsurance companies cover a large proportion of the costof home oxygen therapy. Patients should be instructedregarding special safety issues involving the transportand presence of oxygen in the home."
"A variety of medications may be used in the treat-
ment of emphysema. Usually the patient responds best toa combination of medicines, rather than one single drug.
Bronchodilators are sometimes used to help alle-
viate the patient’s symptoms by relaxing and openingthe airways. They can be inhaled, taken by mouth, orinjected. Another category of medication often used iscorticosteroids or steroids. These help to decrease the

"inflammation of the airway walls. They are occasional-
ly used if bronchodilators are ineffective in preventingairway obstruction. Some patients’ lung functionimproves with corticosteroids, and inhaled steroids maybe beneficial to patients with few side effects. A varietyof antibiotics are frequently given at the first sign of a
respiratory infection, such as increased amounts of spu-tum, or if there has been a change in the color of thesputum. Expectorants can help to loosen respiratory
secretions, enabling the patient to more easily expelthem from the airways.
Many of the medications prescribed involve the use
of a metered dose inhaler (MDI) that may require specialinstruction to be used correctly. MDIs are a convenientand safe method of delivering medication to the lungs.However, if they are used incorrectly the medication willnot get to the right place. Proper technique is essentialfor the medication to be effective.

"For some patients, surgical treatment may be the
best option. Lung volume reduction surgery is a surgicalprocedure in which the most diseased parts of the lungare removed to enable the remaining lung and breathingmuscles to work more efficiently. Preliminary studiessuggest improved survival rates and better functioningwith the surgery. Another surgical procedure used foremphysema patients is lung transplantation . Trans-
plantation may involve one or both lungs. However, it isa risky and expensive procedure, and donor organs maynot be available.For those patients with advanced emphysema, keep-

"• Postural drainage. This helps to remove secretions from
the airways. The patient lies in a position that allowsgravity to aid in draining different parts of the lung.This is often done after the patient inhales an aerosolmedication. The basic position involves the patientlying on the bed with his chest and head over the sideand the forearms resting on the floor.
• Chest percussion. This technique involves lightly clap-
ping the back and chest, and may help to loosen thicksecretions.
• Coughing and deep breathing. These techniques may
aid the patient in bringing up secretions.
• Aerosol treatments. These treatments may involve solu-
tions of saline, often mixed with a bronchodilator,which are then inhaled as an aerosol. The aerosols thinand loosen secretions. A treatment normally takes 10 to15 minutes, and is given three or four times a day.

"Patients with COPD can learn to perform a variety
of self-help measures that may help improve their symp-toms and their ability to participate in everyday activi-ties. These measures include:
• Avoiding any exposure to dusts and fumes.• Avoiding air pollution, including the cigarette smoke of
others.
• Avoiding other people who have infections like the cold
or flu. Get a pneumonia vaccination and a yearly flu
shot.
• Drinking plenty of fluids. This helps to loosen respira-
tory secretions so they can be brought up more easilythrough coughing.
• Avoiding extreme temperatures of heat or cold. Also
avoiding high altitudes. (Special precautions can betaken that may enable the emphysema patient to fly ona plane.)
• Maintaining adequate nutritional intake. Normally a
high protein diet taken in many small feedings is rec-ommended.

"eficial. Aromatherapists have used essential oils like
eucalyptus, lavender, pine, and rosemary to help relievenasal congestion and make breathing easier. The herbelecampane may act as an expectorant to help patientsclear mucus from the lungs. The patient should discussthese remedies with their health care practitioner prior totrying them, as some may interact with the more tradi-tional treatments that are already being used.
Prognosis
Emphysema is a serious and chronic disease that
cannot be reversed. If detected early, the effects andprogression can be slowed, particularly if the patientstops smoking immediately. Complications of emphy-sema include higher risks for pneumonia and acutebronchitis. Overall, the prognosis for patients withemphysema is poor, with a survival rate for all thosewith COPD of four years, and even less for emphyse-ma. However, individual cases vary and many patientscan live much longer with supplemental oxygen andother treatment measures.
Prevention"
"Prevention
The best way to prevent emphysema is to avoid
smoking. Even patients with inherited emphysemashould avoid smoking, as it especially worsens the onsetand severity. If patients quit smoking as soon as evidenceof small airway obstruction begins, they can significantlyimprove their prognosis.

Empyema
Definition
Empyema is a condition in which pus and fluid from
infected tissue collects in a body cavity. The name comesfrom the Greek word empyein meaning pus-producing
(suppurate). Empyema is most often used to refer to col-lections of pus in the space around the lungs (pleural cav-ity), but sometimes refers to similar collections in thegall bladder or the pelvic cavity. Empyema in the pleuralcavity is sometimes called empyema thoracis, or empye-ma of the chest, to distinguish it from empyema else-where in the body.
Description
Empyema may have a number of causes but is most
frequently a complication of pneumonia . Its develop-"
"frequently a complication of pneumonia . Its develop-
ment can be divided into three phases: an acute phase inwhich the body cavity fills with a thin fluid containingsome pus; a second stage in which the fluid thickens anda fibrous, coagulation protein (fibrin) begins to accumu-late within the cavity; and a third or chronic stage inwhich the lung or other organ is encased within a thickcovering of fibrous material.
Causes and symptoms
Empyema thoracis can be caused by a number of dif-
ferent organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and amebas, inconnection with pneumonia, chest wounds , chest surgery,
lung abscesses, or a ruptured esophagus. The infectiveorganism can get into the pleural cavity either through thebloodstream or other circulatory system, in secretionsfrom lung tissue, or on the surfaces of surgical instrumentsor objects that cause open chest wounds. The most com-mon organisms that cause empyema are the following bac-teria: Streptococcus pneumoniae ,Haemophilus influenzae,"
"and Staphylococcus aureus . S. aureus is the most common
cause in all age groups, accounting for 90% of cases ofempyema in infants and children. Pelvic empyema in

"women is most often caused by Bacteroides strains or
Pseudomonas aeruginosa . In elderly, chronically ill, or
alcoholic patients, empyema is often caused by Klebsiella
pneumoniae species of bacteria.
When the disease organisms arrive in the cavity sur-
rounding the lungs, they infect the tissues that cover thelungs and line the chest wall. As the body attempts tofight off the infection, the cavity fills up with tissue fluid,pus, and dead tissue cells. Empyema of the gall bladderor pelvis results from similar reactions to infection inthose parts of the body.
The signs and symptoms of empyema vary some-
what according to the location of the infection and itsseverity. In empyema thoracis, patients usually exhibitsymptoms of pneumonia, including fever ,cough ,

tially life-threatening complications if the condition isnot treated.

"In pelvic empyema, the infection produces large
amounts of thick, foul-smelling pus that is rapidlyreplaced even after drainage. Empyema of the gallblad-der is marked by intense pain on the upper right side ofthe abdomen, high fever, and rigidity of the muscles overthe infected area.
Diagnosis
A physician may consider the possibility of empye-
ma thoracis in patients with pneumonia or other symp-toms of lung infection. When listening to sounds withinthe patient’s chest with a stethoscope, the sounds ofbreathing will be partly muffled and harder to hear in thepatients with empyema. The area of the chest over theinfection will sound dull when tapped or thumped (per-cussed). On an x ray, empyema thoracis will appear as acloudy or opaque area. The amount of fluid present in thepleural cavity can be estimated using an ultrasoundimaging procedure. The diagnosis of empyema, however,has to be confirmed with laboratory tests because itssymptoms can be caused by other disease conditions."
"The diagnosis of empyema is usually confirmed by
analyzing a sample of fluid taken from the pleural cavity.The sample is obtained by a procedure called thoracente-
sis. In this procedure, the patient is given a local anesthet-
ic, a needle is inserted into the pleural cavity through theback between the ribs on the infected side, and a sampleof fluid is withdrawn. If the patient has empyema, therewill be a very high level of one particular kind of immunecell (white blood cells), a high level of protein, and a verylow level of blood sugar. The fluid can also be tested forthe specific disease organism by staining or tissue cul-tures. In some cases, the color, smell, or consistency ofthe tissue fluid also helps to confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment
Empyema is treated using a combination of medica-
tions and surgical techniques. Treatment with medicationinvolves intravenously administering a two-week course"
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1176EmpyemaGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1176
"of antibiotics . It is important to give antibiotics as soon
as possible to prevent first-stage empyema from progress-ing to its later stages. The antibiotics most commonlyused are penicillin and vancomycin. Patients experiencingdifficulty breathing are also given oxygen therapy.
Surgical treatment of empyema has two goals:
drainage of the infected fluid and closing up of the spaceleft in the pleural cavity. If the infection is still in its earlystages, the fluid can be drained by thoracentesis. In sec-ond-stage empyema, the surgeon will insert a chest tube inthe patient’s rib cage or remove part of a rib (rib resection)in order to drain the fluid. In third-stage empyema, the sur-geon may cut or peel away the thick fibrous layer coatingthe lung. This procedure is called decortication. When thefibrous covering is removed, the lung will expand to fillthe space in the chest cavity. The doctor can use video-assisted thoracic surgery (V ATS) techniques to position"
"the chest tube or to perform a limited decortication. TheV ATS technique allows a physician to see within the bodyduring certain surgical procedures. Empyema of the gall-bladder is a serious condition that is treated with intra-venous antibiotics and surgical removal of the gallbladder.
Prognosis
The prognosis for recovery is generally good, except
in those cases with complications, such as a brain
abscess or blood poisoning , or cases caused by certain
types of streptococci.

Encephalitis
Definition
Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain, usually
caused by a direct viral infection or a hypersensitivityreaction to a virus or foreign protein. Brain inflammationcaused by a bacterial infection is sometimes calledcerebritis. When both the brain and spinal cord areinvolved, the disorder is called encephalomyelitis. Aninflammation of the brain’s covering, or meninges, iscalled meningitis .
Description
Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. The
inflammation is a reaction of the body’s immune systemto infection or invasion. During the inflammation, thebrain’s tissues become swollen. The combination of theinfection and the immune reaction to it can causeheadache and a fever , as well as more severe symptoms
in some cases.
Approximately 2,000 cases of encephalitis are
reported to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,GA each year. The viruses causing primary encephalitiscan be epidemic or sporadic. The polio virus is an epi-"
"demic cause. Arthropod-borne viral encephalitis isresponsible for most epidemic viral encephalitis. Theviruses live in animal hosts and mosquitos that transmitthe disease. The most common form of non-epidemic orsporadic encephalitis is caused by the herpes simplexvirus, type 1 (HSV-1) and has a high rate of death .
Mumps is another example of a sporadic cause.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
There are more than a dozen viruses that can cause
encephalitis, spread by either human-to human contact orby animal bites. Encephalitis may occur with severalcommon viral infections of childhood. Viruses and viraldiseases that may cause encephalitis include:
•chickenpox
•measles
• mumps
• Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1177EncephalitisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1177"
"• cytomegalovirus infection
• HIV
• herpes simplex
• herpes zoster ( shingles )
• herpes B
• polio
•rabies
• mosquito-borne viruses (arboviruses)
Primary encephalitis is caused by direct infection by
the virus, while secondary encephalitis is due to a post-infectious immune reaction to viral infection elsewhere inthe body. Secondary encephalitis may occur with measles,chickenpox, mumps, rubella , and EBV . In secondary
encephalitis, symptoms usually begin five to 10 days afterthe onset of the disease itself and are related to the break-down of the myelin sheath that covers nerve fibers.
In rare cases, encephalitis may follow vaccination
against some of the viral diseases listed above.Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a very rare brain disorder
caused by an infectious particle called a prion, may alsocause encephalitis.
Mosquitoes spread viruses responsible for equine
encephalitis (eastern and western types), St. Louisencephalitis, California encephalitis, and Japanese"
"encephalitis . Lyme disease , spread by ticks, can cause
encephalitis, as can Colorado tick fever. Rabies is mostoften spread by animal bites from dogs, cats, mice, rac-coons, squirrels, and bats and may cause encephalitis.
Equine encephalitis is carried by mosquitoes that do"
"Equine encephalitis is carried by mosquitoes that do
not normally bite humans but do bite horses and birds. Itis occasionally picked up from these animals by mosqui-toes that do bite humans. Japanese encephalitis and St.Louis encephalitis are also carried by mosquitoes. Therisk of contracting a mosquito-borne virus is greatest inmid- to late summer, when mosquitoes are most active,in those rural areas where these viruses are known toexist. Eastern equine encephalitis occurs in eastern andsoutheastern United States; western equine and Califor-nia encephalitis occur throughout the West; and St. Louisencephalitis occurs throughout the country. Japaneseencephalitis does not occur in the United States, but isfound throughout much of Asia. The viruses responsiblefor these diseases are classified as arbovirus and thesediseases are collectively called arbovirus encephalitis .
Herpes simplex encephalitis, the most common form"
"Herpes simplex encephalitis, the most common form
of sporadic encephalitis in western countries, is a diseasewith significantly high mortality. It occurs in children andadults and both sides of the brain are affected. It is theo-rized that brain infection is caused by the virus movingfrom a peripheral location to the brain via two nerves, the
olfactory and the trigeminal (largest nerves in the skull).
Herpes simplex encephalitis is responsible for 10%
of all encephalitis cases and is the main cause of spo-radic, fatal encephalitis. In untreated patients, the rate ofdeath is 70% while the mortality is 15–20% in patientswho have been treated with acyclovir. The symptoms ofherpes simplex encephalitis are fever, rapidly disintegrat-ing mental state, headache, and behavioral changes.

• decreased consciousness (drowsiness, confusion, delir-

• stiff neck• seizures
Symptoms may progress rapidly, changing from
mild to severe within several days or even several hours.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of encephalitis includes careful question-
ing to determine possible exposure to viral sources. Teststhat can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out otherdisorders include:
• Blood tests. These are to detect antibodies to viral anti-
gens, and foreign proteins.
• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (spinal tap). This detects
viral antigens, and provides culture specimens for thevirus or bacteria that may be present in the cere-brospinal fluid.
• Electroencephalogram (EEG).
• CT and MRI scans.

"• CT and MRI scans.
A brain biopsy (surgical gathering of a small tissue
sample) may be recommended in some cases wheretreatment to date has been ineffective and the cause ofthe encephalitis is unclear. Definite diagnosis by biopsymay allow specific treatment that would otherwise betoo risky.

"Treatment
Choice of treatment for encephalitis will depend on
the cause. Bacterial encephalitis is treated with antibi-
otics . Viral encephalitis is usually treated with antiviral
drugs including acyclovir, ganciclovir, foscarnet, ribo-
varin, and AZT. Viruses that respond to acyclovir includeherpes simplex, the most common cause of sporadic(non-epidemic) encephalitis in the United States.
The symptoms of encephalitis may be treated with a
number of different drugs. Corticosteroids , including
prednisone and dexamethasone, are sometimes pre-scribed to reduce inflammation and brain swelling. Anti-
convulsant drugs , including dilantin and phenytoin, are
used to control seizures. Fever may be reduced withacetaminophen or other fever-reducing drugs.
A person with encephalitis must be monitored care-
fully, since symptoms may change rapidly. Blood testsmay be required regularly to track levels of fluids andsalts in the blood.
Prognosis
Encephalitis symptoms may last several weeks."
"Prognosis
Encephalitis symptoms may last several weeks.
Most cases of encephalitis are mild, and recovery is usu-ally quick. Mild encephalitis usually leaves no residualneurological problems. Overall, approximately 10% ofthose with encephalitis die from their infections or com-plications such as secondary infection. Some forms ofencephalitis have more severe courses, including herpesencephalitis, in which mortality is 15–20% with treat-ment, and 70–80% without.

"Prevention
Because encephalitis is due to infection, it may be
prevented by avoiding the infection. Minimizing contactwith others who have any of the viral illness listed abovemay reduce the chances of becoming infected. Mostinfections are spread by hand-to-hand or hand-to-mouthcontact; frequent hand washing may reduce the likeli-hood of infection if contact cannot be avoided.
Mosquito-borne viruses may be avoided by prevent-
ing mosquito bites. Mosquitoes are most active at dawnand dusk, and are most common in moist areas withstanding water. Minimizing exposed skin and use ofmosquito repellents on other areas can reduce thechances of being bitten.KEY TERMS

Endarterectomy
Definition
Endarterectomy is an operation to remove or bypass
the fatty deposits, or blockage, in an artery narrowed bythe buildup of fatty tissue ( atherosclerosis ).
Purpose
Removing the fatty deposits restores normal blood
flow to the part of the body supplied by the artery. Anendarterectomy is performed to treat cerebrovascular dis-ease in which there is a serious reduction of blood supplyto the brain (carotid endarterectomy), or to treat periph-
eral vascular disease (impaired blood supply to the legs).
Endarterectomy is most often performed on one of"
"Endarterectomy is most often performed on one of
the two main arteries in the neck (the carotids) openingthe narrowed arteries leading to the brain. When per-formed by an experienced surgeon, the practice isextremely effective, reducing the risk of stroke by up to
70%. Recent studies indicate it is effective in preventingstroke, even among those patients who had no warningsigns except narrowed arteries detected by their doctorson a routine exam.
Precautions
Before the surgery, a full medical exam is usually
done to assess any specific health problems, such as dia-betes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke. Ifpossible, reversible health problems, such as cigarettesmoking or being overweight, should be corrected.

"Description
Carotid artery disease
Every person has four carotid arteries (the internal
and external carotids on each side of the neck) throughwhich blood from the heart moves into the brain. If oneof these arteries becomes blocked by fat and cholesterol,the patient may have a range of symptoms, including:• weakness in one arm, leg, half of the face, or one entire
side of the body
• numbness tingling•paralysis of an arm, leg, or face
• slurred speech
• dizziness
• confusion, fainting, or coma
• stroke
Removing this fatty buildup, or bypassing a blocked
segment, may restore blood flow to the brain, eliminateor decrease the symptoms, and lessen the risk of a stroke.
Peripheral vascular disease
When the blood vessels in the legs (and sometimes
the arms) become narrowed, this can restrict blood flowand cause pain in the affected area. In severe cases, the

"tissue may die, requiring amputation .
The narrowing is usually caused by buildup of fatty
plaques in the vessels, often as the result of smoking,high blood pressure, or poorly-controlled diabetes melli-
tus. The vessels usually narrow slowly, but it’s possible
for a blood clot to form quickly, causing sudden severepain in the affected leg or arm.
Procedure
Endarterectomy is a delicate operation that may
require several hours. The surgeon begins by making an
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1180EndarterectomyGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1180"
"incision over the blocked artery and inserting a tube
above and below the blockage to redirect the blood flowwhile the artery is opened.
Next, the surgeon removes the fat and cholesterol
buildup, along with any blood clots that have formed,with a blunt dissecting instrument. Then the surgeonbathes the clean wall in salt solution combined withheparin, an anticoagulant. Then the surgeon stitches theartery just enough so that the bypass shunt tube can beremoved, and then he/she stitches the artery completelyclosed. After checking to make sure no blood is leaking,the surgeon next closes the skin incision with stitches.
The operation should improve symptoms, although
its long-term effects may be more limited, since arterialnarrowing is rarely confined to one area of one artery. Ifnarrowing is a problem throughout the body, arterialreconstructive surgery may be required.

"The total cost of an endarterectomy, including diag-
nostic tests, surgery, hospitalization, and follow-up care,will vary according to hospital, doctor, and area of thecountry where the operation is performed, but a patientcan expect to pay in the range of $15,000. Patients who
are very young, very old, or very ill, or who need moreextensive surgery, may require more expensive treatment.
Preparation
Before surgery, the doctor pinpoints the location of
the narrowed artery with an x-ray procedure calledangiography . For surgery to be effective, the degree of
narrowing should be at least 70%, but it should not betotal. Patients undergoing angiography are given a localanesthetic, but the endarterectomy itself requires the useof a general anesthesia.

"Aftercare
After the surgery, the patient spends the first two
days lying flat in bed. Patients who have had carotidendarterectomy should not bend the neck sharply duringthis time. Because the blood flow to the brain is nowgreatly increased, patients may experience a brief butsevere headache , or lightheadedness. There may be a
slight loss of sensation in the skin, or maybe a droop in

bruised during surgery. In time, this should correct itself.
Risks
The amount of risk depends on the hospital, the skill
of the surgeon, and the severity of underlying disease.Patients who have just had an acute stroke are at greatestrisk. During carotid artery surgery, blood flow is inter-rupted through the artery, so that paralysis and otherstroke symptoms may occur. These may resolve aftersurgery, or may result in permanent stroke. Paralysis isusually one-sided; other stroke symptoms may includeloss of half the field of vision, loss of sensation, doublevision, speech problems, and personality changes.

"Stroke —Damage to the part of the brain caused
by an interruption of the blood supply. In somecases, small pieces of plaque in the carotid arterymay break loose and block an artery in the brain.A narrowed carotid artery also can be the sourceof blood clots travelling to the brain, or the arterycan become completely clogged, blocking allblood flow to the brain.buildup of fat and cholesterol usually affects all arteries,
not just the one that was operated on. Affected arteries inother parts of the body may be equally clogged and poten-tially dangerous. Even arteries that were operated elec-tively will likely, begin to clog up again after the surgery.
For this reason, lifestyle changes (no smoking, low
fat, low cholesterol diet) are important, especially if dietand lifestyle contributed to the development of the prob-lem in the first place.

Endocarditis
Definition
The endocardium is the inner lining of the heart
muscle, which also covers the heart valves. When theendocardium becomes damaged, bacteria from the bloodstream can become lodged on the heart valves or heartlining. The resulting infection is known as endocarditis.

"Description
The endocardium lines all four chambers of the
heart—two at the top (the right and left atria) and two atthe bottom (the right and left ventricles)—through whichblood passes as the heart beats. It also covers the fourvalves (the tricuspid valve, the pulmonary valve, themitral valve, and the aortic valve), which normally open

"and close to allow the blood to flow in only one direction
through the heart during each contraction.
For the heart to pump blood efficiently, the four
chambers must contract and relax, and the four valvesmust open and close, in a well coordinated fashion. Bydamaging the valves or the walls of the heart chambers,endocarditis can interfere with the ability of the heart todo its job.
Endocarditis rarely occurs in people with healthy,
normal hearts. Rather, it most commonly occurs whenthere is damage to the endocardium. The endocardiummay be affected by a congenital heart defect, such asmitral valve prolapse , in which blood leaks through a
poorly functioning mitral valve back into the heart. Itmay also be damaged by a prior scarring of the heartmuscle, such as rheumatic fever , or replacement of a
heart valve. Any of these conditions can damage theendocardium and make it more susceptible to infection.
Bacteria can get into the blood stream (a condition"
"Bacteria can get into the blood stream (a condition
known as bacteremia ) in a number of different ways: It
may spread from a localized infection such as a urinarytract infection, pneumonia , or skin infection or get into
the blood stream as a result of certain medical condi-tions, such as severe periodontal disease ,colon cancer ,
or inflammatory bowel disease. It can enter the bloodstream during minor procedures, such as periodontalsurgery, tooth extractions, teeth cleaning, tonsil removal,prostate removal, or endoscopic examination. It can alsobe introduced through in-dwelling catheters, which areused for intravenous medications, intravenous feeding, ordialysis. In people who use intravenous drugs, the bacte-ria can enter the blood stream through unsterilized, cont-aminated needles and syringes. (People who are prone toendocarditis generally need to take prescribed antibi-
otics before certain surgical or dental procedures to help
prevent this infection.)"
"otics before certain surgical or dental procedures to help
prevent this infection.)
If not discovered and treated, infective endocarditis
can permanently damage the heart muscle, especially thevalves. For the heart to work properly, all four valvesmust be functioning well, opening at the right time to letblood flow in the right direction and closing at the righttime to keep the blood from flowing in the wrong direc-tion. If the valve is damaged, this may allow blood to flowbackward—a condition known as regurgitation. As aresult of a poorly functioning valve, the heart muscle hasto work harder to pump blood and may become weak-ened, leading to heart failure . Heart failure is a chronic
condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood wellenough to supply blood adequately to the body.
Another danger associated with endocarditis is that"
"Another danger associated with endocarditis is that
the vegetation formed by bacteria colonizing on heartvalves may break off, forming emboli. These embolimay travel through the circulation and become lodged in
blood vessels. By blocking the flow of blood, embolican starve various tissues of nutrients and oxygen, dam-aging them. For instance, an embolus lodged in theblood vessels of the lungs may cause pneumonia-likesymptoms. An embolus may also affect the brain, dam-aging nerve tissue, or the kidneys, causing kidney dis-ease. Emboli may also weaken the tiny blood vesselscalled capillaries, causing hemorrhages (leaking bloodvessels) throughout the body.
Causes and symptoms
Most cases of infective endocarditis occur in people
between the ages of 15 and 60, with a median age atonset of about 50 years. Men are affected about twice asoften as women are. Other factors that put people atincreased risk for endocarditis are congenital heart prob-"
"lems, heart surgery, previous episodes of endocarditis,and intravenous drug use.
While there is no single specific symptom of endo-
carditis, a number of symptoms may be present. Themost common symptom is a mild fever , which rarely
goes above 102°F (38.9°C). Other symptoms includechills, weakness, cough , trouble breathing, headaches,
aching joints, and loss of appetite.
Emboli may also cause a variety of symptoms,
depending on their location. Emboli throughout thebody may cause Osler’s nodes, small, reddish, painfulbumps most commonly found on the inside of fingersand toes. Emboli may also cause petechiae, tiny purple

"or red spots on the skin, resulting from hemorrhages
under the skin’s surface. Tiny hemorrhages resemblingsplinters may also appear under the fingernails or toe-nails. If emboli become lodged in the blood vessels ofthe lungs, they may cause coughing or shortness of
breath . Emboli lodged in the brain may cause symp-
toms of a mini-stroke, such as numbness, weakness, orparalysis on one side of the body or sudden vision loss
or double vision. Emboli may also damage the kidneys,causing blood to appear in the urine. Sometimes the cap-illaries on the surface of the spleen rupture, causing thespleen to become enlarged and tender to the touch. Any-one experiencing any of these symptoms should seekmedical help immediately.
Diagnosis
Doctors begin the diagnosis by taking a history, ask-
ing the patient about the symptoms mentioned above.During a physical examination , the doctor may also"
"uncover signs such as fever, an enlarged spleen, signs ofkidney disease, or hemorrhaging. Listening to thepatient’s chest with a stethoscope, the doctor may alsohear a heart murmur. A heart murmur may indicateabnormal flow of blood through one of the heart cham-bers or valves.
Doctors take a sample of the patient’s blood to test it
for bacteria and other microorganisms that may be caus-ing the infection. They usually also use a test calledechocardiography , which uses ultrasound waves to
make images of the heart, to check for abnormalities inthe structure of the heart wall or valves. One of the tell-tale signs they look for in echocardiography is vegeta-tion, the abnormal growth of tissue around a valve com-posed of blood platelets, bacteria, and a clotting proteincalled fibrin. Another tell-tale sign is regurgitation, or the"
"backward flow of blood, through one of the heart valves.A normal echocardiogram does not exclude the possibili-ty of endocarditis, but an abnormal echocardiogram canconfirm its presence. If an echocardiogram cannot bedone or its results are inconclusive, a modified techniquecalled transesophageal echocardiography is some-
times performed. Transesophageal echocardiographyinvolves passing an ultrasound device into the esophagusto get a clearer image of the heart.
Treatment
When doctors suspect infective endocarditis, they
will admit the patient to a hospital and begin treating theinfection before they even have the results of the blood
culture . Their choice of antibiotics depends on what the
most likely infecting microorganism is. Once the resultsof the blood culture become available, the doctor canadjust the medications, using specific antibiotics knownto be effective against the specific microorganisminvolved.

"Unfortunately, in recent years, the treatment of
endocarditis has become more complicated as a result ofantibiotic resistance. Over the past few years, especiallyas antibiotics have been overprescribed, more and morestrains of bacteria have become increasingly resistant toa wider range of antibiotics. For this reason, doctors mayneed to try a few different types of antibiotics—or even acombination of antibiotics—to successfully treat theinfection. Antibiotics are usually given for about onemonth, but may need to be given for an even longer peri-od of time if the infection is resistant to treatment.
Once the fever and the worst of the symptoms have"
"Once the fever and the worst of the symptoms have
gone away, the patient may be able to continue antibiotictherapy at home. During this time, the patient shouldmake regular visits to the health care team for furthertesting and physical examination to make sure that theantibiotic therapy is working, that it is not causingadverse side effects, and that there are no complicationssuch as emboli or heart failure. The patient should alertthe health-care team to any symptoms that could indicateserious complications: For instance, trouble breathing orswelling in the legs could indicate congestive heart fail-ure. Headache , joint pain , blood in the urine, or stroke
symptoms could indicate an embolus, and fever andchills could indicate that the treatment is not working andthe infection is worsening. Finally, diarrhea , rash, itch-
ing, or joint pain may suggest a bad reaction to the
antibiotics. Anyone experiencing any of these symptomsshould alert the health care team immediately."

ly functioning heart valves, and endocarditis involvingprosthetic (artificial) valves. The most common surgicaltreatment involves cutting away (debriding) damaged tis-sue and replacing the damaged valve.
Prognosis
If left untreated, infective endocarditis continues to
progress and is always fatal. However, if it is diagnosedand properly treated within the first six weeks of infec-tion, the infection can be completely cured in about 90%of the cases. The prognosis depends on a number of fac-tors, such as the patient’s age and overall physical condi-tion, the severity of the diseases involved, the exact siteof the infection, how vulnerable the microorganisms areto antibiotics, and what kind of complications the endo-carditis may be causing.

"Endometrial biopsy
Definition
Endometrial biopsy is a procedure in which a sam-
ple of the endometrium (tissue lining the inside of theuterus) is removed for microscopic examination.
Purpose
The test is most often performed to find out the
cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. Abnormal bleedingincludes bleeding between menstrual periods, excessivebleeding during a menstrual period, or bleeding aftermenopause . Since abnormal uterine bleeding can indi-
cate cancer , an endometrial biopsy is done to rule out
endometrial cancer or hyperplasia (a potentially pre-
cancerous condition).
Endometrial biopsies are also done as a screening
test for endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women onhormone replacement therapy . Hormone replacement"
"therapy usually requires a woman to take estrogen andprogesterone. An endometrial biopsy is particularly use-ful in cases where postmenopausal women take estrogen,but cannot take progesterone. Estrogen in the systemwithout the balancing effect of progesterone has beenlinked to an increased risk of endometrial cancer.
An endometrial biopsy can also be used as part of an
infertility exam to rule out problems with the develop-
ment of the endometrium. This condition is called lutealphase defect and can cause the endometrium to not sup-port a pregnancy . An endometrial biopsy can also be used
to evaluate the problem of repeated early miscarriages.

"Precautions
If the endometrial biopsy is being done to investigate
why a woman is unable to get pregnant, the test must beperformed at a specific time during the menstrual cycle.Since the test evaluates whether the endometrium isdeveloped adequately to support implantation and growthof a fertilized egg, it is critical to perform the test approxi-mately three days before the expected menstrual period.
Description
The test is performed by a doctor who specializes in
women’s reproductive health (an obstetrician/gynecolo-gist). The test is performed either in the doctor’s office orin a local hospital. The patient may be asked to take pain
medication (like Motrin or Aleve) an hour or so beforethe procedure. A local anesthetic may be injected into thecervix in order to decrease pain and discomfort duringthe procedure.The woman will be asked to lie on her back with"
"knees apart and feet in stirrups. The doctor will first con-duct a thorough exam of the pelvic region, including thevulva (the external genitals), vagina, and uterus. A specu-lum (an instrument that is used to hold the walls of thevagina open) will be inserted into the vagina. A small,hollow plastic tube is then passed into the uterine cavity.A small piece of the uterine lining is sucked out with aplunger that is attached to the tube. Once the sample isobtained, the instruments are removed. The sample issent to the laboratory for microscopic examination.
The patient may experience some pain when the
cervix is grasped. The patient may also feel some cramp-ing, pressure, and discomfort when the instruments areinserted into the uterus and the tissue sample is collected.

"Preparation
For the small number of endometrial biopsies that
are done as part of infertility testing, a pregnancy test isalso often performed before the procedure. Since thebiopsy is performed late in the menstrual cycle, it is pos-sible that the woman may be pregnant.
Aftercare
The biopsy may cause a small amount of bleeding
(spotting). The woman can resume normal activities rightaway. If cramping becomes severe, heavy bleedingoccurs, or the woman develops a high temperature, thedoctor should be notified immediately.
If the test is being done to determine the cause of
infertility, the onset of the menstrual period following thebiopsy should be reported to the doctor. This will allowthe doctor to correctly predict if the endometrium hasbeen developing at the expected rate.

"Risks
The risks of an endometrial biopsy are very small.
There is a possibility that prolonged bleeding may occurafter the procedure. There is also a slight chance of aninfection. Very rarely, there are instances when the uterusis pierced (perforated) or the cervix is torn because of thebiopsy.
Normal results
Most biopsies are done to rule out endometrial cancer
or endometrial hyperplasia. A normal result shows no can-cerous or precancerous cells. Normal results also showthat the uterine lining is changing at the proper rate. If it is,then the results of the biopsy are said to be “in-phase”because the tissue looks appropriate and has developednormally for the late phase of the menstrual cycle.
Abnormal results
If the endometrium is not developing at the appro-
priate rate, the results are said to be “out-of-phase” orabnormal. The endometrium has not developed appropri-ately and cannot support a pregnancy. This condition iscalled luteal phase defect and may need to be treated"
"with progesterone.
Abnormal appearance of the cells forming the uter-
ine tissue could also indicate uterine cancer, or the pres-ence of fibroids or polyps in the uterus.

"Endometrial cancer
Definition
Endometrial cancer develops when the cells that
make up the inner lining of the uterus (the endometrium)become abnormal and grow uncontrollably.
Description
Endometrial cancer (also called uterine cancer) is
the fourth most common type of cancer among womenand the most common gynecologic cancer. Approximate-ly 34,000 women are diagnosed with endometrial cancereach year. In 1998, approximately 6,300 women diedfrom this cancer. Although endometrial cancer generallyoccurs in women who have gone through menopause
and are 45 years of age or older, 30% of the women withendometrial cancer are younger than 40 years of age. Theaverage age at diagnosis is 60 years old.
The uterus, or womb, is the hollow female organ that
supports the development of the unborn baby duringpregnancy . The uterus has a thick muscular wall and an"
"inner lining called the endometrium. The endometrium isvery sensitive to hormones and it changes daily duringthe menstrual cycle. The endometrium is designed toprovide an ideal environment for the fertilized egg toimplant and begin to grow. If pregnancy does not occur,the endometrium is shed causing the menstrual period.
More than 95% of uterine cancers arise in the
endometrium. The most common type of uterine canceris adenocarcinoma. It arises from an abnormal multipli-cation of endometrial cells (atypical adenomatous hyper-plasia) and is made up of mature, specialized cells (well-differentiated). Less commonly, endometrial cancer aris-es without a preceding hyperplasia and is made up ofpoorly differentiated cells. The more common of thesetypes are the papillary serous and clear cell carcinomas.Poorly differentiated endometrial cancers are often asso-ciated with a less promising prognosis.
The highest incidence of endometrial cancer in the"
"The highest incidence of endometrial cancer in the
United States is in Caucasians, Hawaiians, Japanese, andAfrican Americans. American Indians, Koreans, andVietnamese have the lowest incidence. African Americanand Hawaiian women are more likely to be diagnosedwith advanced cancer and, therefore, have a higher riskof dying from the disease.
Causes and symptoms
Although the exact cause of endometrial cancer is
unknown, it is clear that high levels of estrogen, whennot balanced by progesterone, can lead to abnormalgrowth of the endometrium. Factors that increase awoman’s risk of developing endometrial cancer are:
• Age. The risk is considerably higher in women who are
over the age of 50 and have gone through menopause.
•Obesity . Being overweight is a very strong risk factor
for this cancer. Fatty tissue can change other normalbody chemicals into estrogen, which can promoteendometrial cancer.
• Estrogen replacement therapy. Women receiving estro-"
"• Estrogen replacement therapy. Women receiving estro-
gen supplements after menopause have a 12 times high-er risk of getting endometrial cancer if progesterone isnot taken simultaneously.
• Diabetes. Diabetics have twice the risk of getting this
cancer as nondiabetic women. It is not clear if this riskis due to the fact that many diabetics are also obese andhypertensive. One 1998 study found that women whowere obese and diabetic were three times more likely todevelop endometrial cancer than women who wereobese but nondiabetic. This study also found thatnonobese diabetics were not at risk of developingendometrial cancer.
•Hypertension . High blood pressure (or hypertension)
is also considered a risk factor for uterine cancer.
• Irregular menstrual periods. During the menstrual"
"• Irregular menstrual periods. During the menstrual
cycle, there is interaction between the hormones estro-gen and progesterone. Women who do not ovulate regu-larly are exposed to high estrogen levels for longer peri-ods of time. If a woman does not ovulate regularly, thisdelicate balance is upset and may increase her chancesof getting uterine cancer.
• Early first menstruation or late menopause. Having
the first period at a young age (the mean age ofmenses is 12.16 years in African American girls and12.88 years in caucasian girls) or going throughmenopause at a late age (over age 51) seem to putwomen at a slightly higher risk for developingendometrial cancer.

"breast cancer , increases a woman’s chance of develop-
ing endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen users tend to havemore advanced endometrial cancer with an associatedpoorer survival rate than those who do not take thedrug. In many cases, however, the value of tamoxifenfor treating breast cancer and for preventing the cancerfrom spreading far outweighs the small risk of gettingendometrial cancer.
• Family history. Some studies suggest that endometrial
cancer runs in certain families. Women with inheritedmutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are at ahigher risk of developing breast, ovarian, and othergynecologic cancers. Those with the hereditary non-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1188Endometrial cancerGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1188"
"polyposis colorectal cancer gene have a higher risk of
developing endometrial cancer.
• Breast, ovarian, or colon cancer . Women who have a
history of these other types of cancer are at an increasedrisk of developing endometrial cancer.
• Low parity or nulliparity. Endometrial cancer is more
common in women who have born few (low parity) orno (nulliparity) children. The high levels of proges-terone produced during pregnancy has a protectiveeffect against endometrial cancer. The results of onestudy suggest that nulliparity is associated with a lowersurvival rate.
• Infertility. Risk is increased due to nulliparity or the use
of fertility drugs.
• Polycystic ovary syndrome. The increased level of
estrogen associated with this abnormality raises the riskof cancers of the breast and endometrium.
The most common symptom of endometrial cancer"
"The most common symptom of endometrial cancer
is unusual vaginal spotting, bleeding, or discharge. Inwomen who are near menopause (perimenopausal),symptoms of endometrial cancer could include bleedingbetween periods (intermenstrual bleeding), heavy bleed-ing that lasts for more than seven days, or short menstru-al cycles (fewer than 21 days). For women who havegone through menopause, any vaginal bleeding or abnor-
mal discharge is suspect. Pain in the pelvic region and
the presence of a lump (mass) are symptoms that occurlate in the disease.
Diagnosis
If endometrial cancer is suspected, a series of tests
will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis. The firststep will involve taking a complete personal and familymedical history. A physical examination , which will
include a thorough pelvic examination, will also bedone.

"The doctor may order an endometrial biopsy . This
is generally performed in the doctor’s office and does notrequire anesthesia. A thin, flexible tube is insertedthrough the cervix and into the uterus. A small piece ofendometrial tissue is removed. The patient may experi-ence some discomfort, which can be minimized by tak-ing an anti-inflammatory medication (like Advil orMotrin) an hour before the procedure.
If an adequate amount of tissue was not obtained by
the endometrial biopsy, or if the biopsy tissue looksabnormal but confirmation is needed, the doctor may per-form a dilatation and curettage (D & C). This procedure
is done in the outpatient surgery department of a hospital
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1189Endometrial cancer

"and takes about an hour. The patient may be given general
anesthesia. The doctor dilates the cervix and uses a spe-cial instrument to scrape tissue from inside the uterus.
The tissue that is obtained from the biopsy or the D &
C is sent to a laboratory for examination. If cancer is found,then the type of cancer will be determined. The treatmentand prognosis depends on the type and stage of the cancer.
Trans-vaginal ultrasound may be used to measure the
thickness of the endometrium. For this painless procedure,a wand-like ultrasound transducer is inserted into the vagi-na to enable visualization and measurement of the uterus,the thickness of the uterine lining, and other pelvic organs.
Other possible diagnostic procedures include sono-
hysterography and hysteroscopy . For sonohysteroscopy,"
"hysterography and hysteroscopy . For sonohysteroscopy,
a small tube is passed through the cervix and into theuterus. A small amount of a salt water (saline) solution isinjected through the tube to open the space within theuterus and allow ultrasound visualization of theendometrium. For hysteroscopy, a wand-like camera ispassed through the cervix to allow direct visualization ofthe endometrium. Both of these procedures cause dis-comfort, which may be reduced by taking an anti-inflam-matory medication prior to the procedure.

endometrial cancer. The stage of cancer is determined after
surgery. Endometrial cancer is categorized into four stages(I, II, III, and IV) that are subdivided (A, B, and possibly C)based on the depth or spread of cancerous tissue. Seventypercent of all uterine cancers are stage I, 10–15% are stageII, and the remainder are stages III and IV . The cancer isalso graded (G1, G2, and G3) based upon microscopicanalysis of the aggressiveness of the cancer cells.
The FIGO stages for endometrial cancer are:
• Stage I. Cancer is limited to the uterus.
• Stage II. Cancer involves the uterus and cervix.
• Stage III. Cancer has spread out of the uterus but is
restricted to the pelvic region.
• Stage IV . Cancer has spread to the bladder, bowel, or
other distant locations."
"• Stage IV . Cancer has spread to the bladder, bowel, or
other distant locations.
The mainstay of treatment for most stages of
endometrial cancer is surgery. Radiation therapy , hor-
monal therapy, and chemotherapy are additional treat-
ments (called adjuvant therapy). The necessity of adju-vant therapy is a controversial topic which should be dis-cussed with the patient’s treatment team.
Surgery
Most women with endometrial cancer, except those
with stage IV disease, are treated with a hysterectomy . A
simple hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus.In a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with total hys-
terectomy, the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus are

"removed. This may be necessary because endometrial
cancer often spreads to the ovaries first. The lymph nodesin the pelvic region may also be biopsied or removed tocheck for metastasis. Hysterectomy is traditionally per-formed through an incision in the abdomen (laparotomy),however, endoscopic surgery ( laparoscopy ) with vaginal
hysterectomy is also being used. Women with stage I dis-ease may require no further treatment. However, thosewith higher grade disease will receive adjuvant therapy.
Radiation therapy
The decision to use radiation therapy depends on the
stage of the disease. Radiation therapy may be usedbefore surgery (preoperatively) and/or after surgery(postoperatively). Radiation given from a machine that isoutside the body is called external radiation therapy.Sometimes applicators containing radioactive com-pounds are placed inside the vagina or uterus. This iscalled internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy andrequires hospitalization."
"Side effects are common with radiation therapy. The
skin in the treated area may become red and dry.Fatigue , upset stomach, diarrhea , and nausea are also
common complaints. Radiation therapy in the pelvic areamay cause the vagina to become narrow (vaginal steno-sis), making intercourse painful. Premature menopause
and some problems with urination may also occur.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is usually reserved for women with
stage IV or recurrent disease because this therapy is not avery effective treatment for endometrial cancer. Theanticancer drugs are given by mouth or intravenously.
Side effects include stomach upset, vomiting, appetiteloss, hair loss, mouth or vaginal sores, fatigue, menstrualcycle changes, and premature menopause. There is alsoan increased chance of infections.

"Hormonal therapy
Hormonal therapy uses drugs like progesterone to
slow the growth of endometrial cells. These drugs areusually available as pills. This therapy is usually reservedfor women with advanced or recurrent disease. Sideeffects include fatigue, fluid retention, and appetite andweight changes.
Alternative treatment
Although alternative and complementary therapies are
used by many cancer patients, very few controlled studieson the effectiveness of such therapies exist. Mind-bodytechniques, such as prayer, biofeedback , visualization,
meditation , and yoga , have not shown any effect in reduc-ing cancer, but they can reduce stress and lessen some of"
"the side effects of cancer treatments. Clinical studies ofhydrazine sulfate found that it had no effect on cancer andeven worsened the health and well-being of the study sub-jects. One clinical study of the drug amygdalin (Laetrile)found that it had no effect on cancer. Laetrile can be toxicand has caused deaths. Shark cartilage, although highlytouted as an effective cancer treatment, is an improbabletherapy that has not been the subject of clinical study.
The American Cancer Society has found that the
“metabolic diets” pose serious risk to the patient. Theeffectiveness of the macrobiotic, Gerson, and Kelley diets
and the Manner metabolic therapy has not been scientifi-cally proven. The FDA was unable to substantiate the anti-cancer claims made about the popular Cancell treatment.

"There is no evidence for the effectiveness of most
over-the-counter herbal cancer remedies. Some herbalshave shown an anticancer effect. As shown in clinicalstudies, Polysaccharide krestin, from the mushroomCoriolus versicolor , has significant effectiveness against
cancer. In a small study, the green alga Chlorella
pyrenoidosa has been shown to have anticancer activity.
In a few small studies, evening primrose oil has shownsome benefit in the treatment of cancer.
Prognosis
Because it is possible to detect endometrial cancer
early, the chances of curing it are excellent. The five yearsurvival rates for endometrial cancer by stage are: 90%,stage I; 60%, stage II; 40%, stage III; and 5%, stage IV .Endometrial cancer most often spreads to the lungs, liver,bones, brain, vagina, and certain lymph nodes.

"Prevention
Women (especially postmenopausal women) should
report any abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge to thedoctor. Controlling obesity, blood pressure, and diabetescan help to reduce the risk of this disease. Women onestrogen replacement therapy have a substantiallyreduced risk of endometrial cancer if progestins are takensimultaneously. Long term use of birth control pills hasbeen shown to reduce the risk of this cancer. Women whohave irregular periods may be prescribed birth controlpills to help prevent endometrial cancer. Women who aretaking tamoxifen and those who carry the hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer gene should be screened reg-ularly, receiving annual pelvic examinations.

Endometriosis
Definition
Endometriosis is a condition in which bits of the tis-
sue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) growin other parts of the body. Like the uterine lining, this tis-sue builds up and sheds in response to monthly hormonalcycles. However, there is no natural outlet for the blooddiscarded from these implants. Instead, it falls onto sur-rounding organs, causing swelling and inflammation. Thisrepeated irritation leads to the development of scar tissueand adhesions in the area of the endometrial implants.
Description
Endometriosis is estimated to affect 7% of women of
childbearing age in the United States. It most commonlystrikes between the ages of 25 and 40. Endometriosis canalso appear in the teen years, but never before the start ofmenstruation. It is seldom seen in postmenopausalwomen."
"Endometriosis was once called the “career woman’s
disease” because it was thought to be a product ofdelayed childbearing. The statistics defy such a narrowgeneralization; however, pregnancy may slow the
progress of the condition. A more important predictor ofa woman’s risk is if her female relatives have endome-triosis. Another influencing factor is the length of awoman’s menstrual cycle. Women whose periods lastlonger than a week with an interval of less than 27 daysbetween them seem to be more prone to the condition.
Endometrial implants are most often found on the
pelvic organs—the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and inthe cavity behind the uterus. Occasionally, this tissuegrows in such distant parts of the body as the lungs, arms,and kidneys. Newly formed implants appear as smallbumps on the surfaces of the organs and supporting liga-ments and are sometimes said to look like “powder burns.”Ovarian cysts may form around endometrial tissue"
"(endometriomas) and may range from pea to grapefruitsize. Endometriosis is a progressive condition that usuallyadvances slowly, over the course of many years. Doctorsrank cases from minimal to severe based on factors such asthe number and size of the endometrial implants, theirappearance and location, and the extent of the scar tissueand adhesions in the vicinity of the growths.
Causes and symptoms
Although the exact cause of endometriosis is
unknown, a number of theories have been put forward.Some of the more popular ones are:
• Implantation theory. Originally proposed in the 1920s,
this theory states that a reversal in the direction of men-strual flow sends discarded endometrial cells into thebody cavity where they attach to internal organs andseed endometrial implants. There is considerable evi-dence to support this explanation. Reversed menstrual
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1192EndometriosisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1192"
"flow occurs in 70–90% of women and is thought to be
more common in women with endometriosis. However,many women with reversed menstrual flow do notdevelop endometriosis.
• Vascular-lymphatic theory. This theory suggests that
the lymph system or blood vessels (vascular system) isthe vehicle for the distribution of endometrial cells outof the uterus.
• Coelomic metaplasia theory. According to this hypothe-
sis, remnants of tissue left over from prenatal develop-ment of the woman’s reproductive tract transforms intoendometrial cells throughout the body.
• Induction theory. This explanation postulates that an
unidentified substance found in the body forces cellsfrom the lining of the body cavity to change intoendometrial cells.
In addition to these theories, the following factors are
thought to influence the development of endometriosis:
• Heredity. A woman’s chance of developing endometrio-
sis is seven times greater if her mother or sisters havethe disease."
"sis is seven times greater if her mother or sisters havethe disease.
• Immune system function. Women with endometriosis
may have lower functioning immune systems that havetrouble eliminating stray endometrial cells. This wouldexplain why a high percentage of women experiencereversed menstrual flow while relatively few developendometriosis.
• Dioxin exposure. Some research suggests a link
between the exposure to dioxin (TCCD), a toxic chemi-cal found in weed killers, and the development ofendometriosis.
While many women with endometriosis suffer debil-
itating symptoms, others have the disease without know-ing it. Paradoxically, there does not seem to be any rela-tion between the severity of the symptoms and the extentof the disease. The most common symptoms are:
• Menstrual pain . Pain in the lower abdomen that begins"
"• Menstrual pain . Pain in the lower abdomen that begins
a day or two before the menstrual period starts and con-tinues through to the end is typical of endometriosis.Some women also report lower back aches and painduring urination and bowel movement, especially dur-ing their periods.
• Painful sexual intercourse. Pressure on the vagina and
cervix causes severe pain for some women.
• Abnormal bleeding. Heavy menstrual periods, irregular
bleeding, and spotting are common features ofendometriosis.
•Infertility . There is a strong association between
endometriosis and infertility, although the reasons forthis have not been fully explained. It is thought thatthe build up of scar tissue and adhesions blocks the
fallopian tubes and prevents the ovaries from releasingeggs. Endometriosis may also affect fertility by caus-ing hormonal irregularities and a higher rate of earlymiscarriage .

"Diagnosis
If a doctor suspects endometriosis, the first step will
be to perform a pelvic exam to try to feel if implants are
present. Very often there is no strong evidence ofendometriosis from a physical exam. The only way tomake a definitive diagnosis is through minor surgerycalled a laparoscopy . A laparoscope, a slender scope with
a light on the end, is inserted into the woman’s abdomenthrough a small incision near her belly button. This allowsthe doctor to examine the internal organs for endometrioticgrowths. Often, a sample of tissue is taken for later exami-nation in the laboratory. Endometriosis is sometimes dis-covered when a woman has abdominal surgery for anotherreason such as tubal ligation or hysterectomy .

computed tomography scan (CT scan), or magnetic res-
onance imaging (MRI) can offer additional information"
"onance imaging (MRI) can offer additional information
but aren’t useful in making the initial diagnosis. A bloodtest may also be ordered because women withendometriosis have higher levels of the blood proteinCA125.

"Treatment
How endometriosis is treated depends on the
woman’s symptoms, her age, the extent of the disease,and her personal preferences. The condition cannot befully eradicated without surgery. Conservative treatmentfocuses on managing the pain, preserving fertility, anddelaying the progress of the condition.
Pain relief
Over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin
and acetaminophen (Tylenol) are useful for mild
cramping and menstrual pain. Prescription-strengthand over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)
and naproxen (Naprosyn), are also effective. If pain issevere, a doctor may prescribe narcotic medications,although these can be addicting and are rarely used.
Hormonal treatments
Hormonal therapies effectively tame endometriosis
but also act as contraceptives. A woman who is hoping tobecome pregnant would take these medications for aperiod of time, then try to conceive within severalmonths of discontinuing treatment."
"• Oral contraceptives. Continuously taking estrogen-
progestin pills tricks the body into thinking it is preg-nant. This state of pseudopregnancy means reducedpelvic pain and a temporary withering of endometrialimplants.
• Danazol (Danocrine) and gestrinone are synthetic male
hormones that lower estrogen levels, prevent menstrua-tion, and shrink endometrial tissues. On the downside,they lead to weight gain and menopause-like symp-toms, and cause some women to develop masculinecharacteristics.
• Progestins. Medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera) and
related drugs may also be used in treating endometrio-sis. They have been proven effective in minimizing painand halting the progress of the condition, but are rarelyused because of the high rate of side effects.
• Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnHR) agonists.
These estrogen-inhibiting drugs successfully limit painand prevent the growth of endometrial implants. Theycan cause menopause symptoms, however, and doses"
"have to be regulated to prevent bone loss associatedwith low estrogen levels.
Surgery
Removing the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes is
the only permanent method of eliminating endometrio-sis. This is an extreme measure that deprives a woman ofher ability to bear children and forces her body into
menopause. Endometrial implants and ovarian cysts canbe removed with laser surgery performed through a
laparoscope. For women with minimal endometriosis,this technique is usually successful in reducing pain andslowing the condition’s progress. It may also help infer-tile women increase their chances of becoming pregnant.
Alternative treatment
Although severe endometriosis should not be self-
treated, many women find they can help their conditionthrough alternative therapies. Taking vitamin B complexcombined with vitamins C, E, and the minerals calcium,"
"magnesium, and selenium can help the depression andlack of energy that may accompany endometriosis. B vit-amins also counteract the side effects of hormonal drugs.Other women have found relief when they turned to amacrobiotic diet. Less extreme diets that cut out sugar,
salt, and processed foods are sometimes helpful as well.Mind-body therapies such as relaxation and visualizationhelp women cope with pain. Other avenues to combatpain include acupuncture and biofeedback techniques.
Still other women report positive results after being treat-ed by chiropractors or homeopathic doctors.

"Prognosis
Most women who have endometriosis have minimal
symptoms and do well. Overall, endometriosis symp-toms come back in an average of 40% of women over thefive years following treatment. With hormonal therapy,pain returned after five years in 37% of patients withminimal symptoms and 74% of those with severe cases.The highest success rate from conservative treatment fol-lowed complete removal of implants using laser surgery.Eighty percent of these women were still pain-free fiveyears later. In cases that don’t respond to these treat-ments, a woman and her doctor may consider surgery toremove her reproductive organs.
Prevention
There is no proven way to prevent endometriosis.
One study, however, indicated that girls who begin par-ticipating in aerobic exercise at a young age are less like-
ly to develop the condition.

Precautions
Normal precautions should be taken with any diag-
nostic procedure. Since the population in which this pro-cedure is normally done is elderly, the imaging staffshould be extra cautious about stressing the patient. Theprocedure is invasive and may be embarrassing to some.Other patients may be anxious about their medical condi-tion since endorectal ultrasounds are not routine. Thisplaces an added burden on already stressed hearts andnervous systems. Physicians, nurses, and techniciansmay need to be prepared for stress reactions that could
include the heart, asthma , or anxious behaviors.

"Description
ERUS has been used as a means to determine the
depth of rectal cancers and to assess whether the tumorhas affected surrounding tissues. This pre-treatment pro-cedure has proven to be an accurate tool for tailoringsurgery for patients.
Problems with interpretation of the sonograms after
radiation and before surgery have resulted in tumorsbeing identified that were merely the formation offibrous tissues that remained after the tumors had beeneliminated by the radiation. Yet, some of the fibrousareas actually hid residual tumors. Rectal anatomy itselfcan affect the accuracy of ultrasound reading. Thismakes ERUS problematic in determining the amount oftumor reduction a patient has after radiation therapy .
Preparation
The patient must evacuate the bowels completely
before the procedure is done. This usually is assistedthough the use of several enemas . The patient may be"
"told to adhere to a liquid diet the day prior to doing thisprocedure. The probe is inserted, usually with little dis-comfort for the patient since it will only be examiningthe first few inches of the colon.

"Aftercare
Since ERUS is a minor invasive procedure, there is
no aftercare.
Risks
There are no risks to having an ultrasound.
Normal results
Normal results after an endorectal ultrasound are
normal, healthy tissues.
Abnormal results
Abnormal results range from any number of congen-
ital deformities in the lining of the rectum to serious rec-tal cancers.

Endoscopic retrograde

Definition
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography"
"cholangiopancreatography
Definition
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP) is a technique in which a hollow tube called anendoscope is passed through the mouth and stomach tothe duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). Thisprocedure was developed to examine abnormalities ofthe bile ducts, pancreas, and gallbladder. It was devel-oped during the late 1960s and is used today to diagnoseand treat blockages of the bile and pancreatic ducts.
The term has three parts to its definition:
• endoscopic refers to the use of an endoscope• retrograde refers to the injection of dye up into the bile
ducts in a direction opposing, or against, the normalflow of bile down the ducts
• cholangiopancreatography means visualization of the
bile ducts (cholangio) and pancreas (pancreato)

"Purpose
Until the 1970s, methods to visualize the bile ducts
produced images that were of relatively poor quality andoften misleading; in addition, the pancreatic duct couldnot be examined at all. Patients with symptoms related tothe bile ducts or pancreatic ducts frequently neededsurgery to diagnose and treat their conditions.
Using ERCP, physicians can obtain high-quality x
rays of these structures and identify areas of narrowing(strictures), cancers, and gallstones . This procedure can
help determine whether bile or pancreatic ducts areblocked; it also identifies where they are blocked alongwith the cause of the blockage. ERCP may then be usedto relieve the blockage. For patients requiring surgery oradditional procedures for treatment, ERCP outlines theanatomical changes for the surgeon.

"should seek physicians with experience performing
ERCP. Patients should inform the physician about anyallergies (including allergies to contrast dyes, iodine, or
shellfish), medication use, and medical problems. Occa-sionally, patients may need to be admitted to the hospitalafter the procedure.
Description
After sedation , a specially adapted endoscope is
passed through the mouth, through the stomach, then intothe duodenum. The opening to ducts that empty from theliver and pancreas is identified, and a plastic tube orcatheter is placed into the orifice (opening). Contrast dyeis then injected into the ducts, and with the assistance ofa radiologist, pictures are taken.
Preparation
The upper intestinal tract must be empty for the pro-
cedure, so patients should not eat or drink for at least six to12 hours before the exam. Patients should ask the physi-cian about taking their medications before the procedure.

"Aftercare
Someone should be available to take the person
home after the procedure and stay with them for a while;patients will not be able to drive themselves because theyundergo sedation during this test. Pain or any other
unusual symptoms should be reported to the physician.
Risks
ERCP-related complications can be broken down
into those related to medications used during the proce-dure, the diagnostic part of the procedure, and thoserelated to endoscopic therapy. The overall complicationrate is 5–10%; most of those occur when diagnosticERCP is combined with a therapeutic procedure. Duringthe exam, the endoscopist can cut or stretch structures(such as the muscle leading to the bile duct) to treat thecause of the patient’s symptoms. Although the use ofsedatives carries a risk of decreasing cardiac and respira-tory function, it is very difficult to perform these proce-dures without these drugs.

"Abnormal results
When areas in the pancreatic or bile ducts (including
those in the liver) are too wide or too narrow comparedwith the standard, the test is considered abnormal. Oncethese findings are demonstrated using ERCP, symptomsare usually present; they generally do not change withouttreatment. Stones, identified as opaque or solid structureswithin the ducts, are also considered abnormal. Massesor tumors may also be seen, but sometimes the diagnosisis made not by direct visualization of the tumor, but byindirect signs, such as a single narrowing of one of theducts. Overall, ERCP has an excellent record in diagnos-ing these abnormalities.

Endoscopic sphincterotomy
Definition
Endoscopic sphincterotomy or endoscopic retrograde
sphincterotomy (ERS) is a relatively new endoscopictechnique developed to examine and treat abnormalitiesof the bile ducts, pancreas and gallbladder. The procedurewas developed as an extension to the diagnostic examina-tion, ERCP ( endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancre-
atography ); with the addition of “sphincterotomy,”"
"atography ); with the addition of “sphincterotomy,”
abnormalities found during the study could be treated atthe same time without the need for invasive surgery.
The term ERS has three parts to its definition;
• endoscopic refers to the use of an endoscope
• retrograde refers to the insertion of the endoscope up
into the ducts in a direction opposite to or against thenormal flow of bile down the ducts
• sphincterotomy, which means cutting of the sphincter

"Purpose
Until the 1970s, patients with symptoms related to
disease of the bile ducts or pancreas frequently neededsurgery to diagnose the cause and treat any abnormali-ties. ERCP allowed physicians for the first time to obtainhigh quality x rays of the common bile and pancreaticducts, and detect areas of narrowing (strictures), stones,and tumors. ERCP was not initially designed for treat-ment. ERS was developed shortly after and enabledphysicians to treat the abnormalities identified by theinjection of dye and x rays.The revolutionary technique made possible the
endoscopic removal of stones and stretching of areas ofnarrowing (strictures). It has since been expanded toinclude drainage of bile from blocked ducts and treat-ment of various abnormalities of the pancreas.

"Precautions
The most important precaution related to both ERCP
and ERS is to have the procedure performed by an expe-rienced physician. ERS is technically more difficult thanmany other gastrointestinal endoscopic studies, includingERCP. Patients should inquire as to the physician’s expe-rience with the procedure. The physician should also beinformed of any allergies , medication use, and medical
problems.
Description
ERS is generally performed only after ERCP has
been successfully accomplished and detail of the anato-my and abnormalities is known. During ERS, a numberof various instruments are inserted through the endo-scope in order to “cut” or stretch the sphincter. Once thisis done, additional instruments are passed that enable theremoval of stones and the stretching of narrowed regionsof the ducts. Drains (stents) can also be used to prevent anarrowed area from rapidly returning to its previouslynarrowed state.

"Preparation
The upper intestinal tract must be empty for the pro-
cedure, so patients must not eat or drink for at least six to12 hours before the exam. Patients need to inquire abouttaking their medications before the procedure. Somepatients may require antibiotics before and/or after the
procedure. When possible, aspirin or NSAIDS should
not be taken within several days before the procedure,because they interfere with blood clotting.
Aftercare
When ERS is performed, physicians will usually
want to observe the patient closely for several hours toensure that there are no signs of complications. Pain or
any other unusual symptoms should be reported. Admis-sion to the hospital may be advised.
Risks

used during the procedure, or the results of dye injectionor cutting of tissue. The overall complication rate is5–10%. During the exam, the endoscopist can cut or"

"stretch structures (such as the muscle leading to the bile
duct) to treat the cause of the patient’s symptoms. Cut-ting or stretching of these structures can sometimes causea hole or perforation. The use of sedatives also carries arisk of decreasing cardiac and respiratory function, how-ever, it is very difficult to perform these procedures with-out these drugs.
Other major complications related to ERCP or ERS
are pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and
cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Bacteremia
(the passage of bacteria into the blood stream) and bleed-ing are also risks.
Normal results
Certain standards have been set for the diameter or
width of the pancreatic and bile ducts. Measurements byx ray are used to determine if the ducts are too large(dilated) or too narrow (strictured). Lastly, the ducts andgallbladder should be free of any solid particles, such asstones, and free of areas of narrowing.

Purpose
Enemas may be given for the following purposes:
• to remove feces when an individual is constipated or
impacted,
• to remove feces and cleanse the rectum in preparation
for an examination,
• to remove feces prior to a surgical procedure to prevent
contamination of the surgical area,
• to administer drugs or anesthetic agents.

"water enemas can cause cardiovascular overload and
electrolyte imbalance. Similarly, repeated saline enemascan cause increased absorption of fluid and electrolytesinto the bloodstream, resulting in overload. Individualsreceiving frequent enemas should be observed for over-load symptoms that include dizziness , sweating, or
vomiting.
Soap suds and saline used for cleansing enemas can
cause irritation of the lining of the bowel, with repeateduse or a solution that is too strong. Only white soapshould be used; the bar should not have been previouslyused, to prevent infusing undesirable organisms into theindividual receiving the enema. Common householddetergents are considered too strong for the rectum andbowel. The commercially prepared castile soap is pre-ferred, and should be used in concentration no greaterthan 5 cc soap to 1,000 cc of water.

"Description
Cleansing enemas act by stimulation of bowel activ-
ity through irritation of the lower bowel, and by disten-tion with the volume of fluid instilled. When the enemais administered, the individual is usually lying on the leftside, which places the sigmoid colon (lower portion ofbowel) below the rectum and facilitates infusion of fluid.The length of time it takes to administer an enemadepends on the amount of fluid to be infused. Theamount of fluid administered will vary depending on theage and size of the person receiving the enema, however
general guidelines would be:
• Infant: 250 cc or less
• Toddler and preschooler: 500 cc or less
• School-aged child: 500–1,000 cc• Adult: 750–1,000 cc

"Some may differentiate between high and low ene-
mas. A high enema, given to cleanse as much of the largebowel as possible, is usually administered at higher pres-sure and with larger volume (1,000 cc), and the individ-ual changes position several times in order for the fluidto flow up into the bowel. A low enema, intended tocleanse only the lower bowel, is administered at lowerpressure, using about 500 cc of fluid.
Oil retention enemas serve to lubricate the rectum
and lower bowel, and soften the stool. For adults, about150–200 cc of oil is instilled, while in small children,75–150 cc of oil is considered adequate. Salad oil or liq-uid petrolatum are commonly used at a temperature of91°F (32.8°C). There are also commercially prepared oilretention enemas. The oil is usually retained for one tothree hours before it is expelled.
The rectal tube used for infusion of the solution,"
"The rectal tube used for infusion of the solution,
usually made of rubber or plastic, has two or moreopenings at the end through which the solution can flowinto the bowel. The distance to which the tube must beinserted is dependent upon the age and size of thepatient. For adult, insertion is usually 3–4 in (7.5–10cm); for children, approximately 2–3 in (5–7.5 cm); andfor infants, only 1–1.5 in (2.5–3.75 cm). The rectal tubeis lubricated before insertion with a water soluble lubri-cant to ease insertion and decrease irritation to the rec-tal tissues.
The higher the container of solution is placed, the
greater the force in which the fluid flows into the patient.Routinely, the container should be no higher than 12 in(30 cm) above the level of the bed; for a high cleansingenema, the container may be 12–18 in (30–45 cm) abovethe bed level, because the fluid is to be instilled higherinto the bowel.

Description"
"Description
The common term for enlarged prostate is BPH,
which stands for benign (non-cancerous) prostatichyperplasia or hypertrophy. Hyperplasia means that theprostate cells are dividing too rapidly, increasing thetotal number of cells, and, therefore, the size of theorgan itself. Hypertrophy simply means “enlargement.”BPH is part of the aging process. The actual changes in
the prostate may start as early as the 30s but take placevery gradually, so that significant enlargement andsymptoms usually do not appear until after age 50. Pastthis age the chances of the prostate enlarging and caus-ing urinary symptoms become progressively greater.More than 40% of men in their 70s have an enlargedprostate. Symptoms generally appear between ages55–75. About 10% of all men eventually will requiretreatment for BPH.
BPH has been viewed as a rare condition in African,
Chinese and other Asian peoples for reasons that are notclear.

"Causes and symptoms
The cause of BPH is a mystery, but age-related
changes in the levels of hormones circulating in theblood may be a factor. Whatever the cause, an enlargingprostate gradually narrows the urethra and obstructs theflow of urine. Even though the muscle in the bladder wallbecomes stronger in an attempt to push urine through thesmaller urethra, in time, the bladder fails to empty com-pletely at each urination. The urine that collects in thebladder can become infected and lead to stone formation.The kidneys themselves may be damaged by infection orby urine constantly “backing up.”
When the enlarging prostate gland narrows the ure-"
"When the enlarging prostate gland narrows the ure-
thra, a man will have increasing trouble starting the urinestream. Because some urine remains behind in the blad-der, he will have to urinate more often, perhaps two orthree times at night (nocturia). The need to urinate canbecome very urgent and, in time, urine may dribble outto stain a man’s clothing. Other symptoms of BPH are aweak and sometimes a split stream and general aching orpain in the perineum (the area between the scrotum and
anus). Some men may have considerable enlargement ofthe prostate before even mild symptoms develop.
If a man must strain hard to force out the urine,
small veins in the bladder wall and urethra may rupture,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1201Enlarged prostateGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1201"
"causing blood to appear in the urine. If the urinary stream
becomes totally blocked, the urine collecting in the blad-der may cause severe discomfort, a condition calledacute urinary retention. Urine that stagnates in the blad-der can easily become infected. A burning feeling duringurination and fever are clues that infection may have
developed. Finally, if urine backs up long enough it mayincrease pressure in the kidneys, though this rarely caus-es permanent kidney damage.
Diagnosis
When a man’s symptoms point to BPH, the first
thing the physician will want to do is a digital rectal
examination , inserting a finger into the anus to feel
whether—and how much—the prostate is enlarged. Asmooth prostate surface suggests BPH, whereas a dis-tinct lump in the gland might mean prostate cancer .
The next step is a blood test for a substance calledprostate-specific antigen or PSA. Between 30–50% ofmen with BPH have an elevated PSA level. This doesnot mean cancer by any means, but other measures"
"are needed to make sure that the prostate enlargementis in fact benign. An ultrasound exam of the prostate,which is entirely safe and delivers no radiation, canshow whether it is enlarged and may show that canceris present.If digital or ultrasound examination of the prostate
raises the suspicion of cancer, most urologists will rec-ommend that a prostatic tissue biopsy be performed. Thisis usually done using a lance-like instrument that isinserted into the rectum. It pierces the rectal wall and,guided by the physcian’s finger, obtains six to eightpieces of prostatic tissue that are sent to the laboratoryfor microscopic examination. If cancer is present, theprognosis and treatment are changed accordingly.
A catheter placed through the urethra and into the"
"A catheter placed through the urethra and into the
bladder can show how much urine remains in the bladderafter the patient urinates—a measure of how severe theobstruction is. Another and very simple test for obstruc-tion is to have the man urinate into a uroflowmeter,which measures the rate of urine flow. A very certain—though invasive—way of confirming obstruction from anenlarged prostate is to pass a special viewing instrumentcalled a cystoscope into the bladder, but this is not oftennecessary.
It is routine to check a urine sample for an increased
number of white blood cells, which may mean there isinfection of the bladder or kidneys. The same samplemay be cultured to show what type of bacterium is caus-ing the infection, and which antibiotics will work best.
The state of the kidneys may be checked in two ways:imaging by either ultrasound or injecting a dye (the intra-

Treatment
Drugs
A class of drugs called alpha-adrenergic blockers,
which includes phenoxybenzamine and doxazosin, relaxthe muscle tissue surrounding the bladder outlet and lin-ing the wall of the urethra to permit urine to flow morefreely. These drugs improve obstructive symptoms, but donot keep the prostate from enlarging. Other drugs (finas-teride is a good example) do shrink the prostate and maydelay the need for surgery. Symptoms may not, however,improve until the drug has been used for three months orlonger. Antibiotic drugs are given promptly wheneverinfection is diagnosed. Some medications, including anti-
histamines and some decongestants , can make the
symptoms of BPH suddenly worse and even cause acuteurinary retention, and therefore should be avoided.

"Intermediate treatments
When drugs have failed to control symptoms of
BPH but the physician does not believe that conventionalsurgery is yet needed, a procedure called transurethralneedle ablation may be tried. In the office and using localanesthesia, a needle is inserted into the prostate andradiofrequency energy is applied to destroy the tissuethat is obstructing urine flow. Another new approach ismicrowave hyperthermia, using a device called theProstatron to deliver microwave energy to the prostatethrough a catheter. This procedure is done at an outpa-tient surgery center.

"Surgery
For many years the standard operation for BPH has
been transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate. Undergeneral or spinal anesthesia, a cystoscope is passedthrough the urethra and prostate tissue surrounding theurethra is removed using either a cutting instrument or aheated wire loop. The small pieces of prostate tissue arewashed out through the scope. No incision is needed forTUR. There normally is some blood in the urine for afew days following the procedure. In a few men—lessthan 5% of all those having TUR—urine will continue toescape unintentionally. Other uncommon complicationsinclude a temporary rise in blood pressure with mentalconfusion, which is treated by giving salt solution. Impo-tence—the inability to achieve lasting penile erections—does occur, but probably in fewer than 10% of patients. Anarrowing or stricture rarely develops in the urethra, butthis can be treated fairly easily.KEY TERMS

than standard TUR, an incision is made through theprostate to open up the part of the urethra passingthrough it. This may work well in men whose prostateis not grossly enlarged.
• Transurethral vaporization. A small roller ball is used to
break up and vaporize the obstructing prostatic tissue,rather than cutting it away as in standard TUR. This isequally successful but patients usually can leave thehospital within 24 hours, and there is less blood loss.

"Prognosis
In a man without symptoms whose prostate is
enlarged, it is hard to predict when urinary symptomswill develop and how rapidly they will progress. For thisreasons some specialists (urologists) advise a period of“watchful waiting.” When BPH is treated by convention-al TUR, there is a small risk of complications but, in thegreat majority of men, urinary symptoms will be relievedand their quality of life will be much enhanced. In thefuture, it is possible that the less invasive forms of surgi-cal treatment will be increasingly used to achieve resultsas good as those of the standard operation. It also is pos-sible that new medications will be developed that shrinkthe prostate and eliminate obstructive symptoms so thatsurgery can be avoided altogether.

"Prevention
Whether or not BPH is caused by hormonal changes
in aging men, there is no known way of preventing it.Once it does develop and symptoms are present thatinterfere seriously with the patient’s life, timely medicalor surgical treatment will reliably prevent symptomsfrom getting worse. Also, if the condition is treatedbefore the prostate has become grossly enlarged, the riskof complications is minimal. One of the potentially mostserious complications of BPH, urinary infection (andpossible infection of the kidneys), can be prevented byusing a catheter to drain excess urine out of the bladderso that it does not collect, stagnate, and become infected.

Enterobacterial infections
Definition
Enterobacterial infections are disorders of the diges-
tive tract and other organ systems produced by a group ofgram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria called Enterobacteri-aceae. Gram-negative means that the organisms do notretain the violet color of the dye used to make Gramstains. The most troublesome organism in this group isEscherichia coli . Other enterobacteria are species of Sal-
monella ,Shigella ,Klebsiella ,Enterobacter ,Serratia ,
Proteus , and Yersinia .

Description
Enterobacterial infections can be produced by bacte-
ria that normally live in the human digestive tract withoutcausing serious disease, or by bacteria that enter from theoutside. In many cases these infections are nosocomial,which means that they can be acquired in the hospital.Klebsiella and Proteus sometimes cause pneumonia , ear
and sinus infections, and urinary tract infections. Enter-
obacter and Serratia often cause bacterial infection of
the blood ( bacteremia ), particularly in patients with
weakened immune systems.
Diarrhea caused by enterobacteria is a common"
"weakened immune systems.
Diarrhea caused by enterobacteria is a common
problem in the United States. It is estimated that eachperson in the general population has an average of 1.5episodes of diarrhea each year, with higher rates in chil-dren, institutionalized people, and Native Americans.This type of enterobacterial infection can range from aminor nuisance to a life-threatening disorder, especiallyin infants, elderly persons, AIDS patients, and malnour-
ished people. Enterobacterial infections are one of thetwo leading killers of children in developing countries.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
Enterobacterial infections in the digestive tract typi-
cally start when the organisms invade the mucous tissuesthat line the digestive tract. They may be bacteria that are
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1204Enterobacterial infectionsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1204"
"already present in the stomach and intestines, or they
may be transmitted by contaminated food and water. It isalso possible for enterobacterial infections to spread byperson-to-person contact. The usual incubation period is12–72 hours.
ESCHERICHIA COLI INFECTIONS. E. coli infections
cause most of the enterobacterial infections in the UnitedStates. The organisms are categorized according towhether they are invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasivetypes of E. coli include what are called enteropathogenic
E. coli , or EPEC, and enterotoxigenic E. coli , or ETEC.
EPEC and ETEC types produce a bacterial poison (toxin)in the stomach that interacts with the digestive juices andcauses the patient to lose large amounts of water throughthe intestines.
The invasive types of E. coli are called enterohemor-
rhagic E. coli , or EHEC, and enteroinvasive E. coli, or"
"rhagic E. coli , or EHEC, and enteroinvasive E. coli, or
EIEC. These subtypes invade the stomach tissues direct-ly, causing tissue destruction and bloody stools. EHECcan produce complications leading to hemolytic-uremic
syndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal disorder marked by
the destruction of red blood cells and kidney failure.EHEC has become a growing problem in the UnitedStates because of outbreaks caused by contaminatedfood. A particular type of EHEC known as O157:H7 hasbeen identified since 1982 in undercooked hamburgers,unpasteurized milk, and apple juice. Between 2–7% ofinfections caused by O157:H7 develop into HUS.
Symptoms
The symptoms of enterobacterial infections are
sometimes classified according to the type of diarrheathey produce.
WATERY DIARRHEA. Patients infected with ETEC,
EPEC, some types of Salmonella , and some types of
Shigella develop a watery diarrhea. These infections are"
"Shigella develop a watery diarrhea. These infections are
located in the small intestine, result from bacterial toxinsinteracting with digestive juices, do not produce inflamma-tion, and do not usually need treatment with antibiotics .
BLOODY DIARRHEA (DYSENTERY). Bloody diarrhea
is sometimes called dysentery. It is produced by EHEC,EIEC, some types of Salmonella , some types of Shigella ,
and Yersinia . In dysentery, the infection is located in the
colon, cells and tissues are destroyed, inflammation ispresent, and antibiotic therapy is usually required.
NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS (NEC). Necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC) is a disorder that begins in newborn
infants shortly after birth. Although NEC is not yet fullyunderstood, it is thought that it results from a bacterial orviral invasion of damaged intestinal tissues. The diseaseorganisms then cause the death (necrosis) of bowel tis-sue or gangrene of the bowel. NEC is primarily a disease"
"of prematurity ; 60–80% of cases occur in high-risk
preterm infants. NEC is responsible for 2–5% of cases innewborn intensive care units (NICU). Enterobacteriaceaethat have been identified in infants with NEC includeSalmonella ,E. coli ,Klebsiella , and Enterobacter .
Diagnosis
Patient history
The diagnosis of enterobacterial infections is com-
plicated by the fact that viruses, protozoa, and othertypes of bacteria can also cause diarrhea. In most casesof mild diarrhea, it is not critical to identify the organismbecause the disorder is self-limiting. Some groups ofpatients, however, should have stool tests. They include:
• patients with bloody diarrhea,• patients with watery diarrhea who have become dehy-
drated,
• patients with watery diarrhea that has lasted longer than
three days without decreasing in amount,
• patients with disorders of the immune system.
The patient history is useful for public health reasons"
"The patient history is useful for public health reasons
as well as helping the doctor determine what type ofenterobacterium may be causing the infection. The doctorwill ask about the frequency and appearance of the diar-rhea as well as other digestive symptoms. If the patient isnauseated and vomiting, the infection is more likely to belocated in the small intestine. If the patient is running afever , a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. The doctor
will also ask if anyone else in the patient’s family orworkplace is sick. Some types of enterobacteriaceae aremore likely to cause group outbreaks than others. Otherquestions include the patient’s food intake over the lastfew days and whether he or she has recently traveled tocountries with typhoid fever or cholera outbreaks.

cause of diarrhea is the stool test. Examining a stool sam-ple under a microscope can help to rule out parasitic and

ETEC, EPEC, and EIECare unusual in the United States and can usually be iden-tified only by specialists in research laboratories.Because of concern about EHEC outbreaks, however,most laboratories in the United States can now screen forO157:H7 with a test that identifies its characteristictoxin. All patients with bloody diarrhea should have astool sample tested for E. coli O157:H7.
Treatment
The initial treatment of enterobacterial diarrhea is
usually empiric. Empiric means that the doctor treats thepatient on the basis of the visible symptoms and profes-sional experience in treating infections, without waitingfor laboratory test results. Since the results of stool cul-tures can take as long as two days, it is important to pre-vent dehydration. The patient will be given fluids torestore the electrolyte balance and paregoric to relieveabdominal cramping."
"Newborn infants and patients with immune system
disorders will be given antibiotics intravenously once theorganism has been identified. Gentamicin, tobramycin,and amikacin are being used more frequently to treatenterobacterial infections because many of the organismsare becoming resistant to ampicillin and cephalosporinantibiotics.
Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for diarrhea are intended to
relieve the discomfort of abdominal cramping. Mostalternative practitioners advise consulting a medical doc-tor if the patient has sunken eyes, dry eyes or mouth, orother signs of dehydration.
Herbal medicine
Herbalists may recommend cloves taken as an infu-
sion or ginger given in drop doses to control intestinalcramps, eliminate gas, and prevent vomiting. Peppermint(Mentha piperita ) or chamomile ( Matricaria recutita )
tea may also ease cramps and intestinal spasms.

The prognosis for most enterobacterial infections is
good; most patients recover in about a week or 10 dayswithout needing antibiotics. HUS, on the other hand, hasa mortality rate of 3–5% even with intensive care. Abouta third of the survivors have long-term problems withkidney function, and another 8% develop high bloodpressure, seizure disorders, and blindness.

Enterobiasis

Enterobiasis, or pinworm infection as it is common-

"common symptom of this irritating, but not particularlydangerous, disease is itching around the anal area.Description
Enterobiasis is also called seatworm infection or
oxyuriasis. In the United States, enterobiasis is the mostcommon worm infection, and some estimate that approx-imately 10% of the United States population is infected.Worldwide, approximately 200 million people are infect-ed. Enterobiasis can affect people of any age, but is mostcommon among children ages 5–14 and particularlyaffects those in the daycare setting.

female worm is about the size of a staple (approximately0.4 in [1 cm] long and 0.02 in [0.5 mm] wide) and has apointed tip. The disease is transmitted by ingesting theeggs of the pinworm. These eggs travel to the small intes-tine where, after approximately one month, they hatchand mature into adult worms. During the night, thefemale adult worms travel to the area around the anusand deposit eggs in the folds of the anal area. A singlefemale pinworm can lay 10,000 eggs and, after layingeggs, dies. The eggs are capable of causing infectionafter six hours at body temperature.

"ual can also become infected by inhaling and swallowing
the eggs, for example, when the bedcovers are shaken.
Many individuals with enterobiasis exhibit no symp-
toms. When present, however, symptoms of the infectionbegin approximately two weeks after ingesting the pin-worm eggs. The main symptom is itching around theanus. Because the itching intensifies at night, when thefemale worms comes to the anus to lay eggs, it oftenleads to disrupted sleep and irritability. Poor sleeping atnight in small children can be related to pinworms. Occa-sionally, the itching causes some bleeding and bruisingin the region, and secondary bacterial infections canoccur. In females, the itching may spread to the vaginaand sometimes causes an infection of the vaginal region(vaginitis). Enterobiasis usually lasts one to two months.

Treatment
In order to treat the disease, either mebendazole
(Vermox) or pyrantel pamoate (Pin-X) will be given intwo oral doses spaced two weeks apart. These medica-tions eradicate the infection in approximately 90% ofcases. Re-infection is common and several treatmentsmay be required. Because the infection is easily spreadthrough contact with contaminated clothing or surfaces,it is recommended that all family members receive thetherapeutic dose. Sometimes a series of six treatmentsare given, each spaced two weeks apart. If family mem-bers continue to be infected, a source outside the housemay be responsible.
To relieve the rectal itching, a shallow warm bath
with either half a cup of table salt, or Epsom salts is rec-ommended. Also, application of an ointment containingzinc oxide or regular petroleum jelly can be used torelieve rectal itching.

Prevention
The disease can be prevented by treating all the

• wash hands thoroughly before handling food and eating
• keep finger nails short and clean
• avoiding scratching the anal area
• take early morning showers to wash away eggs deposit-

• once the infection has been identified, and treatment is
started, change the bed linen, night clothes, and under-wear daily
• machine wash linens in hot water and dry with heat to
kill any eggs
• open the blinds or curtains since eggs are sensitive to

Enterostomy
Definition
An enterostomy is an operation in which the surgeon
makes a passage into the patient’s small intestine throughthe abdomen with an opening to allow for drainage or toinsert a tube for feeding. The opening is called a stoma,from the Greek word for mouth. Enterostomies may beeither temporary or permanent. They are classified accord-ing to the part of the intestine that is used to create thestoma. If the ileum, which is the lowest of the three sec-tions of the small intestine, is used to make the stoma, theoperation is called an ileostomy. If the jejunum, which isthe middle section of the small intestine, is used, the oper-ation is called a jejunostomy. Some people use the wordostomy as a word that covers all types of enterostomies.

"Purpose
Enterostomies are performed in order to create a
new opening for the passage of fecal matter when normalintestinal functioning is interrupted or when diseases ofthe intestines cannot be treated by medications or lessradical surgery. Some situations that may require entero-stomies include:
• Healing of inflamed bowel segments. Enterostomies
performed for this reason are usually temporary.
• Emergency treatment of gunshot or other penetrating
wounds of the abdomen. An enterostomy is needed to
prevent the contents of the intestine from causing a seri-ous inflammation of the inside of the abdominal cavity(peritonitis ). These enterostomies are also often tem-
porary.
• Placement of a tube for enteral feeding. Enteral feeding
is a method for conveying nutritional solutions directlyinto the stomach or jejunum through a tube. Tubeenterostomies may be long-term but are not permanent.
• Removal of diseased sections of the intestines."
"• Removal of diseased sections of the intestines.
Ileostomies performed for this reason are permanent.The most common disorders requiring permanentileostomy are Crohn’s disease ,familial polyposis , and
ulcerative colitis . Familial polyposis and ulcerative
colitis are serious health risks because they can developinto cancer .
• Treatment of advanced cancer or other causes of intesti-
nal obstruction.
Precautions
Enterostomies are usually performed only as emer-
gency treatments for traumatic injuries in the abdomen oras final measures for serious disorders of the intestines.Most patients do not refuse to have the operation per-formed when the need for it is explained to them. A smallminority, however, refuse enterostomies because ofstrong psychological reactions to personal disfigurementand the need to relearn bowel habits.
Description
Ileostomy
Ileostomies represent about 25% of enterostomies."
"They are performed after the surgeon removes a diseasedcolon and sometimes the rectum as well. The most com-mon ileostomy is called a Brooke ileostomy after theEnglish surgeon who developed it. In a Brooke ileosto-my, the surgeon makes the stoma in the lower right sec-tion of the abdomen. The ileum is pulled through anopening (incision) in the muscle layer. The surgeon thenturns the cut end of the intestine inside out and sews it tothe edges of the hole. He or she then positions an appli-ance for collecting the fecal material. The appliance con-sists of a plastic bag that fits over the stoma and lies flatagainst the abdomen. The patient is taught to drain thebag from time to time during the day. Ileostomies need tobe emptied frequently because the digested food containslarge amounts of water. Shortly after the operation, theileostomy produces 1–2 qt (0.9–1.91) of fluid per day;after a month or two of adjustment, the volume decreasesto 1–2 pt (0.5–0.9)per day."
"KOCK POUCH (CONTINENT ILEOSTOMY). The Kock
pouch is a variation of the basic ileostomy and is namedfor its Swedish inventor. In the Kock technique, the sur-geon forms a pouch inside the abdominal cavity behindthe stoma that collects the fecal material. The stoma isshaped into a valve to prevent fluid from leaking onto thepatient’s abdomen. The patient then empties the pouchseveral times daily by inserting a tube (catheter) throughthe valve. The Kock technique is sometimes called a con-tinent ileostomy because the fluid is contained inside theabdomen. It is successful in 70–90% of patients whohave it done.

"Jejunostomy
A jejunostomy is similar to an ileostomy except that
the stoma is placed in the second section of the smallintestine rather than the third. Jejunostomies are per-formed less frequently than ileostomies. They are almostalways temporary procedures.
Tube enterostomies
Tube enterostomies are operations in which the sur-

As long as the patient’sintestinal tract can function, tube feedings are consid-
ered preferable to intravenous feeding. Enteral nutrition

If the patient is going to have a permanent ileosto-

pain and diarrhea of ulcerative colitis or the risk of can-
cer from other intestinal disorders. The patient can alsomeet with an enterostomal therapist (ET) or a member ofthe United Ostomy Association, which is a support groupfor people with ostomies.
Medical preparation
The patient is prepared for surgery with an evalua-
tion of his or her nutritional status, possible need forblood transfusions, and antibiotics if necessary. If the

"Medical aftercare
If the enterostomy is temporary, aftercare consists of
the usual monitoring of surgical wounds for infection orbleeding. If the patient has had a permanent ileostomy,aftercare includes learning to use the appliance or emptythe Kock pouch; learning to keep the stoma clean; andreadjusting bathroom habits. Recovery takes a long timebecause major surgery is a shock to the system and the
intestines take several days to resume normal function-ing. The patient’s fluid intake and output will be checkedfrequently to minimize the risk of dehydration .
Patient education
Ileostomy patients must learn to watch their fluid and
salt intake. They are at greater risk of becoming dehydrat-ed in hot weather, from exercise , or from diarrhea. In
some cases they may need extra bananas or orange juicein the diet to keep up the level of potassium in the blood.

"Patient education includes social concerns as well as
physical self-care. Many ileostomy patients are worriedabout the effects of the operation on their close relationshipsand employment. If the patient has not seen an ET beforethe operation, the aftercare period is a good time to find outabout self-help and support groups. The ET can also evalu-ate the patient’s emotional reactions to the ostomy.
Risks
Enterostomies are not considered high-risk opera-
tions by themselves. About 40% of ileostomy patientshave complications afterward, however; about 15%require minor surgical corrections. Possible complica-tions include:

lapse)
Normal results
Normal results include recovery from the surgery
with few or no complications. About 95% of people withostomies recover completely, are able to return to work,and consider themselves to be in good health. Many
ileostomy patients enjoy being able to eat a full range offoods rather than living on a restricted diet. Somepatients, however, need to be referred to psychotherapiststo deal with depression or other emotional problems afterthe operation.

Enterovirus infections
Definition
Enteroviruses are so named because they reproduce
initially in the gastrointestinal tract after infection occurs.Despite, this, they usually do not lead to intestinal symp-toms; rather it is their spread to organs, such as the nervoussystem, heart, skin, and others that causes disease.Enteroviruses are part of a larger group of viruses known asPicornaviruses. The word comes from the combination of“pico” (Spanish, meaning “a little bit”), and RNA (ribonu-cleic acid, an important component of genetic material).
Description
There are four groups of enteroviruses: Coxsack-
ievirus, Echovirus, ungrouped Enterovirus, and YPoliovirus. 
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1211Enterovirus infectionsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1211"
"Viruses are generally divided into those that use
DNA (desoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA as their geneticmaterial; all enteroviruses are RNA viruses. They arefound worldwide, but infection is more common in areasof poor hygiene and overcrowding.
Although most cases of enterovirus do not produce
symptoms, some five to 10 million individuals in the Unit-ed States each year suffer from one of the enteroviral dis-eases. Illness is more common in the very young. Whilethere are close to seventy different strains of enteroviruses,over 70% of infections are caused by only 10 types.
The virus is most commonly transmitted by the
fecal-oral route (contamination of fingers or objects byhuman waste material); in some instances transmission isthrough contaminated food or water. Passage of somestrains of virus by way of air droplets can lead to respira-tory illness. Infection of fetuses by way of the placentahas also been documented. Breast milk contains antibod-ies which can protect newborns."
"The incubation period for most enteroviruses ranges
from two to 14 days. In areas of temperate climate, infec-tions occur mainly in the summer and fall.
Causes and symptoms
Enteroviruses are believed to be the cause of at least
10 distinct illnesses. Once they enter the body, they mul-tiply in the cells that line the gastrointestinal tract, andeventually reach sites of lymphatic tissue (such as thetonsils). While most of these diseases are of short dura-tion and do not cause significant injury, some can pro-duce severe illness.
The main syndromes caused by the various entero-
viruses are the following:
• Summer grippe (nonspecific febrile illness). This is the
most common syndrome, and is characterized by flu-like symptoms of fever ,headache , and weakness, that
typically last three to four days. Many patients alsodevelop upper respiratory symptoms and some nausea
and vomiting . One of the major ways to distinguish
this disease from influenza , is the fact that grippe most"
"this disease from influenza , is the fact that grippe most
often occurs in the summer.
• Generalized disease of the newborn is a potentially
serious infection in which infants from one week tothree months of age develop a syndrome that can bedifficult to distinguish from a severe bacterial infection.Fever, irritability, and decreased responsiveness orexcessive sleepiness are the major symptoms. Inflam-mation of heart muscle ( myocarditis ), low blood pres-
sure, hepatitis, and meningitis sometimes complicate
the illness.• Aseptic meningitis encephalitis is a well known syn-
drome caused by this group of viruses. In fact,enteroviruses are responsible for over 90% of cases ofaseptic meningitis, and most often hits children andyoung adults. Headache, fever, avoidance of light, andeye pain are characteristic. Drowsiness may be promi-
nent, and other symptoms include sore throat ,cough ,"
"nent, and other symptoms include sore throat ,cough ,
muscle pain, and rash. Occasionally, not only themeninges—the covering around the brain and spinalcord— is infected, but also brain tissue itself, produc-ing encephalitis. The illness resolves after about a weekor so, and permanent damage is unusual. Enterovirusescan also produce the Guillian-Barré syndrome, whichinvolves weakness and paralysis of the extremities and
even the muscles of respiration.
• Pleurodynia (Bornholm’s disease) is due to viral infec-
tion and inflammation of the chest and abdominal mus-cles used for breathing. Pain occurs as acute episodes,lasting 30 minutes or so. Coxsackie B virus is the usualcause of the illness.
• Myocarditis and/or pericarditis involves infection of"
"• Myocarditis and/or pericarditis involves infection of
the heart muscle (myocardium) and the coveringaround the heart (pericardium). Infants and youngadults are the most susceptible, and for some reason,over two-thirds of cases occur in males. The diseaseusually begins as an upper respiratory tract infectionwith cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Chest pain,
increasing shortness of breath, irregularities of cardiacrhythm, and heart failure sometimes develop. Some
patients wind up with long term heart failure if the heartmuscle is significantly affected.
• Exanthems is the medical term for rashes , and
enterovirus is the number one cause of summer and fallrashes in children. They occur anywhere on the body,and often resemble diseases such as measles .
• Hand-foot-and-mouth disease occurs initially as a sore"
"• Hand-foot-and-mouth disease occurs initially as a sore
throat (often involving the tongue as well), and is fol-lowed by a rash on the hands, and sometimes the feet.The rash often forms small blisters, which lead toulcers. Symptoms generally resolve within a week. Aspecific Coxsackievirus (A16) is the most frequentcause of this highly infectious disease.
• Herpangina is most often caused by one of the Cox-
sackie A viruses, and appears as the acute onset of feverand sore throat. This last symptom is particularlysevere, as the virus produces multiple ulcers in thethroat. Swallowing becomes very painful; symptomscan persist for several weeks.
• Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis involves viral infec-
tion of the conjunctiva, which is a covering around theeye. Pain, blurred vision, aversion to light, and a dis-charge from the eye are the main symptoms. Headache

"and fever occur in about one in five patients. The dis-
ease runs its course in about 10 days.
A number of other illnesses have been attributed to
enteroviruses, including pneumonia and other respirato-
ry infections, myositis or muscle inflammation, arthritis,and acute inflammation of the kidneys. It is clear thenthat these viruses produce a number of various illnesses,most often in younger age groups.
Diagnosis
In the majority of cases, diagnosis is based on the
characteristic symptoms that the virus produces (such asthe chest pain in pleurodynia). Rarely is it necessary toidentify a specific strain of virus causing the illness. It ismore important to be certain that the infection is due to avirus which does not require treatment with antibiotics .
Culture, or growing the organism outside of the body,"
"Culture, or growing the organism outside of the body,
is helpful only when obtained from areas that tend to indi-cate recent infection, such as from swollen joints, cere-brospinal fluid, or blood. Cultures from other areas, suchas the throat, can be misleading. This is because the virusmay remain for long periods of time in places with a largeamount of lymphatic tissue. As a rule, cultures done earlyin the illness are more likely to identify the virus.
New techniques that involve identification of viral
genetic material (PCR) are useful in certain cases, but arenot indicated for routine testing.
Treatment
As noted above, enterovirus is capable of attacking
many different organs and producing a variety of symp-toms. Most infections are mild and improve withoutcomplications, and require no specific therapy. When thevirus attacks critical organs however, such as the heart,respiratory muscles, nervous system, etc., then special-ized care is often needed."
"As of 2001, no effective antiviral medication for
enterovirus has undergone investigation in patients,though some drugs appear promising for the future. Insome patients who are unable to produce antibodies(hypogammaglobunemia), administrating antibodiesthemselves is helpful.
Prognosis
The overall outlook for enterovirus infection
depends on the organs involved, and the immune condi-tion of the individual patient. Unless vital organs areinvolved or immunity is abnormal, infection causes fewproblems. On the other hand, patients who have diseasesKEY TERMS

Prevention
In the hospital setting, the best means of avoiding
transmission of infection is the use of good hand-wash-ing practices and other appropriate precautions (gownsand gloves for hospital staff). The virus is found in fecesfor up to one week after infection; therefore precautionsthat isolate waste material (enteric precautions) will helpdecrease the chance of spreading the illness.

Enzyme therapy
Definition
Enyzme therapy is a plan of dietary supplements of
plant and animal enzymes used to facilitate the digestiveprocess and improve the body’s ability to maintain bal-anced metabolism.
Purpose
In traditional medicine, enzyme supplements are
often prescribed for patients suffering from disordersthat affect the digestive process, such as cystic
fibrosis , Gaucher’s disease, and celiac disease . A pro-
gram of enzyme supplementation is rarely recommend-ed for healthy patients. However, proponents ofenzyme therapy believe that such a program is benefi-cial for everyone. They point to enzymes’ ability topurify the blood, strengthen the immune system,enhance mental capacity, cleanse the colon, and main-tain proper pH balance in urine. They feel that byimproving the digestive process, the body is better ableto combat infection and disease.

"Some evidence exists that pancreatic enzymes
derived from animal sources are helpful in cancer treat-
ment. The enzymes may be able to dissolve the coatingon cancer cells and may make it easier for the immunesystem to attack the cancer.

"Description
Origins
Enzymes are protein molecules used by the body to
perform all of its chemical actions and reactions. Thebody manufactures several thousands of enzymes.Among them are the digestive enzymes produced by thestomach, pancreas, small intestine, and the salivaryglands of the mouth. Their energy-producing propertiesare responsible for not only the digestion of nutrients, buttheir absorption, transportation, metabolization, andelimination as well.
Enzyme therapy is based on the work of Dr. Edward
Howell in the 1920s and 1930s. Howell proposed thatenzymes from foods work in the stomach to pre-digestfood. He advocated the consumption of large amounts ofplant enzymes, theorizing that if the body had to use lessof its own enzymes for digestion, it could store them formaintaining metabolic harmony. Four categories of plantenzymes are helpful in pre-digestion: protease, amylase,lipase, and cellulase. Cellulase is particularly helpfulbecause the body is unable to produce it."
"Animal enzymes, such as pepsin extracted from the
stomach of pigs, work more effectively in the duodenum.They are typically used for the treatment of nondigestiveailments.

"• amylase breaks down starches
• cellulase breaks down fibers
• lactase breaks down dairy products
• lipase breaks down fats
• maltase breaks down grains
• protease breaks down proteins• sucrase breaks down sugars
Enzyme theory generated further interest as the
human diet became more dependent on processed andcooked foods. Enzymes are extremely sensitive to heat,and temperatures above 118°F (48°C) destroy them. Mod-ern processes of pasteurization, canning, and microwavingare particularly harmful to the enzymes in food.

"Enzyme supplements are extracted from plants like
pineapple and papaya and from the organs of cows andpigs. The supplements are typically given in tablet orcapsule form. Pancreatic enzymes may also be given byinjection. The dosage varies with the condition beingtreated. For nondigestive ailments, the supplements aretaken in the hour before meals so that they can be quicklyabsorbed into the blood. For digestive ailments, the sup-plements are taken immediately before meals accompa-nied by a large glass of fluids. Pancreatic enzymes maybe accompanied by doses of vitamin A.

"Eosinophilic pneumonia
Definition
Eosinophilic pneumonia is a group of diseases in
which there is an above normal number of eosinophils inthe lungs and blood.
Description
Eosinophilia is an increase in the number of
eosinophils. Eosinophilic pneumonia is characterizedby a large number of eosinophils in the lungs, usually inthe absence of an infectious disease. Eosinophils areone of the white blood cells and are classified as a gran-ulocyte. They are part of the non-specific immune sys-tem and participate in inflammatory reactions.Eosinophils contain cationic molecules that are usefulfor destroying infectious agents, especially heiminthicparasites (worms). There are several types ofeosinophilic pneumonia. Loffler’s pneumonia is a tem-porary infiltration of eosinophils into the lungs. Thepatient will feel tired, have a cough , spasms of the"
"bronchial airway, and difficulty breathing. Loffler’spneumonia will clear spontaneously, but slowly overthe course of about a month. Another form ofeosinophilic pneumonia, pulmonary infiltrates witheosinophilia (PIE), is a more serious and potentiallyfatal disease. In PIE, the patient experiences asthma ,
pulmonary infiltrates, disorders of the peripheral ner-vous system, central nervous systems symptoms, andperiarteritis nodosa.

"Causes and symptoms
Pneumonia with eosinophils occurs as part of a
hypersensitivity reaction. A hypersensitivity reactionis an over-reaction of the immune system to a particu-lar stimulus. As part of the hypersensitive reaction,cells of the immune system are produced in increasednumbers and migrate into areas targeted by the hyper-sensitivity reaction. In the case of eosinophilic pneu-monia, the lungs are the target. Generally, eosinophiliapneumonia is not a reaction to an infection. There is acorrelation between asthma and eosinophilic pneumo-nia. Eosinophilic pneumonia can also be caused bydrugs and, in some people, by polluted air. The symp-toms range from mild (coughing, wheezing , and
shortness of breath ) to severe and life threatening
(severe shortness of breath and difficulty gettingenough oxygen). The symptoms may resolve sponta-neously or can persist for long periods of time. In afew cases, the disease may rapidly produce life-threat-ening pneumonia.KEY TERMS"
"Infiltrates —Cells or body fluids that have passed
into a tissue or body cavity.
Sputum —Material coughed up from the throat or
lungs.
Diagnosis
Since eosinophilia is common to a number of condi-
tions, the physician must rule out asthma and infectionby helminths when diagnosing eosinophilic pneumonia.A whole blood count will reveal an increased number of
eosinophils in the blood. An x ray of the lungs may showthe presence of infiltrates (the eosinophils and fluid). Ifsputum is produced in coughing, eosinophils will be seeninstead of the more normal profile of granulocytes seenwhen an infectious agent is present.
Treatment
Eosinophilic pneumonia may not respond to drugs"
"Treatment
Eosinophilic pneumonia may not respond to drugs
used to treat asthma. Eosinophilic pneumonia is usuallytreated with steroids, particularly glucocorticosteroids.Steroids are not effective against infectious agents, butthe main disease process in eosinophilic pneumonia is aninflammatory reaction, not a response to infection. Wheneosinophilia is produced as a consequence of asthma oran infection by helminths, treatment of the asthma orhelminths will reduce the eosinophilia.

"Epidermolysis bullosa
Definition
Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of rare inherited
skin diseases that are characterized by the development ofblisters following minimal pressure to the skin. Blisteringoften appears in infancy in response to simply being held orhandled. In rarer forms of the disorder, EB can be life-threatening. There is no cure for the disorder. Treatmentfocuses on preventing and treating wounds and infection.
Description
Epidermolysis bullosa has three major forms and at
least 16 subtypes. The three major forms are EB simplex,junctional EB, and dystrophic EB. These can range inseverity from mild blistering to more disfiguring and life-threatening disease. Physicians diagnose the form of thedisease based on where the blister forms in relation to theepidermis (the skin’s outermost layer) and the deeperdermis layer.
The prevalence of epidermolysis varies among dif-"
"The prevalence of epidermolysis varies among dif-
ferent populations. A study in Scotland estimated theprevalence to be one in 20,400. Researchers in otherparts of the world estimate the prevalence to be one in100,000. This variance is due to the variability of expres-sion. Many cases of epidermolysis bullosa are often notaccurately diagnosed and thus, are not reported.
Causes and symptoms
EB can be inherited as the result of a dominant
genetic abnormality (only one parent carries the abnor-mal gene) or a recessive genetic abnormality (both par-ents carry the abnormal gene).
EB simplex results from mutations in genes respon-
sible for keratin 5 and 14, which are proteins that givecells of the epidermis its structure. EB simplex is trans-mitted in an autosomal dominant fashion.
Dystrophic EB is caused by mutations in genes for"
"Dystrophic EB is caused by mutations in genes for
type VII collagen, the protein contained in the fibersanchoring the epidermis to the deeper layers of the skin.The genetic mutations for junctional EB are found in thegenes responsible for producing the protein Laminin-5.Dystrophic EB is an autosomal disorder and will onlyresult if both parents transmit an abnormal gene duringconception.
EB simplex, the most common form of EB, is the
least serious form of the disease. In most affected indi-viduals, the blisters are mild and do not scar after theyheal. Some forms of EB simplex affect just the hands andKEY TERMS

feet. Other forms of EB simplex can lead to more wide-
spread blistering, as well as hair loss and missing teeth.Recurrent blistering is annoying but not life threatening.
The second, or junctional, form of EB does not lead to
scarring. However, skin on the areas prone to blistering,such as elbows and knees, often shrinks. In one variationof junctional EB, called gravis junctional EB of Herlitz,the blistering can be so severe that affected infants may notsurvive due to massive infection and dehydration .
The third form of EB, dystrophic EB, varies greatly
in terms of severity, but more typically affects the armsand legs. In one variation, called Hallopeau-Siemens EB,repeated blistering and scarring of the hands and feetcauses the fingers and toes to fuse, leaving them dysfunc-tional and with a mitten-like appearance.

"Diagnosis
Physicians and researchers distinguish between the
three major subtypes of EB based on which layer of theepidermis separates from the deeper dermis layer of theskin below. Patients suspected of having EB should have afresh blister biopsied for review. This sample of tissue isexamined under an electron microscope or under a con-ventional microscope using a technique called immunoflu-orescence, which helps to map the underlying structure.
Knowing that a family member has EB can help
establish the diagnosis, but it is possible that parents orsiblings will show no sign of the disease, either becauseit is caused by a new genetic mutation, or because theparents are carriers of the recessive trait and do not dis-play the disease.
Treatment
The most important treatment for EB is daily wound
care. Because the skin is very fragile, care must be takento be certain that dressing changes do not cause furtherdamage. Tape should not be applied directly to skin and"

"bandages should be soaked off. Infection is a major con-
cern, so a topical antibiotic, such as bacitracin, mupirocin,or sulfadiazine, should be routinely applied. Among per-sons with recessive dystrophic EB, the anticonvulsantphenytoin is sometimes effective because it decreasesproduction of an enzyme that breaks down collagen.
Prognosis
The prognosis of EB varies depending on the subtype
of the disease. Individuals with EB simplex can live long,fulfilling lives. The severity of the junctional and dys-trophic forms of EB can vary greatly. Infants affected withsome forms of the disease often do not survive infancy;other forms can lead to severe scarring and disfigurement.

Epididymitis
Definition
Epididymitis is inflammation or infection of the epi-
didymis. In this long coiled tube attached to the upperpart of each testicle, sperm mature and are stored beforeejaculation.
Description
Epididymitis is the most common cause of pain in
the scrotum. The acute form is usually associated withthe most severe pain and swelling. If symptoms last formore than six weeks after treatment begins, the conditionis considered chronic.
Epididymitis can occur any time after the onset of
puberty but is most common between the ages of 18 and
40. It is especially common among members of the mili-tary who exercise for extended periods without emptying
their bladders.
Factors that increase the risk of developing epi-
didymitis include:
• infection of the bladder, kidney, prostate, or urinary tract• other recent illness"
"• infection of the bladder, kidney, prostate, or urinary tract• other recent illness
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1218EpididymitisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1218"
"• narrowing of the urethra (the tube that drains urine
from the bladder)
• use of a urethral catheter.
Causes and symptoms
Although epididymitis can be caused by the same
organisms that cause some sexually transmitted dis-
eases (STDs) or occur after prostate surgery, the condi-
tion is generally due to pus-generating bacteria associat-ed with infections in other parts of the body.
Epididymitis can also be caused by injury or infec-
tion of the scrotum or by irritation from urine that hasaccumulated in the vas deferens (the duct through whichsperm travels after leaving the epididymis).
Epididymitis is characterized by sudden redness and
swelling of the scrotum. The affected testicle is hard andsore, and the other testicle may feel tender. The patienthas chills and fever and usually has acute urethritis
(inflammation of the urethra).
Enlarged lymph nodes in the groin cause scrotal pain
that intensifies throughout the day and may become sosevere that walking normally becomes impossible."
"Diagnosis
Laboratory tests used to diagnose epididymitis
include:
• urinalysis and urine culture
• examination of discharges from the urethra and prostate
gland
• blood tests to measure white-cell counts
Treatment
Because epididymitis that affects both testicles can
make a man sterile, antibiotic therapy must be initiatedas soon as symptoms appear. To prevent reinfection,medication must be taken exactly as prescribed, even ifthe patient’s symptoms disappear or he begins to feel bet-ter. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatories can relievepain but should not be used without the approval of afamily physician or urologist.
Bed rest is recommended until symptoms subside,
and patients are advised to wear athletic supporters whenthey resume normal activities. If pain is severe, a localanesthetic like lidocaine (Xylocaine) may be injecteddirectly into the spermatic cord.
Self-care
A patient who has epididymitis should not drink"
"Self-care
A patient who has epididymitis should not drink
beverages that contain caffeine . To prevent constipation ,he should use stool softeners or eat plenty of fruit, nuts,
whole grain cereals, and other foods with laxative prop-erties.
An ice bag wrapped in a towel can reduce pain and
swelling but should be removed from the inflamed areafor a few minutes every hour to prevent burns .
Strenuous activity should be avoided until symp-
toms disappear. Sexual activity should not be resumeduntil a month after symptoms disappear.
If a second course of treatment doesn’t eradicate
stubborn symptoms, longterm anti-inflammatory therapymay be recommended. In rare instances, chronic symp-toms require surgery.
Surgery
Each of the surgical procedures used to treat epi-
didymitis is performed under local anesthesia on an out-patient basis. Both of them cause sterility.
Epididymectomy involves removing the inflamed
section of the epididymitis through a small incision in thescrotum."
"section of the epididymitis through a small incision in thescrotum.
Bilateral vasectomy prevents fluid and sperm from
passing through the epididymis. This procedure is usual-ly performed on men who have chronic epididymitis oron elderly patients undergoing prostate surgery.
Prognosis
Pain generally subsides 24–72 hours after treatment
begins. Complete healing may take weeks or months.
Prevention
Using condoms and not having sex with anyone who
has an STD can prevent some cases of epididymitis.

"Epiglottitis
Definition
Epiglottitis is an infection of the epiglottis, which
can lead to severe airway obstruction.
Description
When air is inhaled (inspired), it passes through the
nose and the nasopharynx or through the mouth and theoropharynx. These are both connected to the larynx, atube made of cartilage. The air continues down the larynxto the trachea. The trachea then splits into two branches,the left and right bronchi (bronchial tubes). These bronchibranch into smaller air tubes that run within the lungs,leading to the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli).
Either food, liquid, or air may be taken in through"
"Either food, liquid, or air may be taken in through
the mouth. While air goes into the larynx and the respira-tory system, food and liquid are directed into the tubeleading to the stomach, the esophagus. Because food orliquid in the bronchial tubes or lungs could cause ablockage or lead to an infection, the airway is protected.The epiglottis is a leaf-like piece of cartilage extendingupwards from the larynx. The epiglottis can close downover the larynx when someone is eating or drinking, pre-venting these food and liquids from entering the airway.
Epiglottitis is an infection and inflammation of the
epiglottis. Because the epiglottis may swell considerably,there is a danger that the airway will be blocked off bythe very structure designed to protect it. Air is thenunable to reach the lungs. Without intervention, epiglotti-tis has the potential to be fatal.
Epiglottitis is primarily a disease of two to seven-"
"Epiglottitis is primarily a disease of two to seven-
year-old children, although older children and adults canalso contract it. Boys are twice as likely as girls to devel-op this infection. Because epiglottitis involves swellingand infection of tissues, which are all located at or abovethe level of the epiglottis, it is sometimes referred to assupraglottitis ( supra, meaning above). About 25% of all
children with this infection also have pneumonia .
Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of epiglottitis is infection
with the bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae type b.
Other types of bacteria are also occasionally responsi-ble for this infection, including some types of Strepto-
coccus bacteria and the bacteria responsible for causing
diphtheria .
A patient with epiglottitis typically experiences a
sudden fever , and begins having severe throat and neckpain . Because the swollen epiglottis interferes signifi-"
"cantly with air movement, every breath creates a loud,harsh, high-pitched sound referred to as stridor . Because
the vocal cords are located in the larynx just below thearea of the epiglottis, the swollen epiglottis makes thepatient’s voice sound muffled and strained. Swallowingbecomes difficult, and the patient may drool. The patientoften leans forward and juts out his or her jaw, whilestruggling for breath.
Epiglottitis strikes suddenly and progresses quickly.
A child may begin complaining of a sore throat , and
within a few hours be suffering from extremely severeairway obstruction.

"Diagnosis
Diagnosis begins with a high level of suspicion that
a quickly progressing illness with fever, sore throat, andairway obstruction is very likely to be epiglottitis. Ifepiglottitis is suspected, no efforts should be made tolook at the throat, or to swab the throat in order to obtaina culture for identification of the causative organism.These maneuvers may cause the larynx to go into spasm(laryngospasm), completely closing the airway. Theseprocedures should only be performed in a fully-equippedoperating room, so that if laryngospasm occurs, a breath-ing tube can be immediately placed in order to keep theairway open.
An instrument called a laryngoscope is often used in
the operating room to view the epiglottis, which willappear cherry-red and quite swollen. An x-ray picturetaken from the side of the neck should also be obtained.The swollen epiglottis has a characteristic appearance,called the “thumb sign.”
Treatment

"Treatment
Treatment almost always involves the immediate
establishment of an artificial airway: inserting a breath-ing tube into the throat (intubation); or making a tinyopening toward the base of the neck and putting a breath-ing tube into the trachea (tracheostomy). Because thepatient’s apparent level of distress may not match theactual severity of the situation, and because the disease’sprogression can be quite surprisingly rapid, it is prefer-able to go ahead and place the artificial airway, ratherthan adopting a wait-and-see approach.
Because epiglottitis is caused by a bacteria, antibi-
otics such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ampicillin with
sulbactam should be given through a needle placed in avein (intravenously). This prevents the bacteria that arecirculating throughout the bloodstream from causinginfection elsewhere in the body.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1220EpiglottitisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1220"
"Prognosis
With treatment (including the establishment of an
artificial airway), only about 1% of children with epiglot-titis die. Without the artificial airway, this figure jumps to6%. Most patients recover form the infection, and canhave the breathing tube removed (extubation) within afew days.
Prevention
Prevention involves the use of a vaccine against H.
influenzae type b (called the Hib vaccine). It is given to
babies at two, four, six, and 15 months. Use of this vac-cine has made epiglottitis a very rare occurrence.

Episiotomy
Definition
An episiotomy is a surgical incision made in the area
between the vagina and anus (perineum). This is doneduring the last stages of labor and delivery to expand theopening of the vagina to prevent tearing during the deliv-ery of the baby.
Purpose
This procedure is usually done during the delivery or
birthing process when the vaginal opening does notstretch enough to allow the baby to be delivered withouttearing the surrounding tissue.
Precautions"
"Precautions
Prior to the onset of labor, pregnant women may
want to discuss the use of episiotomy with their careproviders. It is possible that, with adequate preparationand if the stages of labor and delivery are managed withadequate coaching and support, the need for an episioto-my may be reduced.
Description
An episiotomy is a surgical incision, usually made
with sterile scissors, in the perineum as the baby’s head isbeing delivered. This procedure may be used if the tissuearound the vaginal opening begins tearing or does not seemto be stretching enough to allow the baby to be delivered.

"In most cases, the physician makes a midline inci-
sion along a straight line from the lowest edge of thevaginal opening to toward the anus. In other cases, theepisiotomy is performed by making a diagonal incisionacross the midline between the vagina and anus. Thismethod is used much less often, may be more painful,and may require more healing time than the midline inci-sion. After the baby is delivered through the extendedvaginal opening, the incision is closed with stitches. Alocal anesthetic agent may be applied or injected to numbthe area before it is sewn up (sutured).

"Several reasons are cited for performing epi-
siotomies. Some experts believe that an episiotomyspeeds up the birthing process, making it easier for thebaby to be delivered. This can be important if there is anysign of distress that may harm the mother or baby.Because tissues in this area may tear during the delivery,another reason for performing an episiotomy is that aclean incision is easier to repair than a jagged tear andmay heal faster. Although the use of episiotomy is some-times described as protecting the pelvic muscles and pos-sibly preventing future problems with urinary inconti-
nence , it is not clear that the procedure actually helps.
The use of episiotomy during the birthing process is"
"The use of episiotomy during the birthing process is
fairly widespread in the United States. Estimates of epi-siotomy use in hospitals range from 65–95% of deliver-ies, depending on how many times the mother has givenbirth previously. This routine use of episiotomy is beingreexamined in many hospitals and health care settings.However, an episiotomy is always necessary during a
forceps delivery because of the size of the forceps.
Preparation
It may be possible to avoid the need for an episioto-
my. Pregnant women may want to talk with their careproviders about the use of episiotomy during the deliv-ery. Kegel exercises are often recommended during thepregnancy to help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles."
"Prenatal perineal massage may help to stretch and relaxthe tissue around the vaginal opening. During the deliv-ery process, warm compresses can be applied to the areaalong with the use of perineal massage. Coaching andsupport are also important during the delivery process. Aslowed, controlled pushing during the second stage oflabor (when the mother gets the urge to push) may allowthe tissues to stretch rather than tear. Also, an uprightbirthing position (rather than one where the mother islying down) may decrease the need for an episiotomy.
Aftercare
The area of the episiotomy may be uncomfortable or
even painful for several days. Several practices canrelieve some of the pain . Cold packs can be applied to
the perineal area to reduce swelling and discomfort. Useof the Sitz bath available at the hospital or birth center
can ease the discomfort, too. This unit circulates warmwater over the area. A squirt bottle with water can beused to clean the area after urination or defecation rather"

Epstein-Barr virus test
Definition
The Epstein-Barr virus test is a blood test, or group of
tests, to determine the presence or absence of antibodies inthe blood stream directed against proteins of the Epstein-Barr virus, the cause of infectious mononucleosis .

"Purpose
The test is primarily used to detect whether first time
infection (called primary infection) with the Epstein-Barrvirus is currently occurring, or has occurred within ashort period of time. The pattern of the antibodies detect-ed can, however, tell if the person has never been infect-ed with the Epstein-Barr virus, or if the infectionoccurred in the more distant past. These tests are mostlyutilized in the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-associatedinfectious mononucleosis when the more common diag-nostic test, the heterophile antibody, is negative, or in sit-uations where the infection is manifesting unusual symp-toms. Therefore, the tests are often not needed in a situa-

"tion where a doctor believes that a person has mononu-
cleosis and the heterophile test (also called the monospottest) is positive.
In addition, Epstein-Barr virus testing is usually not
needed in the evaluation of a patient who has long-last-ing fatigue , and may have the chronic fatigue syn-
drome . Initially, it was thought that discovering a partic-
ular pattern of antibodies to this virus was helpful in thediagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, but this no longerappears to be the case.
Precautions
As in any blood test, standard precautions should be
performed to prevent infection at the site where the bloodis obtained, and to prevent excess bleeding. Normally,the site is cleaned with an antiseptic liquid prior to theblood being obtained; a sterile non-reusable needle andsyringe are used; and, once the needle is removed, pres-sure is placed at the site until bleeding has stopped.
Description

"Description
These tests are more often performed in a consulting
laboratory than at a physician’s office or in a hospitallaboratory. Like most antibody tests, they are performedon serum, the liquid part of the blood obtained after thewhole blood is allowed to clot in a tube. Antibodies canbe detected against several components of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). These components are the EBV earlyantigen (EA), the viral capsid antigen (VCA), and thenuclear antigen (EBNA). These several antigens are dif-ferent proteins that are produced in the process (stages)of the virus’ growth.
At the time of infection with Epstein-Barr virus,
antibodies to EA are found and usually last for four to sixmonths only. This antibody, however, persists substan-tially longer in about 10% of persons who have had EBVinfection in the more remote past. The absence of anti-body to EA when other EBV antibodies are presentstrongly suggests that first time infection with EBVoccurred in the past."
"Antibody to VCA is found both early and late in
EBV infection. At the time of infection, antibody ofboth the IgM and IgG types are detectable. After four tosix months, usually, only the IgG antibody against VCAcan be found.
Unlike antibodies to EA and VCA, antibody to
EBNA does not usually develop until recovery from firsttime infection of this virus. Therefore, finding detectableamounts of antibody to EBNA during an illness whichmight be caused by EBV makes the causal relationshipvery unlikely.Preparation
The skin area from which the blood sample will be
obtained is wiped with an antiseptic such as alcohol oriodine.
Aftercare
The aftercare is similar to that for any blood test."
"Aftercare
The aftercare is similar to that for any blood test.
Usually, pressure is applied to the area for severalmoments until bleeding stops. If the results are difficultto interpret, it may be necessary to re-test later, afterwaiting one to three weeks. The change in the amounts ofantibody detected between the two tests can be particu-larly useful, at times, in helping to make a diagnosis.
Risks
There are no risks over and above those of having
blood drawn for any other purpose. These tests are moreexpensive than many other blood tests but are usuallycovered by medical insurance.
Normal results
The pattern of the three antibodies can be used to
determine whether the person has not had infection withEBV to this point (is susceptible to infection); is current-ly, or recently, infected with EBV for the first time; orhas had first time infection with EBV sometime in thepast (more than six months ago).

EBV in the past, and call that category one; or havinghad it in the past, and call that category two. Most youngchildren below the age of five will fall into category one,while most adults over the age of 20 years will fall intocategory two.
The results for susceptibility are:
• antibody to EA = negative
• antibody to VCA (either IgM or IgG) = negative
• antibody to EBNA = Negative
The results for past infection are:
• antibody to EA = negative (90% of time)
• antibody to VCA IgM = negative

ple who can transmit EBV to others without themselvesbeing ill.
Abnormal results
The results for current or recent infection are:
• antibody to EA = positive
• antibody to VCA IgM = positive
• antibody to VCA IgG = positive• antibody to EBNA = negative
Without the pattern of the three antibodies, it can be
difficult to be accurate in interpretation. The presence ofantibody to VCA IgM is the best single test for current orrecent first time infection.

Erysipelas
Definition
Erysipelas is a skin infection that often follows strep
throat .
Description
Erysipelas, also called St. Anthony’s fire, is caused
by infection by Group A Streptococci. This same type ofKEY TERMS
Bacteremia —The presence of bacteria in the
blood.
Streptococcus —A bacteria that causes erysipelas
and strep throat, as well as other infections.
bacteria is responsible for such infections as strep throat,
and infections of both surgical and other kinds ofwounds in the skin. The infection occurs most often in
young infants and the elderly.
Causes and symptoms
Erysipelas usually occurs rather abruptly. When the
preceding infection was strep throat, the rash begins onthe face. Occasionally, when the preceding infection wasof a wound from an injury or operation, the rash willappear on an arm or leg."
"Classically, the usual presentation is a bright-red,
butterfly-shaped rash appearing across the bridge of thenose and the cheeks. It is hot to the touch, painful, shiny,and swollen, with clearly defined margins. The edges ofthe rash are a raised ridge, hard to the touch. There maybe fluid-filled bumps scattered along the area. The rashspreads rapidly. Some patients have swelling of the eye-lids, sometimes so severe that their eyes swell shut. Thepatient may have fever , chills, loss of energy, nausea
and vomiting , and swollen, tender lymph nodes. In
severe cases, walled-off areas of pus (abscesses) maydevelop beneath the skin. If left untreated, the strepto-coccal bacteria may begin circulating in the bloodstream(a condition called bacteremia ). A patient may then
develop an overwhelming, systemic infection called sep-
sis, with a high risk of death .
Diagnosis

"sis, with a high risk of death .
Diagnosis
The rash of erysipelas is very characteristic, raising
the practitioner’s suspicion towards that diagnosis, espe-cially when coupled with a history of recent strep infec-tion. Attempts to culture (grow) the bacteria from a sam-ple of the rash usually fail. When the bacteria are presentin the blood, they may be grown in a laboratory, andidentified under a microscope. Other laboratory testsinvolve reacting fluorescently-tagged antibodies with asample of the patient’s infected tissue. This type of testmay be successful in positively identifying the strepto-coccal bacteria.

"Treatment
Penicillin is the drug of choice for treating erysipelas.
It can usually be given by mouth, although in severe cases(or in cases of diagnosed bacteremia) it may be giventhrough a needle placed in a vein (intravenously).
Even with antibiotic treatment, swelling may contin-
ue to spread. Other symptoms, such as fever, pain , and
redness, usually decrease rapidly after penicillin is start-ed. Cold packs and pain relievers may help decrease dis-comfort. Within about five to 10 days, the affected skinmay begin drying up and flaking off.
Prognosis
With prompt treatment, the prognosis from erysi-
pelas is excellent. Delay of treatment, however, increasesthe chance for bacteremia and the potential for deathfrom overwhelming sepsis. This is particularly true ofpeople with weakened immune systems (babies, theelderly, and people ill with other diseases, especiallyAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS ). Fre-"
"quently, an individual who has had erysipelas will have itoccur again in the same location.
Prevention
Prevention involves appropriate and complete treat-
ment of streptococcal infections , including strep throat
and wound infections.

Erythema infectiosum seeFifth diseaseErythema multiforme
Definition
Erythema multiforme is a skin disease that causes
lesions and redness around the lesions.
Description
Erythema multiforme appears on the skin and the
mucous membranes (the lining of the mouth, digestivetract, vagina, and other organs). Large, symmetrical redblotches appear all over the skin in a circular pattern. Onmucous membranes, it begins as blisters and progressesto ulcers. A more advanced form, called Stevens-Johnsonsyndrome, can be severe and even fatal.
Causes and symptoms
Erythema multiforme has many causes, most com-
monly are drugs. Penicillin, sulfonamides , certain epilep-"
"monly are drugs. Penicillin, sulfonamides , certain epilep-
sy drugs, aspirin , and acetaminophen are the most likely
medication-induced causes. Erythema multiforme canalso be caused by certain diseases. Herpes virus andmycoplasma pneumonia are likely infectious causes.
Diagnosis
The appearance of the rash is sufficiently unique to
identify it on sight. Having identified it, the physicianwill determine the underlying cause.
Treatment
Erythema multiforme is inadvertently treated when
the causative agent, whether it be a drug or a disease, istreated. In severe cases, cortisone-like medication isoften used along with general supportive measures andprevention of infection.
Prognosis
As a rule, the rash abates by itself without damaging
the skin. Only in the case of infection, severe blistering,or continued use of an offending drug does complica-tions occur.

Erythema nodosum
Definition
Erythema nodosum is a skin disorder characterized
by painful red nodules appearing mostly on the shins.
Description
Erythema nodosum is an eruption of tender red
lumps on both shins and occasionally the arms and face.Bruising often accompanies the nodule formation. Ery-thema nodosum is most prevalent in young adults.
Causes and symptoms
Erythema nodosum can be caused by many impor-
tant and treatable diseases. Among them are tuberculo-
sis, several fungal lung infections, leprosy , inflammatory
bowel disease, and some potentially dangerous bacterialinfections. Drugs can also induce erythema nodosum.The most common are penicillin, sulfonamides , and
birth control pills.
Diagnosis
There are a few other skin eruptions that mimic ery-"
"birth control pills.
Diagnosis
There are a few other skin eruptions that mimic ery-
thema nodosum, so the physician may have to perform abiopsy to sort them out. There are a few types of panni-

Definition
Erythroblastosis fetalis refers to two potentially dis-
abling or fatal blood disorders in infants: Rh incompatibil-ity disease and ABO incompatibility disease. Either dis-ease may be apparent before birth and can cause fetaldeath in some cases. The disorder is caused by incompati-
bility between a mother’s blood and her unborn baby’sblood. Because of the incompatibility, the mother’simmune system may launch an immune response againstthe baby’s red blood cells. As a result, the baby’s blood

"cells are destroyed, and the baby may suffer severe anemia
(deficiency in red blood cells), brain damage, or death.
Description
Red blood cells carry several types of proteins,
called antigens, on their surfaces. The A, B, and O anti-gens are used to classify a person’s blood as type A, B,AB, or O. Each parent passes one A, B, or O antigengene to their child. How the genes are paired determinesthe person’s blood type.
A person who inherits an A antigen gene from each
parent has type A blood; receiving two B antigen genescorresponds with type B blood; and inheriting A and Bantigen genes means a person has type AB blood. If theO antigen gene is inherited from both parents, the childhas type O blood; however, the pairing of A and O anti-gen genes corresponds with type A blood; and if the Bantigen gene is matched with the O antigen gene, the per-son has type B blood.
Another red blood cell antigen, called the Rh factor,"
"Another red blood cell antigen, called the Rh factor,
also plays a role in describing a person’s blood type. Aperson with at least one copy of the gene for the Rh fac-tor has Rh-positive blood; if no copies are inherited, theperson’s blood type is Rh-negative. In blood typing, thepresence of A, B, and O antigens, plus the presence orabsence of the Rh-factor, determine a person’s specificblood type, such as A-positive, B-negative, and so on.
A person’s blood type has no effect on health. How-
ever, an individual’s immune system considers only thatperson’s specific blood type, or a close match, accept-able. If a radically different blood type is introduced intothe bloodstream, the immune system produces antibod-ies, proteins that specifically attack and destroy any cellcarrying the foreign antigen.
Determining a person’s blood type is very important"
"Determining a person’s blood type is very important
if she becomes pregnant. Blood cells from the unbornbaby (fetal red blood cells) can cross over into the moth-er’s bloodstream, especially at delivery. If the mother andher baby have compatible blood types, the crossoverdoes not present any danger. However, if the blood typesare incompatible, the mother’s immune system manufac-tures antibodies against the baby’s blood.
Usually, this incompatibility is not a factor in a first
pregnancy , because few fetal blood cells reach the
mother’s bloodstream until delivery. The antibodies thatform after delivery cannot affect the first child. In laterpregnancies, fetuses and babies may be in grave danger.The danger arises from the possibility that the mother’santibodies will attack the fetal red blood cells. If thishappens, the fetus or baby can suffer severe health effectsand may die.There are two types of incompatibility diseases: Rh"
"incompatibility disease and ABO incompatibility disease.Both diseases have similar symptoms, but Rh disease ismuch more severe, because anti-Rh antibodies cross overthe placenta more readily than anti-A or anti-B antibod-ies. (The immune system does not form antibodiesagainst the O antigen.) Therefore, a greater percentage ofthe baby’s blood cells are destroyed by Rh disease.
Both incompatibility diseases are uncommon in the
United States due to medical advances over the last 50years. For example, prior to 1946 (when newborn bloodtransfusions were introduced) 20,000 babies were affectedby Rh disease yearly. Further advances, such as suppress-ing the mother’s antibody response, have reduced the inci-dence of Rh disease to approximately 4,000 cases per year.

"Rh disease only occurs if a mother is Rh-negative and
her baby is Rh-positive. For this situation to occur, the babymust inherit the Rh factor gene from the father. Most peo-ple are Rh-positive. Only 15% of the caucasian populationis Rh-negative, compared to 5–7% of the african americanpopulation and virtually none of Asian populations.
ABO incompatibility disease is almost always limit-
ed to babies with A or B antigens whose mothers havetype O blood. Approximately one third of these babiesshow evidence of the mother’s antibodies in their blood-stream, but only a small percentage develop symptoms ofABO incompatibility disease.

"Cause and symptoms
Rh disease and ABO incompatibility disease are
caused when a mother’s immune system produces anti-bodies against the red blood cells of her unborn child.The antibodies cause the baby’s red blood cells to bedestroyed and the baby develops anemia. The baby’sbody tries to compensate for the anemia by releasingimmature red blood cells, called erythroblasts, from thebone marrow.
The overproduction of erythroblasts can cause the
liver and spleen to become enlarged, potentially causingliver damage or a ruptured spleen. The emphasis on ery-throblast production is at the cost of producing othertypes of blood cells, such as platelets and other factorsimportant for blood clotting. Since the blood lacks clot-ting factors, excessive bleeding can be a complication.

Other symptoms that may be present include high
levels of insulin and low blood sugar, as well as a condi-tion called hydrops fetalis. Hydrops fetalis is character-ized by an accumulation of fluids within the baby’s body,giving it a swollen appearance. This fluid accumulationinhibits normal breathing, because the lungs cannotexpand fully and may contain fluid. If this condition con-tinues for an extended period, it can interfere with lunggrowth.

Erythrocyte sedimentation
rate
Definition
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), or sedi-
mentation rate (sed rate), is a measure of the settling ofred blood cells in a tube of blood during one hour. Therate is an indication of inflammation and increases inmany diseases.
Purpose
ESR is increased in rheumatoid diseases, most infec-
tions, and in cancer . An advanced rate doesn’t diagnose
a specific disease, but it does indicate that an underlyingdisease may be present.
A physician can use ESR to monitor a person with an
associated disease. When the disease worsens, the ESRincreases; when the disease improves, the ESR decreases.The ESR doesn’t always follow the course of cancer.
ESR is called an acute-phase reactant test, meaning"
"ESR is called an acute-phase reactant test, meaning
that it reacts to acute conditions in the body, such asinfection or trauma. The rate increase follows a rise intemperature and white blood cells count, peaks after sev-eral days, and usually lasts longer than the elevated tem-perature or white blood cells count.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1230Erythrocyte sedimentation rateGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1230"
"Precautions
The ESR should not be used to screen healthy per-
sons for disease.
Description
The ESR test is a simple test dating back to the
ancient Greeks. A specific amount of diluted, unclottedblood is placed in a special narrow tube and left undis-turbed for exactly one hour. The red cells settle towardsthe bottom of the tube, and the pale yellow liquid (plas-ma) rises to the top. After 60 minutes, measurements aretaken of the distance the red cells traveled to settle at thebottom of the tube. Two methods, the Westergren and theWintrobe, are used by laboratories; each method pro-duces slightly different results. Most laboratories use theWestergren method.
Normally red cells don’t settle far toward the bottom
of the tube. Many diseases make extra or abnormal pro-teins that cause the red cells to move close together, stackup, and form a column (rouleaux). In a group, red cellsare heavier and fall faster. The faster they fall, the furtherthey settle, and the higher the ESR."
"The ESR test is covered by insurance when medical-
ly necessary. Results are usually available the same orfollowing day.
Preparation
This test requires 7mL–10 mL of blood. A health-
care worker ties a tourniquet on the patient’s upper arm,locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts aneedle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the bloodthrough the needle into an attached tube. Collection ofthe sample takes only a few minutes.
Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site.
Pressure applied to the puncture site until the bleedingstops reduces bruising. Warm packs to the puncture siterelieve discomfort. The patient may feel dizzy or faint.
Normal results
A normal value does not rule out disease. Normal val-
ues for the Westergren method are: Men 0 mm/hour–15mm/hour; women 0 mm/hour–20 mm/hour; and children 0mm/hour–10 mm/hour.

Description
The drugs described here include erythromycins
(Erythrocin, Ery-C, E-Mycin, and other brands) andmedicines that are chemically related to erythromycins,such as azithromycin (Zithromax) and clarithromycin(Biaxin). They are available only with a physician’s pre-scription and are sold in capsule, tablet (regular andchewable), liquid, and injectable forms.

The recommended dosage depends on the type of
erythromycin, the strength of the medicine, and the med-ical problem for which it is being taken. Check with thephysician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist whofilled the prescription for the correct dosage.
Always take erythromycins exactly as directed.
Never take larger, smaller, more frequent, or less fre-quent doses. To make sure the infection clears up com-pletely, it is very important to take the medicine for aslong as it has been prescribed. Do not stop taking thedrug just because symptoms begin to improve. This isimportant with all types of infections, but it is especiallyimportant in “strep” infections, which can lead to seriousheart problems if they are not cleared up completely.

"Erythromycins work best when they are at constant
levels in the blood. To help keep levels constant, take themedicine in doses spaced evenly through the day andnight. Do not miss any doses. Some of these medicinesare most effective when taken with a full glass of wateron an empty stomach, but they may be taken with food ifstomach upset is a problem. Others work equally wellwhen taken with or without food. Check package direc-tions or ask the physician or pharmacist for instructionson how to take the medicine.
Precautions
Symptoms should begin to improve within a few
days of beginning to take this medicine. If they do not, orif they get worse, check with the physician who pre-scribed the medicine.
Erythromycins may cause mild diarrhea , that usual-
ly goes away during treatment. However, severe diarrheacould be a sign of a very serious side effect .Anyone who"
"develops severe diarrhea while taking erythromycin orrelated drugs should stop taking the medicine and call aphysician immediately.
Special conditions
Taking erythromycins may cause problems for peo-
ple with certain medical conditions or people who aretaking certain other medicines. Before taking thesedrugs, be sure to let the physician know about any ofthese conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to erythromycins, azithromycin, or clarithromycin in thepast should let his or her physician know before takingthe drugs again. The physician should also be told aboutany allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other sub-
stances.
PREGNANCY. Some medicines in this group may
cause problems in pregnant women and have the poten-tial to cause birth defects . Women who are pregnant or
who may become pregnant should check with theirphysicians before taking these drugs.

"BREASTFEEDING. Erythromycins pass into breast
milk. Mothers who are breastfeeding and who need totake this medicine should check with their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using ery-

• heart disease• liver disease
• hearing loss
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking erythromycins
with certain other drugs may affect the way the drugswork or may increase the chance of side effects.
Side effects
The most common side effects are mild diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting, and stomach or abdominal cramps.These problems usually go away as the body adjusts tothe drug and do not require medical treatment. Less com-mon side effects, such as sore mouth or tongue and vagi-nal itching and discharge also may occur and do not need

Erythropoietin test
Definition
Erythropoietin, also called EPO, is a type of protein
called a glycoprotein that is formed mainly in the kid-neys to stimulate the production of red blood cells.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1233Erythropoietin testGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1233"
"Purpose
The erythropoietin (EPO) test is used to determine if
hormonal secretion is causing changes in the red bloodcells. The test has great value in evaluating low hemoglo-bin (anemia), and another disorder called polycythemia,in which unusually large numbers of red blood cells arefound in the blood. The EPO test is also used to identifykidney tumors and to evaluate abuse by athletes whobelieve commercially prepared erythropoietin enhancesperformance.
Precautions
Not every laboratory is equipped to evaluate EPO,
so the reference laboratory (a large commercial lab thatdoes tests for hospitals not equipped to do them) per-forming the test may require as many as four days tocomplete the analysis. It should also be noted that EPOvalues increase in pregnancy , in which significantly
higher levels are found before the twenty-fourth week.
Description
Erythropoietin is produced primarily in the kidneys"
"Description
Erythropoietin is produced primarily in the kidneys
but interacts with other factors in the bone marrow toincrease red cell production. EPO is unique among theblood cell growth factors, because it is the only one thatbehaves like a hormone.
Erythropoietin acts as the principal regulator in the
production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) by control-ling the number, the kinds, and the survival of the cells.Because of this ability, it is being investigated for use inKEY TERMS
Anemia —A condition in which the hemoglobin
concentration in the blood is below normal.
Polycythemia vera —A condition characterized by
an unusually large number of red blood cells inthe blood due to increased production by thebone marrow. Symptoms include headaches,blurred vision, high blood pressure, dizziness, andnight sweats.
Secondary polycythemia —Secondary polycythe-"
"Secondary polycythemia —Secondary polycythe-
mia occurs when the excess of red blood cells iscaused by a condition other than polycythemiavera. For example, when low levels of oxygen in theblood stimulate the bone marrow to produce morered blood cells, as in chronic lung disease.cancer patients to prevent anemia (hemoglobin concen-
tration in the blood is lower than normal), or to treat ane-mia that has been induced by chemotherapy and bone
marrow transplantation (BMT).
The correction of anemia can result in reduced
transfusion requirements, so the erythropoietin test is
used to diagnose anemia, including the anemia of end-stage renal disease. Erythropoietin determination is alsovaluable in diagnosing a condition known as poly-cythemia, when increased numbers of red blood cellsoccur. Levels of erythropoietin are extremely low inpolycythemia vera but are normal or high in secondary
polycythemia . It happens rarely, but cysts in the liver or"
"polycythemia . It happens rarely, but cysts in the liver or
kidneys, as well as tumors in the kidneys or brain, canalso produce erythropoietin. Patients with these condi-tions can have high levels of erythropoietin and maydevelop secondary polycythemia.
Some athletes use EPO to enhance performance, as
the increased red cell volume adds more oxygen-carryingcapacity to the blood. Adverse reactions to this practicecan include clotting abnormalities, headache , seizures,
high blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , and rash.
Preparation
The EPO test requires a blood sample. The patient is
to fast with nothing to eat or drink for at least eight hoursbefore the test. It is also suggested that the patient liedown for 30 minutes before the test.
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or
feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, and hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).
Normal results"
"Normal results
Reference values vary from laboratory to laboratory,
but a general normal range is 11–48 mU/ml (milliunitsper milliliter).
Abnormal results
Low levels of EPO are found in anemic patients with
inadequate or absent production of erythropoietin.Severe kidney disease may decrease production of EPO,and congenital absence of EPO can occur.
Elevated levels of EPO can be found in some ane-
mias when the body tries to overcompensate for reduced
blood volume. Elevated levels are also seen in poly-cythemia, and erythropoietin-secreting tumors.

Escherichia coli
Definition
E. coli (Escherichia coli) is one of several types of
bacteria that normally inhabit the intestine of humansand animals (commensal organism). Some strains of E.
coli are capable of causing disease under certain condi-
tions when the immune system is compromised or dis-ease may result from an environmental exposure.
Description
E. coli bacteria may give rise to infections in
wounds , the urinary tract, biliary tract, and abdominal
cavity ( peritonitis ). This organism may cause sep-
ticemia, neonatal meningitis , infantile gastroenteritis ,
tourist diarrhea , and hemorrhagic diarrhea. An E. coli"
"tourist diarrhea , and hemorrhagic diarrhea. An E. coli
infection may also arise due to environmental exposure.Infections with this type of bacteria pose a serious threatto public health with outbreaks arising from food andwater that has been contaminated with human or animalfeces or sewage. This type of bacteria has been used as abiological indicator for safety of drinking water since the1890s. Exposure may also occur during hospitalization,resulting in pneumonia in immunocompromised
patients or those on a ventilator
Causes and symptoms
The symptoms of infection and resulting complica-
tions are dependent upon the strain of E. coli and the site
of infection. These bacteria produce toxins that have awide range of effects. Symptoms caused by some E. coli
infections range from mild to severe, bloody diarrhea,acute abdominal pain , vomiting, and fever . Gastroin-
testinal complications that can cause E. coli infections
include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) ischemic coli-"
"include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) ischemic coli-
tis,appendicitis , perforation of the large bowel, and insome instances gangrene in the colon. Other known E.
coli-causing infections may include chronic renal failure,
pancreatitis , and diabetes mellitus . Some neurological
symptoms such as drowsiness, seizure and coma may
occur. In infants, E. coli infections are present in cases of
infantile gastroenteritis and neonatal meningitis.
Strains of E. coli that produce diarrhea were initially
distinguished by their O (somatic) antigens found on thebacterial surface. Although there is an overlap in charac-teristics between strains, they may be classified into fourmain groups; enterohemorrahagic (0157),enteropatho-genic (055,0111), enterotoxigenic (06,078), andenteroinvasive (0124,0164).

"E.coli O157 (VTEC)
The O157:H7 strain is the member of the group most
often associated with a particularly severe form of diar-rhea. (The O indicates the somatic antigen, while the Hdenotes the flagellar antigen, both of which are found onthe cell surface of the bacteria.) The bacterium was dis-covered in 1977, and first reports of infections followed in1982. E. coli O157:H7, as it is frequently referred to by
researchers, causes bloody diarrhea in many infectedpatients. It accounts for about 2% of all cases of diarrheain the western world, and at least one-third of cases ofhemorrhagic colitis, or about 20,000 cases per year
E. coli O157:H7 is also the most common cause of
unique syndromes, known as the Hemolytic-Uremic
Syndrome (HUS) and thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP),
which causes kidney failure, hemolytic anemia , and
thrombocytopenia . Usually, infection with this strain of"
"thrombocytopenia . Usually, infection with this strain of
bacteria will subside without further complications.However, about 5% of people who are infected willdevelop HUS/TTP. This infection also accounts for themajority of episodes of HUS, especially in children.
This strain of bacteria produces a potent toxin called
verotoxin, named for toxin’s ability to kill green monkeykidney or “vero” cells. Bacteria that produce verotoxinare referred to as Verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC).
The numbers of bacteria that are necessary to reproduceinfectious levels of bacteria are quite small, estimated at10-100 viable bacteria. These toxins are lethal for intesti-nal cells and those that line vessels (endothelial cells),inhibiting protein synthesis causing cell death . It is"
"believed that the damage to blood vessels results in theformation of clots, which eventually leads to theHemolytic-Uremic Syndrome. HUS/TTP is a serious,often fatal, syndrome that has other causes in addition toE. coli O157:H7; it is characterized by the breaking up of
red blood cells (hemolysis) and kidney failure (uremia).The syndrome occurs most often in the very young andvery old.

poultry, and outbreaks have of disease have been associ-ated with cattle and bovine products. There are reports ofcontamination from unpasteurized apple juice, hamburg-er meat, radish sprouts, lettuce, and potatoes, as well asother food sources. Environmental contamination mayoccur in water drained from cattle pastures or water con-taining human sewage used for drinking or swimming.Human to human transmission, through contact withfecal matter, has also been identified in daycare centers.

"After an incubation period of three to four days on
average, watery diarrhea begins, which rapidly progressesto bloody diarrhea in many victims, in which case thebowel movement may be mostly blood. Nausea, vomit-ing, and low-grade fever are also frequently present. Gas-trointestinal symptoms last for about one week, andrecovery is often spontaneous. Symptomatic infectionmay occur in about 10% of infected individuals. About 5-10% of individuals, usually at the extremes of age or ele-vated leukocyte count, develop HUS/TTP, and ultimately,kidney failure. Patients taking antibiotics or medications
for gastric acidity may also be at risk. Neurological symp-toms can also occur as part of HUS/TTP and consist ofseizures, paralysis , and coma. Rectal prolapse may also
be a complication, and in some cases colitis, appendicitis,perforation of the large bowel, and gangrene in the bowel.Systemically, the most prevalent complications of E. coli
157 infections are HUS and TTP."
"157 infections are HUS and TTP.
E. coli non-O157 (VTEC)
These strains of E. coli produce verotoxin, but are
strains other than O157. There have been as many as onehundred different types implicated in the development ofdisease. Strain OH111 was found to be involved in out-
breaks in Australia, Japan, and Italy. The O128, O103,and O55 groups have also been implicated in diarrheaoutbreaks. In Britain, cases of infantile gastroenteritis inmaternity hospitals and neonatal units have been attrib-uted to the E. coli non-0157 group. Many of these organ-
isms have been identified in cattle.
Enterotoxigenic E. coli
Two toxins may be produced by this group, the heat-
labile enterotoxin (LT) that can produce enteritis ininfants, and a heat stable enterotoxin (ST), the action ofwhich has yet to be determined.

Some strains of the enteroinvasive E. coli have been
involved in the development of gastroenteritis in infants.These organisms do not produce and enterotoxin. Thecells of the intestine are affected, with the developmentof symptoms that are typical of a shigellae infection.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of a specific type of infection is depen-
dant upon the characteristics of the particular strain ofthe organism.
E. coli O157:H7 (HUS)
This particular strain of E. coli is suspected when
bloody diarrhea, bloody stools, lack of fever, elevatedleukocyte count, and abdominal tenderness are present.Stool cultures are used to tentatively identify the bacteria.Unfortunately, cultures are often negative or inconclusiveif done after 48 hours of symptoms. Further tests are usu-ally needed, however, for confirmation of infection. Thismay include a full blood count , blood film, and tests to"
"determine urea, electrolyte, and LDH (lactate dehydroge-nase) levels. Damaged red blood cells, and elevated levelsof creatinine, urea, and LDH with a drop in platelet
count may indicate that HUS will develop. Immunomag-
netic separation is now being used for diagnosis as well.
E. coli non-O157 (VTEC)
Diagnosis is often difficult for these types of bacteria,
but production of enterohemolysin (Ehly) is used as anindicator. Other diagnostic tests are used to detect vero-toxins, including ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbentassays), colony immunoblotting, and DNA-based tests.
E. coli 0157 STEC
Methods for detection of this type of bacteria are
under development, including culture growth media

Treatment
Uncomplicated cases of the E. coli O157:H7 the
infection clear up within ten days. It is not certain thatantibiotics are helpful in treating E. coli O157:H7 and
there is some evidence that they may be harmful. Dehy-
dration resulting from diarrhea must be treated with either
Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or intravenous fluids.Anti-motility agents that decrease the intestines’ ability tocontract, should not be used in any patient with bloodydiarrhea. Treatment of HUS, if it develops, involves cor-rection of clotting factors, plasma exchange, and kidney
dialysis . Blood transfusions may be required. Treatment
methods for other E. coli infections are similar. Antibiotics

"are often used in the treatment of E. coli infections, but
their role is controversial. Some antibiotics may enhancethe development of HUS/TTP depending upon theiraction, as well as the use of anti diarrhea medications thatshould be avoided. Phosphoenolpyruvate analogues maybe helpful. Gentamicin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, or beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin may be administered forneonatal meningitis. Antibiotic therapy is further compli-cated by the presence of antibiotic resistant organisms.
Alternative treatment
Studies have been conducted to determine if diar-
rhea symptoms can be reduced by alternative therapiessuch as the consumption of herbal teas, psyllium, andacupuncture . Patients should consult their doctors
before using any alternative treatments, as E. coli can be
life threatening and should be closely monitored.

"Prognosis
In most cases of O157:H7, symptoms last for about a
week and recovery is often spontaneous. Ten percent ofindividuals with E. coli O157:H7 infection develop HUS;
5% of those will die of the disease. Some who recoverfrom HUS will be left with some degree of kidney dam-age and possibly irritable bowel syndrome. Additionally,there is a possibility of chronic E. coli infection.
Infants that develop E. coli infections may be perma-
nently affected. Gastroenteritis may leave the child withlactose intolerance . Neonates developing meningitis from
E. coli strains have a high morbidity and mortality rate

Esophageal atresia
Definition
Esophageal atresia is a serious birth defect in which
the esophagus, the long tube that connects the mouth tothe stomach, is segmented and closed off at any point.This condition usually occurs with tracheoesophageal
fistula , a condition in which the esophagus is improperly
attached to the trachea, the nearby tube that connects thenasal area to the lungs. Esophageal atresia occurs inapproximately 1 in 4,000 live births.
Description
Failure of an unborn child (fetus) to develop proper-
ly results in birth defects . Many of these defects involve
organs that do not function, or function only incidentally,before birth, and, as a result, go undetected until the babyis born. In this case, the digestive tract is unnecessary forfetal growth, since all nutrition comes from the mother
through the placenta and umbilical cord."
"through the placenta and umbilical cord.
During fetal development, the esophagus and the tra-
chea arise from the same original tissue. Normally, thetwo tubes would form separately (differentiate); howev-er, in cases of esphageal atresia and tracheoesophagealfistulas, they do not, resulting in various malformed con-figurations. The most common configuration is the “C”type, in which the upper part of the esophagus abruptlyends in a blind pouch, while the lower part attaches itselfto the trachea. This configuration occurs in 85–90% ofcases. Esophageal atresia without involvement of the tra-chea occurs in only 8% of cases.
Causes and symptoms
The cause of esophageal atresia, like that of most
birth defects, is unknown.

"birth defects, is unknown.
An infant born with this defect will at first appear all
right, swallowing normally. However, the blind pouchwill begin to fill with mucus and saliva that would nor-mally pass through the esophagus to the stomach. Thesesecretions back up into the mouth and nasal area, causingthe baby to drool excessively. When fed, the baby willalso immediately regurgitate what he or she has eaten.Choking and coughing may also occur as the baby
breaths in the fluid backing up from the esophagus. Aspi-ration pneumonia , an infection of the respiratory system
caused by inhalation of the contents of the digestive tract,may also develop.
Diagnosis
Physicians who suspect esophageal atresia after
being presented with the above symptoms diagnose thecondition using x-ray imaging or by passing a catheterthrough the nose and into the esophagus. Esophagealatresia is indicated if the catheter hits an obstruction 4–5in (10–13 cm) from the nostrils."
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1238Esophageal atresiaGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1238
"Treatment
Infants with esophageal atresia are unlikely to survive
without surgery to reconnect the esophagus. The procedureis done as soon as possible; however, prematurity , the
presence of other birth defects, or complications of apira-tion pneumonia may delay surgery. Once diagnosed, thebaby will be fed intraveneously until he or she has recov-ered sufficiently from the operation. Mucus and saliva willalso be continuously removed via a catheter until recoveryhas occured. When surgery is performed, the esophagus isreconnected and, if neccessary, separated from the trachea.If the two ends of the esophagus are too far apart to be reat-tached, tissue from the large intestine is used to join them.

"Prognosis
Surgery to correct esophageal atresia is usually suc-

Description
Esophageal cancer usually originates in the inner
layers of the lining of the esophagus and grows outward.In time, the tumor can obstruct the passage of food andliquid, making swallowing painful and difficult. Sincemost patients are not diagnosed until the late stages ofthe disease, esophageal cancer is associated with poorquality of life and low survival rates.
Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type
of esophageal cancer, accounting for 95% of allesophageal cancers worldwide. The esophagus is nor-mally lined with thin, flat squamous cells that resembletiny roof shingles . Squamous cell carcinoma can develop
at any point along the esophagus but is most common inthe middle portion."
"at any point along the esophagus but is most common inthe middle portion.
Adenocarcinoma has surpassed squamous cell carci-
noma as the most common type of esophageal cancer inthe United States. Adenocarcinoma originates in glandu-lar tissue not normally present in the lining of the esoph-agus. Before adenocarcinoma can develop, glandularcells must replace a section of squamous cells. Thisoccurs in Barrett’s esophagus, a precancerous conditionin which chronic acid reflux from the stomach stimulatesa transformation in cell type in the lower portion of theesophagus.
A very small fraction of esophageal cancers are
melanomas, sarcomas , or lymphomas.

"melanomas, sarcomas , or lymphomas.
There is great variability in the incidence of
esophageal cancer with regard to geography, ethnicity,and gender. The overall incidence is increasing. About13,000 new cases of esophageal cancer are diagnosed inthe United States each year. During the same 12-monthperiod, 12,000 people die of this disease. It strikesbetween five and ten North Americans per 100,000. Insome areas of China the cancer is endemic.
Squamous cell carcinoma usually occurs in the sixth
or seventh decade of life, with a greater incidence inAfrican-Americans than in others. Adenocarcinomadevelops earlier and is much more common in whitepatients. In general, esophageal cancer occurs more fre-quently in men than in women.
Causes and symptoms
The exact cause of esophageal cancer is unknown,
although many investigators believe that chronic irrita-tion of the esophagus is a major culprit. Most of the iden-tified risk factors represent a form of chronic irritation."

"However, the wide variance in the distribution of
esophageal cancer among different demographic groupsraises the possibility that genetic factors also play a role.
Several risk factors are associated with esophageal
cancer.
• Tobacco and alcohol consumption are the major risk
factors, especially for squamous cell carcinoma. Smok-
ingand alcohol abuse each increase the risk of squa-
mous cell carcinoma by five-fold. The effects of thetwo are synergistic, in that the combination of smokingand alchohol increases the risk by 25- to 100- fold. It isestimated that drinking about 13 ounces of alcoholevery day for an extended period of time raises the riskof developing esophageal cancer by 18%. That likeli-hood increases to 44% in individuals who also smokeone or two packs of cigarettes a day. Smokeless tobaccoalso increases the risk for esophageal cancer.
• Gastroesophageal reflux is a condition in which acid"
"• Gastroesophageal reflux is a condition in which acid
from the stomach refluxes backwards into the lowerportion of the esophagus, sometimes causing symptomsof heartburn . In some cases of gastroesophageal
reflux, the chronic exposure to acid causes the inner lin-ing of the lower esophagus to change from squamouscells to glandular cells. This is called Barrett’s esopha-gus. Patients with Barrett’s esophagus are roughly 30 to40 times more likely than the general population todevelop adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.
• A diet low in fruits, vegetables, zinc, riboflavin, and
other vitamins can increase risk of developing to
esophageal cancer.
• Caustic injury to the esophagus inflicted by swallowing
lye or other substances that damage esophageal cells canlead to the development of squamous cell esophagealcancer in later life.
• Achalasia is a condition in which the lower esophageal"
"• Achalasia is a condition in which the lower esophageal
sphincter (muscle) cannot relax enough to let food passinto the stomach. Squamous cell esophageal cancerdevelops in about 6% of patients with achalasia.
• Tylosis is a rare inherited disease characterized by
excess skin on the palms and soles. Affected patientshave a much higher probability of developingesophageal cancer than the general population. Theyshould have regular screenings to detect the disease inits early, most curable stages.
• Esophageal webs, which are protrusions of tissue into
the esophagus, and diverticula, which are outpouchingsof the wall of the esophagus, are associated with a high-er incidence of esophageal cancer.Symptoms
Unfortunately, symptoms generally don’t appear"
"Unfortunately, symptoms generally don’t appear
until the tumor has grown so large that the patient cannotbe cured. Dysphagia (trouble swallowing or a sensationof having food stuck in the throat or chest) is the mostcommon symptom. Swallowing problems may occuroccasionally at first, and patients often react by eatingmore slowly and chewing their food more carefully and,as the tumor grows, switching to soft foods or a liquiddiet. Without treatment, the tumor will eventually pre-vent even liquid from passing into the stomach. A sensa-tion of burning or slight mid-chest pressure is a rare,often-disregarded symptom of esophageal cancer.Painful swallowing is usually a symptom of a largetumor obstructing the opening of the esophagus. It canlead to regurgitation of food, weight loss, physical wast-ing, and malnutrition . Anyone who has trouble swal-
lowing, loses a significant amount of weight withoutdieting, or cannot eat solid food because it is too painfulto swallow should see a doctor."
"Diagnosis
A barium swallow is usually the first test performed"
"on a patient whose symptoms suggest esophageal cancer.After the patient swallows a small amount of barium, aseries of x rays can highlight any bumps or flat raisedareas on the normally smooth surface of the esophagealwall. It can also detect large, irregular areas that narrowthe esophagus in patients with advanced cancer, but it can-not provide information about disease that has spreadbeyond the esophagus. A double contrast study is a bariumswallow with air blown into the esophagus to improve theway the barium coats the esophageal lining. Endoscopy isa diagnostic procedure in which a thin lighted tube (endo-scope) is passed through the mouth, down the throat, andinto the esophagus. Cells that appear abnormal areremoved for biopsy. Once a diagnosis of esophageal can-cer has been confirmed through biopsy, staging tests areperformed to determine whether the disease has spread(metastasized) to tissues or organs near the original tumoror in other parts of the body.

"laparoscopy , and positron emission tomography .
Treatment
Treatment for esophageal cancer is determined by the
stage of the disease and the patient’s general health. Themost important distinction to make is whether the canceris curable. If the cancer is in the early stages, cure may bepossible. If the cancer is advanced or if the patient willnot tolerate major surgery, treatment is usually directed atpalliation (relief of symptoms only) instead of cure.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1240Esophageal cancerGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1240"
"Staging
Stage 0 is the earliest stage of the disease. Cancer
cells are confined to the innermost lining of the esopha-gus. Stage I esophageal cancer has spread slightly deep-er, but still has not extended to nearby tissues, lymphnodes, or other organs. In Stage IIA, cancer has invadedthe thick, muscular layer of the esophagus that propelsfood into the stomach and may involve connective tissuecovering the outside of the esophagus. In Stage IIB, can-cer has spread to lymph nodes near the esophagus andmay have invaded deeper layers of esophageal tissue.Stage III esophageal cancer has spread to tissues orlymph nodes near the esophagus or to the trachea (wind-pipe) or other organs near the esophagus. Stage IV can-cer has spread to distant organs like the liver, bones, andbrain. Recurrent esophageal cancer is disease that devel-ops in the esophagus or another part of the body after ini-tial treatment.

"Surgery
The most common operations for the treatment of
esophageal cancer are esophagectomy and esophagogas-trectomy. Esophagectomy is the removal of the cancer-ous part of the esophagus and nearby lymph nodes. Thisprocedure is performed only on patients with very earlycancer that has not spread to the stomach. Esophagogas-trectomy is the removal of the cancerous part of theesophagus, nearby lymph nodes, and the upper part ofthe stomach. The resected esophagus is replaced with thestomach or parts of intestine so the patient can swallow.These procedures can significantly relieve symptoms andimprove the nutritional status of more than 80% ofpatients with dysphagia. Although surgery can cure somepatients whose disease has not spread beyond the esoph-agus, but more than 75% of esophageal cancers havespread to other organs before being diagnosed. Lessextensive surgical procedures can be used for palliation.

"Chemotherapy
Oral or intravenous chemotherapy alone will not
cure esophageal cancer, but pre-operative treatments canshrink tumors and increase the probability that cancercan be surgically eradicated. Palliative chemotherapy canrelieve symptoms of advanced cancer but will not alterthe outcome of the disease.
Radiation
External beam or internal radiation, delivered by
machine or implanted near cancer cells inside the body,is only rarely used as the primary form of treatment.Post-operative radiation is sometimes used to kill cancercells that couldn’t be surgically removed. Palliative radi-ation is effective in relieving dysphagia in patients who
cannot be cured. However, radiation is most useful whencombined with chemotherapy as either the definitivetreatment or preoperative treatment.
Palliation

"Palliation
In addition to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation,
other palliative measures can provide symptomatic relief.Dilatation of the narrowed portion of the esophagus withsoft tubes can provide short-term relief of dysphagia. Place-ment of a flexible, self-expanding stent within the narrowedportion is also useful in allowing more food intake.
Follow-up treatments
Regular barium swallows and other imaging studies
are necessary to detect recurrence or spread of disease ornew tumor development.
Alternative treatment
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves intravenously
injecting a drug that is absorbed by cancer cells and killsthem after they are exposed to specific laser beams. PDTcan be used for palliation, but it also cured some earlyesophageal cancers during preliminary studies.Researchers are comparing its benefits with those ofmore established therapies.

"Endoscopic laser therapy involves delivering short,
powerful laser treatments to the tumor through an endo-scope. It can improve dysphagia, but multiple treatmentsare required, and the benefit is seldom long-lasting.

than half of all patients are candidates for curative treat-ment. Even if cure is attempted, the cancer can recur.

Esophageal function tests
Definition
The esophagus is the swallowing tube through
which food passes on its way from the mouth to thestomach. The main function of this organ is to propelfood down into the stomach. There is also a mechanismto prevent food from coming back up or “refluxing” fromthe stomach into the esophagus. Esophageal functiontests are used to determine if these processes are normalor abnormal.
Purpose
The esophagus is a long, muscular tube that also has
two muscles (or sphincters) at the top and bottom. All ofthese muscular areas must contract in an exact sequencefor swallowing to proceed normally. There are threemain symptoms that occur when esophageal function isabnormal: difficulty with swallowing (dysphagia), heart-
burn , and chest pain .
Doctors perform a variety of tests to evaluate these"
"burn , and chest pain .
Doctors perform a variety of tests to evaluate these
symptoms. Endoscopy, which is not a test of esophagealfunction, is often used to determine if the lining of theesophagus has any ulcers, tumors, or areas of narrowing(strictures). Many times, however, endoscopy only showsthe doctor if there is injury to the esophageal lining, andthe procedure gives no information about the cause of theproblem.
Therefore, in addition to endoscopy, several studies
are available that measure esophageal function. There arethree basic types of tests used to assess esophageal func-tion:
• Manometry is used to study the way the muscles of the
esophagus contract, and is most useful for the investi-gation of difficulty with swallowing.
• Esophageal pH monitoring measures changes in
esophageal acidity, and is valuable for evaluatingpatients with heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux dis-ease (GERD).
• X-ray studies investigate swallowing difficulties. They"
"• X-ray studies investigate swallowing difficulties. They
either follow the progress of barium during swallowingusing a fluoroscope, or they use radioactive scanningtechniques.

"Precautions
Pregnant patients undergoing x-ray exams should
carefully review the risks and benefits with their doctors.Most x-ray exams of the gastrointestinal tract do notinvolve radiation levels that are harmful to the unborn baby.
Description
Manometry
This study is designed to measure the pressure
changes produced by contraction of the muscular por-tions of the esophagus. An abnormality in the function ofany one of the segments of the swallowing tube causesdifficulty in swallowing. Doctors call this symptom dys-phagia. This exam is most useful in evaluating thosepatients whose endoscopy is negative.
During manometry, the patient swallows a thin tube"
"During manometry, the patient swallows a thin tube
carrying a device that senses changes in pressures in theesophagus. Readings are taken at rest and during swal-lowing. Medications are sometimes given during thestudy to help in the diagnosis. The results are then trans-mitted to recording equipment. Manometry can bestidentify diseases that produce disturbances of motility orcontractions of the esophagus.
Esophageal pH monitoring
This procedure involves measuring the esophagus’
exposure to acid that has “refluxed” from the stomach.The test is ideal for evaluating recurring heartburn orGERD. Too much acid produces not only heartburn, butalso ulcers that can bleed or produce areas of narrowing(strictures) when they heal.
Normally, acid refluxes into the esophagus in only"
"Normally, acid refluxes into the esophagus in only
small amounts for short periods of time. A muscle calledthe lower esophageal sphincter prevents excessive reflux.Spontaneous contractions that increase esophageal emp-tying and production of saliva are other important protec-tive mechanisms.
“pH” is the scientific term that tells just how acidic or
alkaline a substance is. Researchers have shown that in theesophagus, the presence of acid is damaging only if it per-sists for prolonged periods. Therefore, the test has beendesigned to monitor the level of acidity over 24 hours, usu-ally in the home. In this way, patients maintain their dailyroutine, documenting their symptoms, and at what point intheir activities they occurred. During this period, a thintube with a pH monitor remains in the esophagus to recordchanges. After the study, a computer is used to comparechanges in acidity with symptoms reported by the patient.
Surgery is an effective and long-lasting treatment for"
"Surgery is an effective and long-lasting treatment for
symptoms of recurrent reflux and is the choice of manypatients and doctors. pH monitoring is usually performed
before surgery to confirm the diagnosis and to judge theeffects of drug therapy.
X-ray tests
These fall into two categories: (1) those done with
the use of barium and a fluoroscope; and (2) those per-formed with radioactive materials.
Studies performed with fluoroscopy are of greatest
value in identifying a structural abnormality of the esoph-agus. Although this is not truly an esophageal functiontest, it does allow doctors to consider other diagnosticpossibilities. Often a sandwich or marshmallow coatedwith barium is used to identify the site of an obstruction.
During fluoroscopy, the radiologist can observe the"
"During fluoroscopy, the radiologist can observe the
passage of material through the esophagus in real time,and video recordings can also be done. This is particularlyuseful when the swallowing symptoms appear to involvemainly the upper region of the esophagus. The most com-mon cause of swallowing difficulties is a previous stroke ,
although other diseases of the neuromuscular system (likemyasthenia gravis ) can produce the same symptoms.
Scans using low-dose radioactive materials are use-
ful because they are able not only to demonstrate thatfood passes through the esophagus more slowly than nor-mal, but also how slow. These studies involve swallow-ing food coated with material that is followed by anuclear medicine scanner. Scans are best used whenother methods have failed to make a diagnosis, or if it isnecessary to determine the degree of the abnormality. Asof 1997, scans mainly served as research tools.
Preparation
Patients should not eat or drink for several hours"
"Preparation
Patients should not eat or drink for several hours
before the exam. Many medications affect the esopha-gus; doses sometimes need to be adjusted or evenstopped for a while. Patients must inform doctors of allmedications taken, including over-the-counter medica-tions (purchased without a doctor’s prescription), andany known allergies .
Aftercare
For most of these studies, no special care is needed
after the procedure. Patients can often go about normaldaily activities following any of these tests. One excep-tion is for those who undergo an x-ray exam with the useof barium. This can have a constipating effect andpatients should ask about using a mild laxative later on.
Risks
Exposure of a fetus to x rays, especially in the first
three months, is a potential risk.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1243Esophageal function testsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1243"
"Other studies of esophageal function are essen-
tially free of any significant risk. The tubes passedduring these procedures are small, and most patientsadjust to them quite well. However, since medicationscannot be used to relax patients, some may not toleratethe exam.
Abnormal results
Manometry is used to diagnose abnormalities relat-
ed to contraction or relaxation of the various muscularregions of the esophagus. These studies cannot distin-guish whether injury to either the muscle or nerves of theesophagus is producing the abnormal results. Only thefinal effect on esophageal muscle is identified. Resultsshould be interpreted in light of the patient’s entire med-ical history.
For example, there are many diseases that cause
poor relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. Whenno cause is found, the disease is called achalasia .
Abnormal results of pH tests can confirm symptoms"
"Abnormal results of pH tests can confirm symptoms
of heartburn or indicate a cause of chest pain (or rarely,swallowing difficulties). Doctors may want to start orchange medications based on these results, or even repeatthe test using different doses of medication. As notedabove, these studies are indicated before surgical treat-ment of GERD.
X-ray tests can only serve to document an abnormal-
ity, and they are far from perfect. If they are negative,then other studies are often needed.

Definition
Esophageal pouches, also known as esophageal
diverticula, are pocket-like structures formed when theinterior space of the esophagus, the tube that connectsthe mouth to the stomach, protrudes into the walls thatsurround it.
Description
The esophagus is a muscular tube that propels food
into the stomach. A defect in the wall of the esophagusmay allow the lining to herniate, creating a space wherefood can be caught. Pouches can appear anywherebetween the throat and the stomach. They occur primari-ly in men and usually later in life.
Different names for the condition apply to different
locations along the esophagus:
• Zenker’s diverticula are pharyngeal pouches, or ones
that occur in the upper neck area at the top of the esoph-agus."
"that occur in the upper neck area at the top of the esoph-agus.
•Traction diverticula are a type of mid-esophageal
pouch.
• Epiphrenic diverticula occur at the bottom of the esoph-
agus near where it enters the stomach.
Causes and symptoms
To propel food into the stomach (or out of it during
vomiting) the esophagus generates internal pressure justlike the bowel. Under certain circumstances, that pressurecan herniate the esophageal lining through a weakness inthe wall, creating a pouch (a balloon squeezed in the handwill herniate through the fingers in the same way). Pouch-es are more common in people who have motility disor-ders of the esophagus, swallowing that is not well coordi-nated and may be spastic. A traction diverticulum candevelop from a scar that pulls the esophagus out of shape.Food and saliva can collect in all of these pouches.

"Pouches in the neck usually cause bad breath (hali-
tosis) and the regurgitation of swallowed food and saliva.Some patients with Zenker’s diverticula can push on theirneck and make old food appear in their mouths. Pouchesnear the stomach may cause swallowing problems, condi-tions known as achalasia or dysphagia . Mid-esophageal
pouches usually cause no symptoms.
In the most serious cases, a person may be unable to
swallow because the esophagus is obstructed, or theesphagus may rupture, spilling its contents into the chestor neck.

lowing a contrast agent usually demonstrates the divertic-ulum clearly. An esophagoscopy may also be needed togather more detail. Manometry, measuring pressuresinside the esophagus using a balloon that is passed downit, may help determine the cause of the diverticula.

"Treatment
Treatment for this condition is primarily aimed at
alleviating symptoms. Physicians direct the patient to eata bland diet, to chew his or her food thoroughly, and todrink water after eating to clean out the pouches. If thecondition is severe, several types of surgery are availableto remove the pouches and repair the defects. If a pouchis due to a stenosis (narrowing) in the esophagus it maybe possible to relieve it by passing a dilator through it, aprocess called bougeinage.

The two complications that can render these nui-
sances dangerous, obstruction and rupture, are emergen-cies. Both require immediate medical attention. Other

"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
Definition
An endoscope as used in the field of gastroenterolo-
gy (the medical study of the stomach and intestines) is athin, flexible tube that uses a lens or miniature camera toview various areas of the gastrointestinal tract. When theprocedure is limited to the examination of the inside ofthe gastrointestinal tract’s upper portion, it is calledupper endoscopy or esphagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).With the endoscope, the esophagus (swallowing tube),stomach, and duodenum (first portion of the small intes-tine) can be easily examined, and abnormalities frequent-ly treated. Patients are usually sedated during the exam.
Purpose
EGD is performed to evaluate or treat symptoms
relating to the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as:
• upper abdominal or chest pain
• nausea or vomiting
• difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
• bleeding from the upper intestinal tract
• anemia (low blood count ). EGD can be used to treat"
"• bleeding from the upper intestinal tract
• anemia (low blood count ). EGD can be used to treat
certain conditions, such as an area of narrowing orbleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract
Upper endoscopy is more accurate than x rays for
detecting inflammation, ulcers, or tumors. It is used todiagnose early cancer and can frequently determine
whether a growth is benign (not cancerous) or malignant(cancerous).Biopsies (small tissue samples) of inflamed or “sus-
picious” areas can be obtained and examined by a pathol-ogist. Cell scrapings can also be taken by the introduc-tion of a small brush; this helps in the diagnosis of canceror infections.
When treating conditions in the upper gastrointesti-
nal tract, small instruments are passed through the endo-scope that can stretch narrowed areas (strictures), orremove swallowed objects (such as coins or pins). Inaddition, bleeding from ulcers or vessels can be treatedby a number of endoscopic techniques."
"Recent studies have shown the usefulness of endo-
scopic removal of early tumors of the esophagus or stom-ach. This is done either with injection of certain materi-als (like alcohol), or with the use of instruments (likelasers) that burn the tumor. Other techniques combiningmedications and lasers also show promise.
Precautions
Patients should inquire as to the doctor’s expertise
with these procedures, especially when therapy is themain goal. The doctor should be informed of any aller-
gies, medication use, and medical problems.

The lens or cam-era at the end of the instrument allows the endoscopist toexamine each portion of the upper gastrointestinal tract;photos can be taken for reference. Air is pumped inthrough the instrument to allow proper observation.Biopsies and other procedures can be performed withoutany significant discomfort.

"Preparation
The upper intestinal tract must be empty for the pro-
cedure, so it is necessary NOT to eat or drink for at least6–12 hours before the exam. Patients need to inquireabout taking their medications before the procedure.
Aftercare
Someone should be available to take the person
home after the procedure and stay with them for a while;patients will not be able to drive themselves due to seda-
tion. Pain or any other unusual symptoms should be
reported immediately.
It is important to recognize early signs of any possi-
ble complication. The doctor should be notified if thepatient has fever , trouble swallowing, or increasing
throat, chest, or abdominal pain.
Risks
EGD is safe and well tolerated; however, complica-
tions can occur as with any procedure. These are mostoften due to medications used during the procedure, or"
"are related to endoscopic therapy. The overall complica-tion rate of EGD is less than 2%, and many of these com-plications are minor (such as inflammation of the veinthrough which medication is given). However, seriousones can and do occur, and almost half of them are relat-ed to the heart or lungs. Bleeding or perforations (holesin the gastrointestinal tract) are also reported, especiallywhen tumors or narrowed areas are treated or biopsied.Infections have also been rarely transmitted; improvedcleaning techniques should be able to prevent them.

"Purpose
Nerves convey information to the body by sending
electrical signals down the length of the nerve. These sig-nals can be recorded by wires placed over the nerves onthe surface of the skin, in a procedure called an evokedpotential (EP) study. The person conducting the testevokes the patient’s neural activity by visual or auditorystimulation or using a mild electrical shock. This causeschanges in the electrical potential in the nerves. Analysisof the signals can provide information about the condi-tion of nerve pathways, especially those in the brain andspinal cord. They can indicate the presence of disease ordegeneration, and can help determine the location ofnerve lesions.
There are three major types of EP studies used regu-
larly:
• Visual evoked potentials are used to diagnose visual
losses due to optic nerve damage, especially from mul-
tiple sclerosis . They are also useful to diagnose “hys-"
"tiple sclerosis . They are also useful to diagnose “hys-
terical blindness,” in which loss of vision is not due toany nerve damage.• Auditory evoked potentials are used to diagnose hearing
losses. They can distinguish damage to the acoustic nerve(which carries signals from the ear to the brain stem)from damage to the auditory pathways within the brain-stem. Most auditory EPs record activity from the brain-stem, and are therefore called “brainstem auditory evokedpotentials.” Disorders diagnosed with auditory EPsinclude acoustic neuroma (tumors of the inner ear) and
multiple sclerosis (chronic disease in which nerves losepatches of their outer covering). They may also be used toassess high frequency hearing ability, to determine braindeath , and to monitor brainstem function during surgery

"• Somatosensory evoked potentials record transmission of
nerve impulses from the limbs to the brain, and can beused to diagnose nerve damage or degeneration withinthe spinal cord or nerve roots from multiple sclerosis,trauma, or other degenerative disease. SomatosensoryEPs can be used to distinguish central versus peripheralnerve disease, when combined with results from a nerveconduction velocity test, which measures nerve functionin the extremities.
Precautions
Evoked potential studies are painless, noninvasive,
and without any significant risk. Somatosensory EP testsinvolve very mild electric shocks, usually felt as a tingling.

"Description
The person performing the test locates and marks
specific spots on the patient’s head for placement of elec-trodes. These spots are cleaned, and an adhesive conduct-ing paste is applied. Cup electrodes are attached. Forsomatosensory EP, spots on the arm or leg are alsomarked and cleaned; electrodes may be taped in place.The patient sits or reclines in a chair throughout the tests.
For a visual EP, the patient focuses on a TV screen
which displays a checkerboard pattern. The eye not beingtested is covered with a patch. For children or otherswhose attention may wander, goggles are used whichshow the pattern to one eye at a time. Each eye is usuallytested twice, and the entire procedure takes approximate-ly 30–45 minutes.
For auditory EP, headphones are used to deliver a
series of clicks to one ear at a time. A masking or staticsound is played into the other ear. Each ear is usuallytested twice, and the entire procedure takes approximate-ly 30–45 minutes."
"For somatosensory EP, mild electrical shocks are
delivered to the arm or leg. This may cause some twitch-ing and tingling. The stimulus lasts for about two min-utes at a time, and the entire procedure takes approxi-mately 30 minutes.

"After the tests, the electrodes are removed with ace-
tone and the scalp is cleaned.
Preparation
Hair must be clean, dry, and free of any braids, pins,
or jewelry. The patient should shampoo before the test,and must not use any hair spray, gel, or other hair careproducts after shampooing. Clothing should be loose andcomfortable. The patient may eat and take some medica-tions as usual before the test, although sedative medica-tions should be avoided on the day of the test, if possible.It is best to check with the physician supervising the testfor specific instructions.
Aftercare
This test is painless and has no residual effects. The
patient may return to work or other activities immediate-ly afterward.
Normal results
EP test results are displayed as jagged electrical
tracings (wave forms), which have characteristic shapes,heights, and lengths, indicating the speed and intensity ofsignal transmission. Results are read by someone trainedin evoked potential studies.
Abnormal results"
"Abnormal results
Changes in the electrical tracings may indicate dam-
age to or degeneration of nerve pathways to the brainfrom the eyes, ears, or limbs. Absence of any activitymay mean complete loss of nerve function in that path-way. Other changes may provide evidence of the typeand location of nerve damage.

"Exercise
Definition
Exercise is physical activity that is planned, struc-
tured, and repetitive for the purpose of conditioning anypart of the body. Exercise is utilized to improve health,maintain fitness and is important as a means of physicalrehabilitation .
Purpose
Exercise is useful in preventing or treating coronary
heart disease, osteoporosis , weakness, diabetes, obesity ,
and depression. Range of motion is one aspect of exerciseimportant for increasing or maintaining joint function.Strengthening exercises provide appropriate resistance tothe muscles to increase endurance and strength. Cardiac
rehabilitation exercises are developed and individualized
to improve the cardiovascular system for prevention andrehabilitation of cardiac disorders and diseases. A well-balanced exercise program can improve general health,build endurance, and delay many of the effects of aging .
The benefits of exercise not only improve physical health,but also enhance emotional well-being.
Precautions"
"Precautions
Before beginning any exercise program, an evalua-
tion by a physician is recommended to rule out any poten-tial health risks. Once health and fitness are determined,and any or all physical restrictions identified, an individ-ual’s exercise program should be under the supervision ofa health care professional. This is especially the casewhen exercise is used as a form of rehabilitation. If symp-toms of dizziness , nausea, excessive shortness of breath ,
or chest pain are present during any exercise program, an
individual should stop the activity and inform a physicianabout these symptoms before resuming activity. Exerciseequipment must be checked to determine if it can bear theweight of people of all sizes and shapes.
Description
Range of motion exercise
Range of motion exercise refers to activity whose
goal is improving movement of a specific joint. This

of bone surfaces within the joint, joint capsule, liga-ments, and muscles and tendons acting on the joint.There are three types of range of motion exercises: pas-sive, active, and active assists. Passive range of motion ismovement applied to a joint solely by another person orpersons or a passive motion machine. When passiverange of motion is applied, the joint of an individualreceiving exercise is completely relaxed while the out-side force moves the body part, such as a leg or arm,throughout the available range.

"bilization of a joint may affect the normal joint range of
motion. Active range of motion is movement of a jointprovided entirely by the individual performing the exer-cise. In this case, there is no outside force aiding in themovement. Active assist range of motion is described asa joint receiving partial assistance from an outside force.This range of motion may result from the majority ofmotion applied by an exerciser or by the person or per-sons assisting the individual. It may also be a half-and-half effort on the joint from each source.
Strengthening exercise
Strengthening exercise increases muscle strength
and mass, bone strength, and the body’s metabolism. Itcan help attain and maintain proper weight and improvebody image and self-esteem. A certain level of musclestrength is needed to do daily activities, such as walking,"
"running and climbing stairs. Strengthening exercisesincrease this muscle strength by putting more strain on amuscle than it is normally accustomed to receiving. Thisincreased load stimulates the growth of proteins insideeach muscle cell that allow the muscle as a whole to con-tract. There is evidence indicating that strength trainingmay be better than aerobic exercise alone for improvingself-esteem and body image. Weight training allows oneimmediate feedback, through observation of progress inmuscle growth and improved muscle tone. Strengtheningexercise can take the form of isometric, isotonic and iso-kinetic strengthening.
ISOMETRIC EXERCISE. During isometric exercises,"
"ISOMETRIC EXERCISE. During isometric exercises,
muscles contract. However, there is no motion in theaffected joints. The muscle fibers maintain a constantlength throughout the entire contraction. The exercisesare usually performed against an immovable surface orobject such as pressing one’s hand against a wall. Themuscles of the arm are contracting but the wall is notreacting or moving as a result of the physical effort. Iso-metric training is effective for developing total strengthof a particular muscle or group of muscles. It is oftenused for rehabilitation since the exact area of muscleweakness can be isolated and strengthening can beadministered at the proper joint angle. This kind of train-ing can provide a relatively quick and convenient method

"for overloading and strengthening muscles without any
special equipment and with little chance of injury.
ISOTONIC EXERCISE. Isotonic exercise differs from
isometric exercise in that there is movement of a jointduring the muscle contraction. A classic example of anisotonic exercise is weight training with dumbbells andbarbells. As the weight is lifted throughout the range ofmotion, the muscle shortens and lengthens. Calisthenicsare also an example of isotonic exercise. These wouldinclude chin-ups, push-ups, and sit-ups, all of which usebody weight as the resistance force.

"ISOKINETIC EXERCISE. Isokinetic exercise utilizes
machines that control the speed of contraction within therange of motion. Isokinetic exercise attempts to combinethe best features of both isometrics and weight training.It provides muscular overload at a constant preset speedwhile a muscle mobilizes its force through the full rangeof motion. For example, an isokinetic stationary bicycleset at 90 revolutions per minute means that despite howhard and fast the exerciser works, the isokinetic proper-ties of the bicycle will allow the exerciser to pedal onlyas fast as 90 revolutions per minute. Machines known asCybex and Biodex provide isokinetic results; they aregenerally used by physical therapists and are not readilyavailable to the general population.

"Cardiac rehabilitation
Exercise can be very helpful in prevention and
rehabilitation of cardiac disorders and disease. With anindividually designed exercise program set at a levelconsidered safe for that individual, people with symp-toms of heart failure can substantially improve their
fitness levels. The greatest benefit occurs as musclesimprove the efficiency of their oxygen use, whichreduces the need for the heart to pump as much blood.While such exercise doesn’t appear to improve the con-dition of the heart itself, the increased fitness levelreduces the total workload of the heart. The relatedincrease in endurance should also translate into a gener-ally more active lifestyle. Endurance or aerobic rou-tines, such as running, brisk walking, cycling, or swim-ming, increase the strength and efficiency of the mus-cles of the heart.

"Preparation
A physical examination by a physician is important
to determine if strenuous exercise is appropriate or detri-mental for an individual. Prior to the exercise program,proper stretching is important to prevent the possibilityof soft tissue injury resulting from tight muscles, ten-dons, ligaments, and other joint-related structures.KEY TERMS

"Aftercare
Proper cool down after exercise is important in
reducing the occurrence of painful muscle spasms. It hasbeen documented that proper cool down may alsodecrease frequency and intensity of muscle stiffness theday following any exercise program.

Improper warm up can lead to muscle strains.
Overexertion with not enough time between exercise ses-sions to recuperate can also lead to muscle strains, result-ing in inactivity due to pain. Stress fractures are also a
possibility if activities are strenuous over long periods oftime without proper rest. Although exercise is safe for themajority of children and adults, there is still a need forfurther studies to identify potential risks.

Exophthalmos
Definition
When there is an increase in the volume of the tissue
behind the eyes, the eyes will appear to bulge out of theface. The terms exophthalmos and proptosis apply. Prop-tosis can refer to any organ that is displaced forward,while exophthalmos refers just to the eyes.
Description
The eye socket (orbit) is made of bone and therefore
will not yield to increased pressure within it. Only for-ward displacement of the eyeball (globe) will allow moreroom if tissue behind the eye is increasing.
Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of exophthalmos is"
"Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of exophthalmos is
Graves’ disease, overactivity of the thyroid gland. Thecontents of the orbits swell due to inflammation, forcingthe eyes forward. The inflammation affects primarily themuscles. This combination of muscle impairment andforward displacement reduces eye movement, causingdouble vision and crossed eyes ( strabismus ). The optic
nerves can also be affected, reducing vision, and theclear membrane (conjunctiva) covering the white part ofthe eyes and lining the inside of the eyelids can swell.Finally, the eyes may protrude so far that the eyelids can-not close over them, leading to corneal damage.
Exophthalmos from Graves’ disease is bilateral
(occurring on both sides), but not necessarily symmetri-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1252ExophthalmosGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1252"
"cal. In contrast, exophthalmos from orbital tumors or a
blood clot in the brain happens on only one side.
Diagnosis
Exophthalmos is obvious when it is advanced
enough to cause complications. When there is doubt inthe early stages, a mechanical device called an exoph-thalmometer can measure the protrusion. Computed
tomography scans (CT scans) are of great value in
examining the bony components of the orbit. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scanning is equally valuable
for displaying the contents of the orbit, because it “seesthrough” the bone.
Treatment
If a tumor is growing behind the eye, it needs to be
removed. If Graves’ disease is the cause, it may subsidewith treatment of the overactive thyroid, but this is notguaranteed. Local care to the front of the eye to keep itmoist is necessary if the eyelid cannot close.
Prognosis
Exophthalmos can be progressive. Its progress must
be carefully followed, treating complications as theyoccur.
Prevention"
"be carefully followed, treating complications as theyoccur.
Prevention
Vision can usually be preserved with attentive treat-
ment. There is currently no way to prevent any of theunderlying conditions that lead to exophthalmos.Resources

"Purpose
The external sphincter muscle is the ring-like muscle
that controls urine release from the bladder. When apatient cannot voluntarily control urination (inconti-nence), a physician may order this test to determine if theproblem is caused by the failure of this muscle. The vol-untary contraction or release of a muscle such as theexternal sphincter involves a complex process in whichthe nerves controlling the muscle signal it to movethrough the release and uptake of chemicals called neu-rotransmitters and the generation of electrical impulses.This test records the electrical impulses given off whenthe muscle contracts or relaxes and allows the physicianto determine if the muscle is working properly, if it hasbeen damaged by disease, or some other condition.

Once the electrodes are in place and attached to the
recording device, the patient is asked to alternately con-tract and relax the external sphincter muscle. The electri-cal activity generated during these contractions and relax-ations is recorded on a graph called an electromyogram.
Preparation
Before the test, the patient should discuss with the
doctor whether it is necessary to temporarily discontinueany medications, and follow the doctor’s orders. Nochanges in diet or activity are necessary.
Aftercare
Women may see some blood in their urine the first time
they urinate after the test. Blood in the urine of men or bloodin the urine of women after the first urination should bereported the doctor. The patient should take a warm bath anddrink plenty of fluids to ease any discomfort after the test.

Abnormal results
A diseased external sphincter muscle will produce
an abnormal pattern of electrical activity. Conditions thataffect the external sphincter may include multiple scle-
rosis ,neurogenic bladder ,Parkinson’s disease ,spinal
cord injury , and stress incontinence. However, addi-
tional tests must be done in order to confirm any of thesediagnoses.

Extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation
Definition
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a
special procedure that uses an artificial heart-lungmachine to take over the work of the lungs (and some-times also the heart). ECMO is used most often in new-borns and young children, but it also can be used as a lastresort for adults whose heart or lungs are failing."
"Purpose
In newborns, ECMO is used to support or replace an
infant’s undeveloped or failing lungs by providing oxy-gen and removing carbon dioxide waste products so thelungs can rest. Infants who need ECMO may includethose with:
• meconium aspiration syndrome (breathing in of a new-
born’s first stool by a fetus or newborn, which canblock air passages and interfere with lung expansion)
• persistent pulmonary hypertension (a disorder in
which the blood pressure in the arteries supplying thelungs is abnormally high)
• respiratory distress syndrome (a lung disorder usually
of premature infants that causes increasing difficulty inbreathing, leading to a life-threatening deficiency ofoxygen in the blood)• congenital diaphragmatic hernia (the profusion of part
of the stomach through an opening in the diaphragm).
• pneumonia• blood poisoning
ECMO is also used to support a child or adult"
"• pneumonia• blood poisoning
ECMO is also used to support a child or adult
patient’s damaged, infected, or failing lungs for a fewhours to allow treatment or healing. It is effective forthose patients with severe, but reversible, heart or lungproblems who haven’t responded to treatment with aventilator, drugs, or extra oxygen. Adults and childrenwho need ECMO usually have one of these problems:
• heart failure• pneumonia•respiratory failure caused by trauma or severe infec-
tion
The ECMO procedure can help a patient’s lungs and
heart rest and recover, but it will not cure the underlyingdisease. Any patient who requires ECMO is seriously illand will likely die without the treatment. Because thereis some risk involved, this method is used only whenother means of support have failed.
Precautions
Typically, ECMO patients have daily chest x rays"
"Precautions
Typically, ECMO patients have daily chest x rays
and blood work, and constant vital sign monitoring. Theyare usually placed on a special rotating bed that isdesigned to decrease pressure on the skin and help movesecretions from the lungs.
After the patient is stable on ECMO, the breathing
machine settings will be lowered to “rest” settings, whichallows the lungs to rest without the risk of too much oxy-gen or pressure from the ventilator.
Description
There are two types of ECMO: Venoarterial (V-A)
ECMO supports the heart and lungs, and is used forpatients with blood pressure or heart functioning prob-lems in addition to respiratory problems. Venovenous (V-V) ECMO supports the lungs only.
V-A ECMO requires the insertion of two tubes, one
in the jugular and one in the carotid artery. In the V-VECMO procedure, the surgeon places a plastic tube intothe jugular vein through a small incision in the neck.
Once in place, the tubes are connected to the ECMO"
"Once in place, the tubes are connected to the ECMO
circuit, and then the machine is turned on. The patient’sblood flows out through the tube and may look very darkbecause it contains very little oxygen. A pump pushes theblood through an artificial membrane lung, where oxygenis added and carbon dioxide is removed. The size of the

"artificial lung depends on the size of the patient; sometimes
adults need two lungs. The blood is then warmed andreturned to the patient. A steady amount of blood (calledthe flow rate) is pushed through the ECMO machine everyminute. As the patient improves, the flow rate is lowered.
Many patients require heavy sedation while they are
on ECMO to lessen the amount of oxygen needed by themuscles.
As the patient improves, the amount of ECMO sup-
port will be decreased gradually, until the machine isturned off for a brief trial period. If the patient does wellwithout ECMO, the treatment is stopped.
Typically, newborns remain on ECMO for three to"
"Typically, newborns remain on ECMO for three to
seven days, although some babies need more time (espe-cially if they have a diaphragmatic hernia). Once thebaby is off ECMO, he or she will still need a ventilator(breathing machine) for a few days or weeks. Adults mayremain on ECMO for days to weeks, depending on thecondition of the patient, but treatment may be continuedfor a longer time depending on the type of heart or lungdisease, the amount of damage to the lungs beforeECMO was begun, and the presence of any other illness-es or health problems.
Preparation
Before ECMO is begun, the patient receives medica-
tion to ease pain and restrict movement.
Aftercare
Because infants on ECMO may have been strug-
gling with low oxygen levels before treatment, they maybe at higher risk for developmental problems. They willneed to be monitored as they grow.
Risks
Bleeding is the biggest risk for ECMO patients,"
"Risks
Bleeding is the biggest risk for ECMO patients,
since blood thinners are given to guard against bloodclots. Bleeding can occur anywhere in the body, but ismost serious when it occurs in the brain. This is whydoctors periodically perform ultrasound brain scans ofanyone on ECMO. Stroke , which may be caused by
bleeding or blood clots in the brain, has occurred in somepatients undergoing ECMO.
If bleeding becomes a problem, the patient may
require frequent blood transfusions or operations to con-trol the bleeding. If the bleeding can’t be stopped,ECMO will be withdrawn.
Other risks include infection or vocal cord injury.
Some patients develop severe blood infections that causeirreversible damage to vital organs.KEY TERMS

Eye and orbit ultrasounds
Definition
Ultrasound imaging equipment allows eye special-
ists (ophthalmologists) to “see” the eye in great detailwithout the pain and risk of exploratory surgery, or the
limitations and uncertainty inherent to traditional visu-al examination. Ultrasound is used to detect and diag-nose many eye diseases and injuries, to measure theeye prior to corrective surgery, and directly as a treat-ment tool.
Purpose
An ophthalmologist uses ultrasonic imaging to help
diagnose the underlying cause(s) of a patient’s symp-toms, to assess the general condition of an injured eye,and to measure the eye prior to corrective surgery. Situa-tions that may call for ultrasonic imaging include:
• Excessive tearing or visible infection. These external"
"• Excessive tearing or visible infection. These external
symptoms could indicate a serious underlying problemsuch as a tumor, an internal infection, the presence of adeeply lodged irritant (foreign body), or the effects of apreviously unrecognized injury. When presented withgeneral symptoms, ultrasound can speed diagnosis if aserious condition is suspected.
• Impaired vision. Fuzzy vision, poor night vision,
restricted (tunnel) vision, blind spots, extreme lightsensitivity, and even blindness can all stem from innereye conditions ranging from glaucoma and cataracts ,
to retinitis, detached retina, tumors, or impaired bloodcirculation. Again, high resolution ultrasound canquickly identify causes and pinpoint their location. Aspecial type of ultrasound, known as Doppler, can evenperceive and measure circulation in the tiny blood ves-sels of the eye.

"• Eye trauma. The eye can be damaged by a direct impact
or a puncture wound, as a result of a general head trau-ma, or by intense light exposure. Even when the causeof injury is obvious, ultrasound can reveal the exacttype, extent, and location of damage, from deforma-tions and ruptures to internal bleeding, and help toguide emergency care efforts.
• Lens replacement surgery. Exact measurement of the
eye’s optical dimensions with ultrasound greatlyimproves the visual outcome for cataract patientsreceiving permanent synthetic lenses; and for severelymyopic patients receiving implanted corrective lenses.
Ophthalmic ultrasound imaging is also used routine-
ly to guide the precise placement of instruments duringsurgery, and can be used directly for the treatment ofglaucoma and tumors of the eye.

"Precautions
Ultrasound of the eye, properly performed by quali-
fied personnel using appropriate equipment, has no risks.There is no evidence to suggest that the procedure itselfposes any threat to a healthy eye, or worsens the condi-tion of a diseased or injured eye.
Description
Ophthalmic ultrasound equipment sends high fre-
quency pulses of sound into the eye, where they bounceoff the boundaries between different structures in the eyeand produce a distinctive pattern of echoes. This echopattern is received and interpreted by a computer to pro-duce an image on a television screen. The time it takes anecho to return to the receiver corresponds to the depth ittraveled into the eye.

ultrasound is used to measure distances within the eye.This is A-mode ultrasound. A linear array of transduc-

of a cross section through the eye. Doppler modeultrasound combines B-mode with the ability to detectand measure the flow of blood in the tiny vessels ofthe eye.
As a direct treatment tool, the vibrations of high
intensity A-mode ultrasound can be used to heat anderode tumors. The same technique can be used to con-trol glaucoma by selectively destroying the cells whichproduce the fluid that causes the internal pressure of theeye to rise.

"examination is relatively simple. The patient relaxes in
a comfortable chair in a darkened room. Mild anestheticeye drops are administered and the head is held secure.The ultrasonic probe, coated with a sterile gel to ensuregood contact, is lightly pressed against the eye as theimages are made. The probe may be applied to the eye-lid or directly to the eye, as necessary. The patient feelsnothing else, and the whole office procedure takes about15 minutes.
Preparation
Preparation by the patient is generally unnecessary,
although under special circumstances an ophthalmologistmay perform pretest procedures. The ophthalmologistand/or ultrasound technician will conduct all prepara-tions at the time of the test.
Aftercare
Patients may experience partial and temporary
blurred vision, as well as “eye strain” headaches. Thesesymptoms usually fade within an hour of the procedure,during which time patients should rest their eyes andavoid all activities that require good eyesight, like driving."
"Risks
Improperly focused, high-intensity ultrasound could
burn and physically disrupt delicate eye tissue and causeinjury. This risk is, however, slight and would arise onlyfrom improper use, or as a potential side effect of tumoror glaucoma treatment.
Normal results
A normal ultrasound scan would indicate a fully
healthy eye. For therapeutic ultrasound, a normal resultwould be an improvement in the targeted condition, suchas shrinking of a tumor or lessening of pressure insidethe eye of a glaucoma patient.KEY TERMS
Cataracts —A clouding of the lens of the eye or the
material immediately surrounding it, causingblurred vision. For many people it occurs naturallywith aging, but may also result from injury.

"Glaucoma —A common eye disease characterized
by increased fluid pressure in the eye that dam-ages the optic nerve, which carries sensations tothe brain. Glaucoma can be caused by anothereye disorder, such as a tumor or congenital mal-formation, or appear without obvious cause, but ifuntreated it generally leads to blindness.
Intraocular —Literally, within the eye.
Ophthalmologist —A medical doctor specializing

Abnormal results
Because diagnostic ultrasound is generally used to
investigate symptoms, the results of a scan will often beabnormal and they will detect evidence of an underlyingcondition.

Eye cancer
Definition
A cancerous growth in any part of the eye.
Description
Eye cancer can occur in many parts of the eye
where a tumor can occur. Because of this there are sever-al types of ocular cancer. Their occurrence varies in theage of the affected individual. This article will focus onretinoblastoma , the most common eye cancer in chil-
dren, and intraocular melanoma, the most common eyecancer in adults.
Retinoblastoma can occur at any age but is most"
"Retinoblastoma can occur at any age but is most
often seen in children younger than five. About 200 chil-dren a year are diagnosed with it in the United States.Retinoblastoma starts with a small tumor in the retina,the very back of the eye. In growing children, the retinaoriginates from cells called retinoblasts that grow anddivide very quickly. These cells eventually become themature cells of the retina when they stop growing. In thecase of retinoblastoma the retinoblasts don’t stop grow-ing and form a tumor that can continue to grow and causefurther complications if not treated quickly.
Retinoblastoma typically has three classifications:"
"Retinoblastoma typically has three classifications:
intraocular, extraocular and recurrent retinoblastoma. Inthe intraocular form the cancer can be found in one orboth eyes but not in tissue external of the eye. In theextraocular form the cancer has spread outside the eye. Itcan spread to the tissue surrounding the eye or it caninvade other areas of the body. In the recurrent form thecancer returns after already being treated. It may recur inthe eye, its surrounding tissues, or elsewhere in the body.
Intraocular melanoma is a rare cancer overall, yet it
is the most common eye cancer seen in adults. It is whencancer cells are found in the uvea of the eye. The uveaincludes the iris (the colored portion of eye), the ciliarybody (an eye muscle that focuses the lens) and thechoroid (found in the back of the eye next to the retina).Intraocular cancer of the iris usually grows slowly"
"and usually doesn’t spread. The tumor is seen on the irisas a darker spot than the surrounding area. Intraocularcancer of the choroid or ciliary body occurs in the backof the eye. They are classified by size with a small tumorbeing 2-3 mm or smaller and a medium or large tumorbeing bigger than 3 mm.
Intraocular cancer can spread and become extraocu-
lar as well. If not found and treated early enough it canspread to the surrounding tissues, the optic nerve or intothe eye socket.
Causes and symptoms
Genetics is thought to play a role in eye cancer. In
regards to retinoblastoma, it is believed that if a tumordevelops only in one eye then it isn’t hereditary. Howev-er, if a tumor occurs in both eyes then it is hereditary.Those who have hereditary retinoblastoma have a rarerisk of developing a tumor in the brain and should bemonitored on a regular basis.
The cause of intraocular melanoma is still vague."
"The cause of intraocular melanoma is still vague.
Genetics could play a role, but age is also a factor. Inter-estingly enough, this type of cancer is seen most often inwhite people from a northern European descent.
The symptoms of this type of cancer usually begin
with blurred vision and tenderness of the eye. Advancedsymptoms may include loss of vision. If these symptomspersist a person should make an appointment with theirophthalmologist.
Diagnosis
An ophthalmologist makes a diagnosis. The doctor
is usually able to see the tumor through the pupil ordirectly on the iris if the cancer is intraocular melanomaof the iris. Because the doctor can usually readily see thetumor a biopsy is rarely needed.
An ultrasound or a fluorescein angiography are two"
"An ultrasound or a fluorescein angiography are two
tests doctors use to further diagnose eye cancers. In anultrasound sound waves are pointed at the tumor anddepending on how they reflect off the tumor the doctorcan better diagnose it. In a fluorescein angiography a flu-orescent dye is injected into the patients arm. When thisdye circulates through the body and reaches the eye aseries of rapid pictures are taken through the pupil. Thetumor will show up in these photos.
Once a diagnosis has been made, the treatment can
begin.
Treatment
The treatment depends on how far advanced the
tumor is. If the tumor is in the advanced stages and thereis little hope of regaining vision the most effective treat-

"ment is an enucleation, the removal of the eye. This obvi-
ously is a drastic treatment and is avoided if possible.Other eye surgeries include the following:
• choroidectomy-removal of part of the choroid,• iridectomy-removal of part of the iris,• iridocyclectomy-removal of parts of the ciliary body
and parts of iris,
• iridotrabeculectomy-removal of parts of the supporting
tissues around the cornea and iris.
In eye cancer where the tumor is small and there is a
good chance that the vision will be restored less drasticmeasures than the above surgeries are taken. Radiationand chemotherapy are two courses of treatment that
help in killing off the existing tumor and preventing itsspread into other areas of the body.

"Besides radiation and chemotherapy there are other
methods of treating eye cancer. Cryotherapy uses
extreme cold to destroy the cancer cells. Thermotherapyuses heat to destroy the cancer cells. Photocoagulationuses a laser to destroy blood vessels that supply the tumorwith nutrients. If the tumor isn’t advanced these are goodoptions to treat it in order to avoid losing an eye.
A radiation/surgical treatment for eye cancer is
brachytherapy. A small plaque with radioactive iodine onone side and gold on the other is stitched to the eyebehind the tumor with the radioactive iodine facing thetumor. The gold is used to shield the other tissues fromthe radiation. It is left there for a period of time depend-ing on the dosage of radiation needed and then it isremoved. In this way the tumor is treated and hopefullywill shrink and eventually die.
Alternative Treatment

"Alternative Treatment
Other than the treatments above, there aren’t any
alternative treatments. New clinical trials are constantlyunder way to further the treatment of the disease in thefuture.
Prognosis
All forms of retinoblastoma and intraocular mela-
noma are treatable. Enucleation can usually be avoided iffound early enough. The outlook is positive for peoplewith eye cancer.
Prevention
A good healthy diet and lifestyle are always recom-
mended to prevent cancer. Known carcinogens shouldalways be avoided.KEY TERMS

Eye examination
Definition
An eye examination is a series of tests that measure
a person’s ocular health and visual status, to detectabnormalities in the components of the visual system,and to determine how well the person can see.
Purpose
An eye examination is performed by an ophthalmol-
ogist M.D. or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy ), or an optom-
etrist (O.D.) to determine if there are any pre-existing orpotential vision problems. Eye exams may also reveal thepresence of many non-eye diseases. Many systemic dis-eases can affect the eyes, and since the blood vessels onthe retina are observed during the exam, certain problemsmay be uncovered (e.g., high blood pressure or diabetes)."
"Infants should be examined by a physician to detect
any physical abnormalities. Frequency of eye exams thengenerally differs with age and the health of the person. Eyeexams can be performed in infants, and if a problem is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1261Eye examinationGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1261"
"noted the infant can be seen, generally by a pediatric oph-
thalmologist. A child with no symptoms should have aneye exam at age three. Early exams are important becausepermanent decreases in vision (e.g., amblyopia , also
called lazy eye) can occur if not treated early (usually byages 6–9). Again, with no other symptoms, the se cond
exam should take place before first grade. After firstgrade, the American Optometric Association recom-mends an eye exam every two years; ages 19–40, everytwo to three years; ages 41–60, every two years; andannually after that. However, these are recommendationsfor healthy people with no risk factors. Patients shouldask their doctors how often they should come for exams.Some patients have risk factors for eye disease (e.g., peo-ple with diabetes or a family history of eye disease;African Americans, who are at higher risk for glaucoma )"
"and may need more frequent checkups. Also, if childrenseem to be having trouble in school, problems with read-ing, rubbing their eyes when reading, etc., an eye exammay be necessary sooner.
Precautions
The examiner needs to know if the patient is taking
any medications or has any existing health conditions.Some medications, even over-the-counter (OTC) medica-tions can affect vision or even interfere with the eyedropsthe doctor may use during the exam. Certain eyedropswould not be used if the patient has asthma , heart prob-
lems, or other conditions.
The patient may need someone to drive them home
in case the eyes were dilated. Bringing sunglasses to theexam may also help decrease the glare from light untilthe dilating drops wear off.

"Description
An eye examination, given by an ophthalmologist or
optometrist, costs about $100. It may or may not be cov-ered by insurance. It begins with information from thepatient (case history) and continues with a set of primarytests, plus additional specialized tests given as needed, dic-tated by the outcomes of initial testing and the patient’sage. The primary tests can be divided into two groups,those that evaluate the physical state of the eyes and sur-rounding areas, and those that measure the ability to see.
The order of the tests for the exam may differ from
doctor to doctor, however, most exams will include thefollowing procedures:
Information gathering and initial observations
The examiner will take eye and medical histories that
include the patient’s chief complaint, any past eye disor-ders, all medications being taken (e.g., OTC medications,
antibiotics , and birth control pills), any blood relatives"
"antibiotics , and birth control pills), any blood relatives
with eye disorders, and any systemic disorders the patientmay have. The patient should also tell the doctor abouthobbies and work conditions. This information helps inmodifying prescriptions and lets the doctor know how thepatient uses his or her eyes. For example, using a comput-er screen vs. construction work, the working distance of acomputer screen may affect the prescription; the con-struction worker needs protective eyewear.
The patient should bring their current pair of glasses
to the exam. The doctor can get the prescription from theglasses by using an instrument called a lensometer.
Visual acuity examination
Visual acuity measures how clearly the patient can"
"see. It is measured for each eye separately, with andwithout the current prescription. It is usually measuredwith a Snellen eye chart, a poster with lines of different-sized letters, each line with a number at the side denotingthe distance from which a person with normal vision canread that line. Other kinds of eye charts with identifiablefigures are available for children or anyone unfamiliarwith the Roman alphabet. These charts are made to beplaced at a certain distance (usually 20 ft) from the per-son being tested. At this distance, people with normalvision can read a certain line (usually the lowest),marked the 20/20 line; these people are said to have20/20 vision. For people who can’t read the smallest line,the examiner assigns a ratio based on the smallest linethey can read. The first number (numerator) of the ratiois the distance between the chart and the patient, and thesecond number (denominator) is the distance where aperson with normal vision would be able to read thatline."
(denominator) is the distance where aperson with normal vision would be able to read thatline. The ratio 20/40 means the patient can see at 20 ft.what people with normal vision can see at 40 ft. away.
"When a patient is unable to read any lines on the
chart, they are moved closer until they can read the linewith the largest letters. The acuity is still measured thesame way. A ratio of 5/200 means the person being testedcan see at 5 ft what a normal person can see 200 ft.
When a patient can’t read the chart at all, the exam-
iner may hold up some fingers and ask the patient tocount them at various distances, and records the result as“counting fingers” at the distance of recognition. If thepatient cannot count the examiner’s fingers at any dis-tance, the examiner determines if the patient can seehand movements. If so, the result is recorded as “handmovements.” If not, the examiner determines if thepatient can detect light from a penlight. If the patient candetect the light but not its direction, the result is recordedat “light perception.” If the patient can recognize its

"direction, the result is recorded as “light projection.” If
the patient cannot detect the light at all, the result isrecorded as “no light perception.”
Eye movement examination and cover tests
The examiner asks the patient to look up and down,
and to the right and left to see if the patient can move theeyes to their full extent. The examiner asks the patient tostare at an object, then quickly covers one eye and notesany movement in the eye that remains uncovered. Thisprocedure is repeated with the other eye. This, and anoth-er similar cover test, helps to determine if there is anundetected eye turn or problem with fixation. The doctormay also have the patient look at a pen and follow it as itis moved close to the eyes. This checks convergence.
Iris and pupil examination
The doctor checks the pupil’s response to light (if it
dilates and constricts appropriately). The iris is viewedfor symmetry and physical appearance. The iris ischecked more thoroughly later using a slit lamp."
"Refractive error determination-Refraction
The examiner will determine the refractive error and
obtain a prescription for corrective lenses for peoplewhose visual acuity is less than 20/20. An instrumentcalled a phoropter, which the patient sits behind, is gen-erally used (sometimes the refraction can be done with atrial frame that the patient wears). The phoropter isequipped with many lenses that allow the examiner totest many combinations of corrections to learn whichcorrection allows the patient to see the eye chart mostclearly. This is the part of the exam when the doctor usu-ally says, “Which is better, one or two?” The phoropteralso contains prisms, and sometimes the doctor willintentionally make the patient see double. This may helpin determining a slight eye turn. The exam will checkvision at distance and near (reading).
A prescription for corrective lenses can also be sup-"
"A prescription for corrective lenses can also be sup-
plied by automated refracting devices, which measurethe necessary refraction by shining a light into the eyeand observing the reflected light. Another objective wayto obtain a prescription is using a hand-held retinoscope.As in the automated method just mentioned, the doctorshines a light in the patient’s eyes and can determine anobjective prescription. This is helpful in young childrenor infants.
Sometimes drops will be instilled in the patient’s eyes
before this part of the exam. The drops may relax accom-modation so that the refraction will be more accurate. Thisis helpful in children and people who are farsighted.After the refraction and other visual status tests, for
example color tests or binocularity tests (can the patient see3-D, or have depth perception), the doctor will check thehealth of the eyes and surrounding areas. The main instru-ments used are the ophthalmoscope and the slit lamp.
Ophthalmoscopic examination"
"Ophthalmoscopic examination
These observations are best accomplished after
dilating the pupils and require an ophthalmoscope. Theophthalmoscope most frequently used is a called a direct
ophthalmoscope . It is a hand-held illuminated 15X
multi-lens magnifier that lets the examiner view theinside back area of the eye (fundus). The retina, bloodvessels, optic nerve, and other structures are examined.
Slit lamp examination
The slit lamp is a microscope with a light source that
can be adjusted. This magnifies the external and someinternal structures of the eyes. The lid and lid margin,cornea, iris, pupil, conjunctiva, sclera, and lens are exam-ined. The slit lamp is also used in contact lens evalua-tions. A little probe called a tonometer may be used atthis time to check the pressure of the eyes. A colored eye-drop may be instilled immediately prior to this test. Thedrop has a local anesthetic so the patient won’t feel theprobe touch the eye. It is a quick procedure."
"Visual field measurement
A perimeter, the instrument for measuring visual
fields, is a hollow hemisphere, equipped with a lightsource that projects dots of light over the inside surface.The patient’s head is positioned so that the eye beingtested is at the center of the sphere and 13 in (about 33

"cm) from all points on the inside surface of the hemi-
sphere. The patient stares straight ahead at an image onthe center of the surface and signals whenever he or shedetects a flash of light. The perimeter records whichflashes are seen and which are missed and maps thepatient’s field of vision and blindspots.
Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement
Tonometers are used to measure IOP. Some tonome-
ters measure pressure by expelling a puff of air (noncon-tact tonometer) towards the eyeball from a very short dis-tance. Other tonometers are placed directly on the cornea.The noncontact tonometers are not as accurate as the con-tact tonometers and are sometimes used for screenings.

Eye glasses and contact lenses
Definition
Eyeglasses and contact lenses are devices that cor-
rect refractive errors in vision. Eyeglass lenses aremounted in frames worn on the face, sitting mostly onthe ears and nose, so that the lenses are positioned infront of the eyes. Contact lenses appear to be worn indirect contact with the cornea, but they actually float on alayer of tears that separates them from the cornea.
Purpose
The purpose of eyeglasses and contact lenses is to
correct or improve the vision of people with nearsighted-ness ( myopia ), farsightedness ( hyperopia ),presbyopia ,
and astigmatism .
Precautions

"and astigmatism .
Precautions
People allergic to certain plastics should not wear
contact lenses or eyeglass frames or lenses manufacturedfrom that type of plastic. People allergic to nickel shouldnot wear Flexon frames. People at risk of being in acci-dents that might shatter glass lenses should wear plasticlenses, preferably polycarbonate. (Lenses made frompolycarbonate, the same type of plastic used for thespace shuttle windshield, are about 50 times strongerthan other lens materials.) Also, people at risk of receiv-ing electric shock should avoid metal frames.
People employed in certain occupations may be pro-
hibited from wearing contact lenses, or may be requiredto wear safety eyewear over the contact lenses. Someoccupations, such as construction or auto repair, mayrequire safety lenses and safety frames. Physicians andemployers should be consulted for recommendations.

"glasses. The glasses are generally made by an optician. A
separate contact lens-fitting exam is necessary if thepatient wants contact lenses, because an eyeglass pre-scription is not the same as a contact lens prescription.
Eyeglasses
Over 140 million people in the United States wear
eyeglasses. People whose eyes have refractive errors do notsee clearly without glasses, because the light emitted fromthe objects they are observing does not come into focus ontheir retinas. For people who are farsighted, images comeinto focus behind the retina; for people who are nearsight-ed, images come into focus in front of the retina.
LENSES. Lenses work by changing the direction of
light so that images come into focus on the retina. Thegreater the index of refraction of the lens material and thegreater the difference in the curvature between the twosurfaces of the lens, the greater the change in direction oflight that passes through it, and the greater the correction."
"Lenses can be unifocal, with one correction for all
distances, or they can be correct for more than one dis-tance (multifocal). One type of multifocal, the bifocal,has an area of the lens (usually at the bottom) that cor-rects for nearby objects (about 14 in from the eyes); theremainder of the lens corrects for distant objects (about20 ft from the eyes). Another type of multifocal, a trifo-cal, has an area in-between that corrects for intermedi-ate distances (usually about 28 in). Conventional bifo-cals and trifocals have visible lines between the areas ofdifferent correction; however, lenses where the correc-tion gradually changes from one area to the other, with-out visible lines, have been available since the 1970s.Such lenses are sometimes called progressives or no-line bifocals.

"To be suitable for eyeglass lenses, a material must be
transparent, without bubbles, and have a high index ofrefraction. The greater the index of refraction, the thinnerthe lens can be. Lenses are made from either glass orplastic (hard resin). The advantage of plastic is that it islightweight and more impact resistant than glass. Theadvantage of glass is that it is scratch resistant and pro-vides the clearest possible vision.
Glass was the first material to be used for eyeglass
lenses, and was used for several hundred years beforeplastic was introduced. The crown glass used for eye-glass lenses has an index of refraction of 1.52.
Optical-quality acrylic was introduced for eyeglass
use in the early 1940s, but because it was easilyscratched, brittle, and discolored rapidly, it did not sup-plant glass as the material of choice. Furthermore, it hada relatively low index of refraction, so it wasn’t suitablefor people with large refractive errors. A plastic called"
"CR-39, introduced in the 1960s, was more suitable.Today, eyeglass wearers can also choose between poly-carbonate, which is the most impact-resistant materialavailable for eyewear, and polyurethane, which hasexceptional optical qualities and an index of refraction ofup to 1.66, much higher than the conventional plasticsused for lenses, and even higher than glass. Patients withhigh prescriptions should ask about high index materialoptions for their lenses. Aspheric lenses are also usefulfor high prescriptions. They are flatter and lighter thanconventional lenses.

"There are many lenses and lens-coating options for
individual needs, including coatings that block the ultra-violet (UV) light or UV and blue light which have beenfound to be harmful to the eyes. Such coatings are notneeded on polycarbonate lenses, which already have UVprotection. UV coatings are particularly important onsunglasses and ski goggles. Sunglasses, when nonpre-scription, should be labeled with an indication that theyblock out 99–100% of both UV-A and UV-B rays.

"There are anti-scratch coatings that increase the
surface hardness of lenses (an important feature whenusing plastic lenses) and anti-reflective (AR) coatingsthat eliminate almost all glare and allow other people tosee the eyes of the wearer. AR coatings may be particu-larly helpful to people who use computers or who driveat night. Mirror coatings that prevent other people fromseeing the wearer’s eyes are also available. There is awhole spectrum of tints, from light tints to darker tints,used in sunglasses. Tint, however, does not block-outUV rays, so a UV coating is needed. Polaroid lensesthat block out much of the reflected light also allow bet-ter vision in sunny weather and are helpful for peoplewho enjoy boating. Photosensitive (photochromatic)lenses that darken in the presence of bright light arehandy for people who don’t want to carry an extra set ofglasses. Photochromatic lenses are available in glassand plastic.

"FRAMES. Frames can be made from metal or plastic,
and they can be rimless. There is an almost unlimitedvariety of shapes, colors, and sizes. The type and degreeof refractive correction in the lens determine to someextent the type of frame most suitable. Some lenses aretoo thick to fit in metal rims, and some large-correctionprescriptions are best suited to frames with small-arealenses.
Rimless frames are the least noticeable type, and they
are lightweight because the nosepiece and temples areattached directly to the lenses, eliminating the weight ofthe rims. They tend to not be as sturdy as frames with rims,so they are not a good choice for people who frequently

"remove their glasses and put them on again. They are also
not very suitable for lenses that correct a high degree offarsightedness, because such lenses are thin at the edges.
Metal frames are less noticeable than plastic, and
they are lightweight. They are available in solid gold,gold-filled, anodized aluminum, nickel, silver, stainlesssteel, and now titanium and titanium alloy. Until the late1980s, when titanium-nickel alloy and titanium frameswere introduced, metal frames were, in general, morefragile than plastic frames. The titanium frames, howev-er, are very strong and lightweight. An alloy of titaniumand nickel, called Flexon, is not only strong and light-weight, but returns to its original shape after being twist-ed or dented. It is not perfect for everyone, though,because some people are sensitive to its nickel. Flexonframes are also relatively expensive.

"Plastic frames are durable, can accommodate just
about any lens prescription, and are available in a widerange of prices. They are also offered in a variety of plas-tics (including acrylic, epoxy, cellulose acetate, cellulosepropionate, polyamide, and nylon) and in different colors,shapes, and levels of resistance to breakage. Epoxyframes are resilient and return to their original shape afterbeing deformed, so they do not need to be adjusted as fre-quently as other types. Nylon frames are almost unbreak-able. They revert to their original shape after extremetrauma and distortion; because of this property, though,they cannot be readjusted after they are manufactured.

"FIT. The patient should have the distance between
the eyes (PD) measured, so that the optical centers of thelenses will be in front of the patient’s pupils. Bifocalheights also have to be measured with the chosen framein place and adjusted on the patient. Again, this is so thelenses will be positioned correctly. If not positioned cor-rectly, the patient may experience eyestrain or otherproblems. This can occur with over-the-counter readingglasses. The distance between the lenses is for a “stan-dard” person. Generally, this will not be a problem, but ifa patient is sensitive or has more closely set eyes, forexample, it may pose a problem. Persons buying ready-made sunglasses or reading glasses should hold them upto see if they appear clear. They should also hold thelenses to see an object with straight lines reflected off ofthe lenses. If the lines don’t appear straight, the lensesmay be warped or inferior.

"Patients may sometimes need a few days to adjust to
a new prescription; however, problems should be report-ed, because the glasses may need to be rechecked.
Contact lenses
Over 32 million people in the United States wear
these small lenses that fit on top of the cornea. They pro-vide a field of view unobstructed by eyeglass frames;
they do not fog-up or get splattered, so it is possible tosee well while walking in the rain; and they are lessnoticeable than any eyeglass style. On the other hand,they take time to get accustomed to; require more mea-surements for fitting; require many follow-up visits tothe eye doctor; can lead to complications such as infec-tions and corneal damage; and may not correct astigma-tism as well as eyeglasses, especially if the astigmatismis severe.
Originally, hard contact lenses were made of a mate-
rial called PMMA. Although still available, the morecommon types of contact lenses are listed below:
• Rigid gas-permeable (RGP) daily-wear lenses are made"
"• Rigid gas-permeable (RGP) daily-wear lenses are made
of plastic that does not absorb water but allows oxygento get from the atmosphere to the cornea. (This isimportant because the cornea has no blood supply andneeds to get its oxygen from the atmosphere throughthe film of tears that moves beneath the lens.) Theymust be removed and cleaned each night.
• Rigid gas-permeable (RGP) extended-wear lenses are
made from plastic that also does not absorb water but ismore permeable to oxygen than the plastic used fordaily-wear lenses. They can be worn up to a week.
• Daily wear soft lenses are made of plastic that is per-
meable to oxygen and absorbs water; therefore, theyare soft and flexible. These lenses must be removedand cleaned each night, and they do not correct allvision problems. Soft lenses are easier to get used tothan rigid lenses, but are more prone to tears and donot last as long.

"• Extended-wear soft lenses are highly permeable to oxy-
gen, are flexible by virtue of their ability to absorbwater, and can usually be worn for up to one week.They do not correct all vision problems. There is moreof a risk of infection with extended-wear lenses thanwith daily-wear lenses.
• Extended-wear disposable lenses are soft lenses worn
continually for up to six days and then discarded, withno need for cleaning.
• Planned-replacement soft lenses are daily wear lenses
that are replaced on a regular schedule, which is usuallyevery two weeks, monthly, or quarterly. They must alsobe cleaned.
Soft contact lenses come in a variety of materials.
There are also different kinds of RGP and soft multifocalcontact lenses available. Monovision, where one contactlens corrects for distance vision while the other correctsfor near vision, may be an option for presbyopic patients.Monovision, however, may affect depth perception andmay not be appropriate for everyone. Contact lenses also"

"come in a variety of tints. Soft contacts are available that
can change dark-colored eyes a different color. Eventhough such lenses have no prescription, they must stillbe fitted and checked to make sure that an eye infectiondoes not occur. People should NEVER wear someoneelse’s contact lenses. This can lead to infection or dam-age to the eye.
Aftercare
Contact lens wearers must be examined periodical-
ly by their eye doctors to make sure that the lenses fitproperly and that there is no infection. Both infectionand lenses that do not fit properly can damage thecornea. Patients can be allergic to certain solutions thatare used to clean or lubricate the lenses. For that reason,patients should not randomly switch products unlessthey speak with their doctor.

"ity to light, cloudy vision, or an inability to keep theeyes open.
To avoid infection, it is important for contact lens
wearers to exactly follow their instructions for lens inser-tion and removal, as well as cleaning. Soft contact lenswearers should never use tap water to rinse their lenses orto make-up solutions. All contact lens wearers shouldalso always have a pair of glasses and a carrying case fortheir contacts with them, in case the contacts have to beremoved due to eye irritation.KEY TERMS

"Eye muscle surgery
Definition
Eye muscle surgery is surgery to weaken, strength-
en, or reposition any of the muscles that move the eyeball(the extraocular muscles).
Purpose
The purpose of eye muscle surgery is generally to
align the pair of eyes so that they gaze in the same direc-tion and move together as a team, either to improveappearance or to aid in the development of binocularvision in a young child. To achieve binocular vision, thegoal is to align the eyes so that the location of the imageon the retina of one eye corresponds to the location of theimage on the retina of the other eye.
In addition, sometimes eye muscle surgery can help
people with other eye disorders ( nystagmus and Duane
syndrome, for example).
Precautions
Depth perception (stereopsis) develops around the"
"syndrome, for example).
Precautions
Depth perception (stereopsis) develops around the
age of three months old. For successful development ofbinocular vision and the ability to perceive three-dimen-sionally, the surgery should not be postponed past the ageof four. The earlier the surgery the better the outcome, soan early diagnosis is important. Surgery may even beperformed before two years old. After surgery, if binocu-lar vision is to develop, corrective lenses and eye exercis-es (vision therapy) will probably be necessary.
Description
The extraocular muscles attach via tendons to the
sclera (the white, opaque, outer protective covering ofthe eyeball) at different places just behind an imaginaryequator circling the top, bottom, left, and right of the eye.The other end of each of these muscles attaches to a partof the orbit (the eye socket in the skull). These musclesenable the eyes to move up, down, to one side or theother, or any angle in between."
"Normally both eyes move together, receive the same
image on corresponding locations on both retinas, and thebrain fuses these images into one three-dimensionalimage. The exception is in strabismus which is a disorder
where one or both eyes deviate out of alignment, mostoften outwardly (exotropia) or toward the nose(esotropia). The brain now receives two different images,and either suppresses one or the person sees double(diplopia). This deviation can be adjusted by weakeningor strengthening the appropriate muscles to move the eyestoward the center. For example, if an eye turns upward,the muscle at the bottom of the eye could be strengthened.
Rarely, eye muscle surgery is performed on people"
"Rarely, eye muscle surgery is performed on people
with nystagmus or Duane syndrome. Nystagmus is a con-dition where one or both eyes move rapidly or oscillate; itcan sometimes be helped by moving the eyes to the posi-tion of least oscillation. Duane syndrome is a disorderwhere there is limited horizontal eye movement; it cansometimes be relieved by surgery to weaken an eye muscle.
There are two methods to alter extraocular muscles."
"There are two methods to alter extraocular muscles.
Traditional surgery can be used to strengthen, weaken, orreposition an extraocular muscle. The surgeon firstmakes an incision in the conjunctiva (the clear membranecovering the sclera), then puts a suture into the muscle toprevent it from getting lost and loosens the muscle fromthe eyeball with a surgical hook. During a resection, themuscle is detached from the sclera, a piece of muscle isremoved so the muscle is now shorter, and the muscle isreattached to the same place. This strengths the muscle.In a recession, the muscle is made weaker by reposition-ing it. More than one extraocular eye muscle might beoperated on at the same time.
Another way of weakening eye muscles, using botu-"
"Another way of weakening eye muscles, using botu-
linum toxin injected into the muscle, was introduced inthe early 1980s. Although the botulinum toxin wears off,the realignment may be permanent, depending uponwhether neurological connections for binocular visionwere established during the time the toxin was active.This technique can also be used to adjust a muscle aftertraditional surgery.
The cost of eye muscle surgery is about $2,000–
$4,000, and about 700,000 surgeries are performed annu-ally in the United States.
Preparation
Patients should make sure their doctors are aware of
any medications that they are taking, even over-the-counter medications. Patients should not take aspirin ,o r
any other blood-thinning medications for ten days priorto surgery, and should not eat or drink after midnight thenight before.

"Aftercare
Patients will need someone to drive them home after
their surgery. They should continue to avoid aspirin andother non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for an addi-tional three days, but they can take acetaminophen (e.g.,
Tylenol). Patients should discuss this with the surgeon tobe clear what medications they can or cannot take. Pain
will subside after two to three days, and patients canresume most normal activities within a few days. Again,

"this may vary with the patient and the patient should dis-
cuss returning to normal activity with the surgeon. Theyshould not get their eyes wet for three to four days andshould refrain from swimming for 10 days. Operated eyeswill be red for about two weeks.
Risks
As with any surgery, there are risks involved. Eye
muscle surgery is relatively safe, but very rarely a cutmuscle gets lost and can not be retrieved. This, and otherserious reactions, including those caused by anesthetics,can result in vision loss in the affected eye. Occasionally,retinal or nerve damage occurs. Double vision is notuncommon after eye muscle surgery. As mentioned earli-er, glasses or vision therapy may be necessary.

Eyelid disorders
Definition
An eyelid disorder is any abnormal condition that
affects the eyelids.
Description
Eyelids consist of thin folds of skin, muscle, and
connective tissue. The eyelids protect the eyes and spreadtears over the front of the eyes. The inside of the eyelidsare lined with the conjunctiva of the eyelid (the palpebralconjunctiva), and the outside of the lids are covered withthe body’s thinnest skin. Some common lid problemsinclude the following: stye, blepharitis, chalazion, entro-pion, ectropion, eyelid edema , and eyelid tumors.
Stye
A stye is an infection of one of the three types of eye-
lid glands near the lid margins, at the base of the lashes.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1270Eyelid disordersGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1270"
"Chalazion
A chalazion is an enlargement of a meibomian gland
(an oil-producing gland in the eyelid), usually not associ-ated with an infectious agent. More likely, the glandopening is clogged. Initially, a chalazion may resemble astye, but it usually grows larger. A chalazion may also belocated in the middle of the lid and be internal.
Blepharitis
Blepharitis is the inflammation of the eyelid mar-
gins, often with scales and crust. It can lead to eyelashloss, chalazia, styes, ectropion, corneal damage, exces-sive tearing, and chronic conjunctivitis .
Entropion
Entropion is a condition where the eyelid margin
(usually the lower one) is turned inward; the eyelashestouch the eye and irritate the cornea.
Ectropion
Ectropion is a condition where one or both eyelid
margins turn outward, exposing both the conjunctiva thatcovers the eye and the conjunctiva that lines the eyelid.
Eyelid edema
Eyelid edema is a condition where the eyelids con-
tain excessive fluid.
Eyelid tumors"
"Eyelid edema
Eyelid edema is a condition where the eyelids con-
tain excessive fluid.
Eyelid tumors
Eyelids are susceptible to the same skin tumors as
the skin over the rest of the body, including noncancer-ous tumors and cancerous tumors (basal cell carcinoma,squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma , and
sebaceous gland carcinoma). Eyelid muscles are suscep-tible to sarcoma.
Causes and symptoms
Stye
Styes are usually caused by bacterial staphylococcal
infections . The symptoms are pain and inflammation in
one or more localized regions near the eyelid margin.
Chalazion
A chalazion is caused by a blockage in the outflow
duct of a meibomian gland. Symptoms are inflammationand swelling in the form of a round lump in the lid thatmay be painful.
Blepharitis
Some cases of blepharitis are caused by bacterial
infection and some by head lice, but in some cases, thecause is unclear. It may also be caused by an overproduc-"
"tion of oil by the meibomian glands. Blepharitis can be achronic condition that begins in early childhood and canlast throughout life. Symptoms can include itching , burn-
ing, a feeling that something is in the eye, inflammation,and scales or matted, hard crusts surrounding the eyelashes.
Entropion
Entropion usually results from aging , but sometimes
can be due to a congenital defect, a spastic eyelid muscle,or a scar on the inside of the lid that could be fromsurgery, injury, or disease. It is accompanied by exces-sive tearing, redness, and discomfort.
Ectropion
Similar to entropion, the usual cause of ectropion is
aging. It also can be due to a spastic eyelid muscle or ascar, as in entropion. It also can be the result of allergies .
Symptoms are excessive tearing and hardening of theeyelid conjunctiva.
Eyelid edema
Eyelid edema is most often caused by allergic reac-
tions, for example, allergies to eye makeup, eyedrops orother drugs, or plant allergens such as pollen. Trichinosis ,"
"a disease caused by eating undercooked meat, also causeseyelid edema. However, swelling can also be caused bymore serious causes, such as infection, and can lead toorbital cellulitis which can threaten vision. Symptoms can
include swelling, itching, redness, or pain.
Eyelid tumors
Tumors found on the eyelids are caused by the same
conditions that cause these tumors elsewhere on the

"body. They are usually painless and may or may not be
pigmented. Some possible causes include AIDS
(Kaposi’s sarcoma ) or increased exposure to ultraviolet
(UV) rays which may lead to skin cancer .
Diagnosis
An instrument called a slit lamp is generally used to
magnify the structures of the eyes. The doctor may presson the lid margin to see if oil can be expressed from themeibomian glands. The doctor may invert the lid to seethe inside of the lid. Biopsy is used to diagnose cancer-ous tumors.
Treatment
Stye
Styes are treated with warm-hot compresses for
10–15 minutes, three to four times a day. Sometimes top-ical antibiotics may be prescribed. If the initial treatment
is ineffective, styes are lanced and drained.
Chalazion

"Chalazion
About 25% of chalazia will disappear spontaneous-
ly, but hot compresses may speed the process. Becausechalazia are inside the lid, topical medications are gener-ally of no benefit. Medication may need to be injected bythe doctor into the chalazion or if that doesn’t help thechalazion may need to be excised. If what appears to be achalazion recurs on the same site as any previous one, thepossibility of sebaceous gland carcinoma should beinvestigated by biopsy.Blepharitis
Blepharitis is treated with hot compresses, with
antibiotic ointment, and by cleaning the eyelids with amoist washcloth and then with baby shampoo. Goodhygiene is essential. If the blepharitis doesn’t clear upwith treatment or if it seems to be a chronic problem, thepatient may have acnerosacea . These patients may need
to see a dermatologist as well.

"Entropion and ectropion
Both entropion and ectropion can be surgically cor-
rected. Prior to surgery, the lower lid of entropion can betaped down to keep the lashes off the eye, and both can betreated with lubricating drops to keep the cornea moist.
Eyelid edema
Patients with swollen eyelids should contact their
eye doctor. A severely swollen lid can press on the eyeand possibly increase the intraocular pressure. An infec-tion needs to be ruled out. Or, something as simple as anallergy to nail polish and then touching the eyes cancause swelling. The best treatment for allergic eyelidedema is to find and remove the substance causing theallergy. When that is not possible, as in the case of plantallergens, cold compresses and immunosuppresesivedrugs such as corticosteroid creams are helpful. Howev-er, steroids can cause cataracts and increase intraocular"
"pressure and patients must be very careful not to get thecream in their eyes. This should not be done unless undera doctor’s care. For edema caused by trichinosis, thetrichinosis must be treated.
Eyelid tumors
Cancerous tumors should be removed upon discov-
ery, and noncancerous tumors should be removed beforethey become big enough to interfere with vision or eyelidfunction. Eyelid tumors require special considerationbecause of their sensitive location. It is important thattreatment not compromise vision, eye movement, or eye-lid movement. Accordingly, eyelid reconstruction willsometimes accompany tumor excision.

"Prognosis
The prognosis for styes and chalazia is good to
excellent. With treatment, blepharitis, ectropion, andentropion usually have good outcomes. The prognosisfor nonmalignant tumors, basal cell carcinoma, and squa-mous cell carcinoma is good once they are properlyremoved. Survival rate for malignant melanoma dependsupon how early it was discovered and if it was complete-ly removed. Sebaceous carcinomas are difficult to detect,so poor outcomes are more frequent.

"All of these eyelid disorders, if not treated, can lead
to other, possibly serious vision problems—dry eye,astigmatism , or even vision loss, for example. An oph-
thalmologist or optometrist should be consulted.
Prevention
Good lid hygiene is very important. Regular eyelid
washing with baby shampoo helps prevent styes, cha-lazia, blepharitis, and eyelid edema. To avoid these prob-lems, it’s also important to refrain from touching andrubbing the eyes and eyelids, especially with hands thathave not just been washed.
Blepharitis is associated with dandruff, which is
caused by a kind of bacteria that is one of the causes ofblepharitis. Controlling dandruff by washing the hair,scalp, and eyebrows with shampoo containing seleniumsulfide to kill the bacteria helps control the blepharitis.When using anything near the eyes, it is important toread the label or consult with a doctor first.
Avoiding allergens helps prevent allergic eyelid"
"Avoiding allergens helps prevent allergic eyelid
edema. Staying inside as much as possible when pollencounts are high and eliminating the use of, or at leastremoving eye makeup thoroughly, or using hypo-aller-genic makeup may help if the person is sensitive to thosesubstances.
Sunscreen, UV-blocking sunglasses, and wide brim-
med hats can help prevent eyelid tumors.
Entropian and ectropian seem to be unpreventable.

Face lift
Definition
Face lift surgery is a cosmetic procedure that involves
redirecting some of the skin and muscle tissue of the faceand neck to counter signs of aging produced by gravity.
Purpose
The purpose of face lift surgery, also known as
facialplasty, rhytidoplasty, or cervicofacial rhytidectomy,is to improve the appearance of the face by repositioningthe skin and tightening some of the underlying muscleand tissue. The procedure is designed to counter saggingand looseness in skin and muscle tissue caused by gravi-ty as the patient ages. Face lift surgery will not erase allfacial wrinkles, as the term rhytidectomy (which literallymeans “surgical removal of wrinkles”) might imply.Wrinkles around the mouth and eyes, for example, maybenefit little from face lift surgery. Other procedures,such as blepharoplasty , chemical peel, or dermabrasion,
also may be necessary.
Precautions

"also may be necessary.
Precautions
Patients with other medical conditions should consult
with their primary physician before undergoing face liftsurgery. Lung problems, heart disease, and certain otherconditions can lead to a higher risk of complications.Patients who take medications that can alter the way theirblood clots (including female hormones, aspirin , and
some non-aspirin pain relievers) should stop these med-
ications prior to surgery to lower the risk that a hematomawill form. A hematoma, a pocket of blood below the skin,is the most frequent complication of face lift surgery.Description
Face lift surgery can be performed on an outpatient
basis with local anesthetics. Patients typically alsoreceive “twilight anesthesia,” an intravenous sedative thathelps to lower their awareness of the procedure beingperformed.
There are a number of variations of face lift surgery."
"There are a number of variations of face lift surgery.
Which one is used will depend on the patient’s facialstructure, how much correction is needed, and the prefer-ences of the surgeon performing the procedure. In a typi-cal face lift surgery, the surgeon begins by making an inci-sion within the hairline just above the ear. The incisioncontinues down along the front edge of the ear, around theearlobe, and then up and behind the ear extending backinto the hairline. The location of this incision is designedto hide any sign of the procedure later. The same proce-dure is repeated on the other side of the face. Using vari-ous instruments, the surgeon will then work to separate theskin of the face from its underlying tissue, moving downto the cheek and into the neck area and below the chin. Fatdeposits over the cheeks and in the neck may be removedsurgically or with liposuction at this time. The surgeon"
"will then work to free up and tighten certain bands of mus-cle and tissue that extend up from the shoulder, below thechin, and up and behind the neck. If these muscles and tis-sue are not tightened, the looseness and sagging appear-ance of the skin will return. The surgeon then trims excessskin from the edges of the original incision, pulls the skinback, and staples or sutures it into place.
Preparation
Prior to the procedure, patients meet with their sur-
geon to discuss the surgery, clarify the results that can beachieved, and discuss the potential problems that canoccur. Having realistic expectations is important in anycosmetic procedure. Patients will learn, for example, thatalthough face lift surgery can improve the contour of theface and neck, other procedures will be necessary toreduce the appearance of many wrinkles.

earlier, patients will stop taking aspirin, birth control or
female hormones, and other medications affecting bloodclotting about two weeks before the procedure. Somephysicians prescribe vitamin C and K in the belief thatthis promotes healing. Patients will also be advised tostop smoking and to avoid exposure to passive smoke
before the procedure and afterward. Some surgeons alsorecommend antibiotics be taken beforehand to limit the
risk of infection. Some surgeons also use a steroid injec-tion before or after the procedure, to reduce swelling.

"Aftercare
After the surgery, a pressure bandage will be applied
to the face to reduce the risk of hematoma. The patientmay spend a few hours resting in a recovery room toensure no bleeding has occurred. The patient then returnshome. Some surgeons recommend that the patient remainreclining for the next 24 hours, consuming a liquid diet,and avoiding any movements that lead the neck to flex. Icepacks for the first few days can help to reduce swellingand lower the risk of hematoma. Patients continue takingan antibiotic until the first stitches come out about fivedays after the procedure. The balance are removed seven
to 10 days later. Many patients return to work and limitedactivities within two weeks of the procedure.

"Risks
The major complication seen following face lift
surgery is a hematoma. If a hematoma forms, the patientmay have to return to have the stitches reopened to findthe source of the bleeding. Most hematomas form within48 hours of surgery. The typical sign is pain or swellingaffecting one side of the face but not the other.
Another risk of face lift surgery is nerve damage.
Sometimes it can affect the patient’s ability to raise aneyebrow, or distort his smile, or leave him with limitedfeeling in his earlobe. Most of these nerve injuries, how-ever, repair themselves within 2–6 months.
Normal results
Some swelling and bruising is normal following face
lift surgery. After these disappear, the patient should seea noticeable improvement in the contour of his face andneck. Some fine wrinkling of the skin may be improved,but deep wrinkles are likely to require another cosmeticprocedure to improve their appearance.

"Factitious disorders
Definition
Factitious disorders are a group of mental distur-
bances in which patients intentionally act physically ormentally ill without obvious benefits. The name facti-tious comes from a Latin word that means artificial.These disorders are not malingering , which is defined as
pretending illness when the “patient” has a clear motive,such as financial gain.
Description
Patients with factitious disorders produce or exag-
gerate the symptoms of a physical or mental illness by avariety of methods, including contaminating urine sam-ples with blood, taking hallucinogens, injecting them-selves with bacteria to produce infections, and other sim-ilar behaviors.
There are no reliable statistics on the frequency of
factitious disorders, but they are more common in menthan in women. The following conditions are sometimesclassified as factitious disorders:

"Munchausen syndrome
Munchausen syndrome refers to patients whose
factitious symptoms are dramatized and exaggerated.Many persons with Munchausen go so far as to undergomajor surgery repeatedly, and, to avoid detection, at sev-eral locations. Many have been employed in hospitals orin health care professions. The syndrome’s onset is inearly adulthood.
Munchausen by proxy
Munchausen by proxy is the name given to facti-
tious disorders in children produced by parents orother caregivers. The parent may falsify the child’smedical history or tamper with laboratory tests inorder to make the child appear sick. Occasionally, theymay actually injure the child to assure that the childwill be treated.
Ganser’s syndrome
Ganser’s syndrome is an unusual dissociative reac-
tion to extreme stress in which the patient gives absurd
or silly answers to simple questions. It has sometimesbeen labeled as psychiatric malingering, but is moreoften classified as a factitious disorder.
Causes and symptoms"
"Causes and symptoms
No single explanation of factitious disorders covers
all cases. These disorders are variously attributed tounderlying personality disorders ; child abuse ; the wish
to repeat a satisfying childhood relationship with a doc-tor; and the desire to deceive or test authority figures.Also, the wish to assume the role of patient and be caredfor is involved. In many cases, the suffering of a majorpersonal loss has been implicated.
The following are regarded as indications of a facti-
tious disorder:
• dramatic but inconsistent medical history• extensive knowledge of medicine and/or hospitals• negative test results followed by further symptom
development
• symptoms that occur only when the patient is not being
observed
• few visitors• arguments with hospital staff or similar acting-out
behaviors
• eagerness to undergo operations and other procedures
When patients with factitious disorders are confront-"
"When patients with factitious disorders are confront-
ed, they usually deny that their symptoms are intentional.They may become angry and leave the hospital. In manycases they enter another hospital, which has led to thenickname “hospital hoboes.”
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1277Factitious disorders"
"Diagnosis
Diagnosis of factitious disorders is usually based on
the exclusion of bona fide medical or psychiatric condi-tions, together with a combination of the signs listed ear-lier. In some cases, the diagnosis is made on the basis ofrecords from other hospitals.
Treatment
Treatment of factitious disorders is usually limited
to prompt recognition of the condition and the refusal togive unnecessary medications or to perform unneededprocedures. Factitious disorder patients do not usuallyremain in the hospital long enough for effective psychi-atric treatment. Some clinicians have tried psychothera-peutic treatment for factitious disorder patients, and thereare anecdotal reports that antidepressant or antipsychoticmedications are helpful in certain cases.
Prognosis
Some patients have only one or two episodes of fac-
titious disorders; others develop a chronic form that maybe lifelong. Successful treatment of the chronic formappears to be rare.

Failure to thrive
Definition
Failure to thrive (FTT) is used to describe a delay in
a child’s growth or development. It is usually applied toinfants and children up to two years of age who do notgain or maintain weight as they should. Failure to thriveis not a specific disease, but rather a cluster of symptomswhich may come from a variety of sources.
Description
Shortly after birth most infants loose some weight."
"Description
Shortly after birth most infants loose some weight.
After that expected loss, babies should gain weight at asteady and predictable rate. When a baby does not gainweigh as expected, or continues to loose weight, it is notthriving. Failure to thrive may be due to one or moreconditions.
Organic failure to thrive (OFTT) implies that the
organs involved with digestion and absorption of foodare malformed or incomplete so the baby cannot digestits food.

"Causes and symptoms
Occasionally, there may be an underlying physical
condition that inhibits the baby’s ability to take in, digest,or process food. These defects can occur in the esopha-gus, stomach, small or large intestine, rectum or anus.Usually the defect is an incomplete development of theorgan, and it must be surgically corrected. Most physicaldefects can be detected shortly after birth.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1278Failure to thrive"
"Failure to thrive may also result from lack of avail-
able food or the quality of the food offered. This can bedue to economic factors in the family, parental beliefs andconcepts of nutrition , or neglect of the child. In addition,
if the baby is being breast fed, the quality or quantity ofthe mother’s milk may be the source of the problem.
Psychosocial problems, often stemming from a lack
of nurturing parent-child relations can lead to a failure tothrive. The child may exhibit poor appetite due to depres-sion from insufficient attention from parents.
Infants and toddlers, whose growth is substantially
less than expected, are considered to be suffering fromFTT.

"Diagnosis
Most babies are weighed at birth and that weight is
used as a base line for future well-baby check-ups. If thebaby is not gaining weight at a predictable rate, the doc-tor will do a more extensive examination. If there are noapparent physical deformities in the digestive tract, thedoctor will examine the child’s environment. As part ofthat examination, the doctor will look at the family histo-ry of height and weight. In addition, the parents will beasked about feedings, illnesses, and family routines. Ifthe mother is breastfeeding the doctor will also evaluateher diet, general health, and well being as it affects thequantity and quality of her milk.
Diagnosis of FTT is confirmed by a positive growth
and behavioral response to increased nutrition.

"Treatment
If there is an underlying physical reason for failure
to thrive, such as a disorder of swallowing mechanism orintestinal problems, correcting that problem shouldreverse the condition. If the condition is caused by envi-ronmental factors, the physician will suggest severalways parents may provide adequate food for the child.Maternal education and parental counseling may also berecommended. In extreme cases, hospitalization or amore nurturing home may be necessary.
Prognosis
The first year of life is important as a foundation for
growth and physical and intellectual development in thefuture. Children with extreme failure to thrive in the firstyear may never catch up to their peers even if their physi-cal growth improves. In about one third of these extremecases, mental development remains below normal androughly half will continue to have psychosocial and eat-ing problems throughout life.KEY TERMS

Psychosocial —A term referring to the mind’s abili-

When failure to thrive is identified and corrected

Prevention
Initial failure to thrive caused by physical defects
cannot be prevented but can often be corrected beforethey become a danger to the child. Maternal educationand emotional and economic support systems all help toprevent failure to thrive in those cases where there is nophysical deformity.

Fainting
Definition
Fainting is loss of consciousness caused by a tempo-
rary lack of oxygen to the brain. Known by the medicalterm “syncope,” fainting may be preceded by dizziness ,
nausea, or a feeling of extreme weakness.
Description
When a person faints, the loss of consciousness is
brief. The person will wake up as soon as normal bloodflow is restored to the brain. Blood flow is usually
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1279Fainting"
"restored by lying flat for a short time. This position puts
the head on the same level as the heart so that bloodflows more easily to the brain.
A fainting episode may be completely harmless and
of no significance, but it can be a symptom of a seriousunderlying disorder. No matter how trivial it seems, afainting episode should be treated as a medical emer-gency until the cause is determined.
Causes and symptoms
Extreme pain , fear, or stress may bring on fainting.
This type of fainting is caused by overstimulation of thevagus nerve, a nerve connected to the brain that helps con-trol breathing and circulation. In addition, a person whostands still or erect for too long may faint. This type offainting occurs because blood pools in the leg veins,reducing the amount that is available for the heart to pumpto the brain. This type of fainting is quite common in olderpeople or those taking drugs to treat high blood pressure.
When an older person feels faint upon turning the"
"When an older person feels faint upon turning the
head or looking upward suddenly, the cause could beosteoarthritis of the neck bones. Osteoarthritis damages
the cartilage between the neck bones and causes pressureon blood vessels leading to the brain.
Fainting can be a symptom of a disease such as
Stokes-Adams syndrome, a condition in which bloodflow to the brain is temporarily reduced because of anirregular heartbeat. Some people may experience faintingassociated with weakness in the limbs or a temporary
problem in speaking caused by obstructed blood flow invessels passing through the neck to the brain. Pregnantwomen frequently feel faint. Fainting may also occur as aresult of low blood sugar. Low blood sugar can occur if aperson skips a meal or has diabetes.
Fainting can also be caused by:
• prolonged coughing
• straining to defecate or urinate• blowing a wind instrument too hard
• remaining in a stuffy environment with too little oxygen"
"• remaining in a stuffy environment with too little oxygen
Sometimes fainting may be caused by a temporary
drop in the blood supply to the brain caused by a tran-
sient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA, sometimes called a
mini-stroke, is a disruption in the blood supply to thebrain caused by a blocked or burst blood vessel. Seekhelp immediately if a fainting spell is followed by one ormore of the symptoms listed below:
• numbness or tingling in any body part
• blurred vision
• confusion• difficulty speaking
• loss of movement in arms or legs
A few seconds before fainting, a person may sweat
or become pale, feel nauseated or dizzy, and have blurredvision or racing heartbeat. Once the person loses con-sciousness, the pupils may dilate as the heart rate slowsdown. There may be abnormal movements. Muscles maytighten or the back may arch. These movements do notlast long and they are not violent.
In most cases, the patient regains consciousness"
"In most cases, the patient regains consciousness
within a few minutes, but the fainting spell may be fol-lowed by nervousness, headache , nausea, dizziness, pal-
lor or sweating. The person may faint again, especially ifhe or she stands up within 30 minutes.
Diagnosis
Most episodes of fainting are a one-time occurrence.
When a person experiences repeated fainting spells, aphysician should be consulted.
Treatment
Most of the time, a person who faints ends up lying
on the floor. If this happens, the patient should be rolledonto his or her back. Because someone who faints oftenvomits, bystanders should keep the airway open. A per-son who is fainting should not be held upright or in a sit-ting position. These positions prevent blood flow to thebrain and may bring on a seizure.

vented by sitting with the head between the knees, asshown in the illustration above, or by lying flat with the legsraised. Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)"
"Bystanders should check the patient’s breathing and
pulse rate. The pulse may be weak and slow. If there areno signs of breathing or heart rate, the problem is moreserious than fainting, and cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion (CPR ) must begin.
If breathing and pulse rates seem normal, the person’s
legs should be raised above the level of the head so thatgravity can help the blood flow to the brain. Belts, collarsor any other constrictive clothing should be loosened.
If the person does not regain consciousness within a
minute or two after fainting, medical help should besummoned.
Prognosis
After a fainting spell, the person should regain nor-
mal color but may continue to feel weak for a short time.Lying down quietly for a few moments may help.
In most cases, an attack of fainting is not serious. As
soon as the underlying pain or stress passes, the dangerof repeated episodes also is eliminated.

Familial Mediterranean fever
Definition
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an inherited
disorder of the inflammatory response characterized byrecurring attacks of fever, accompanied by intense pain"
"in the abdomen, chest, or joints. Attacks usually last12–72 hours, and can occasionally involve a skin rash.Kidney disease is a serious concern if the disorder is nottreated. FMF is most prevalent in people of Armenian,Sephardic-Jewish, Arabic, and Turkish ancestry.
Description
FMF could be described as a disorder of “inappro-
priate” inflammation. That is, an event that in a normalsituation causes a mild or unnoticeable inflammationmight cause a severe inflammatory response in someonewith FMF. Certain areas of the body are at risk for FMF-related symptoms. A serosa is a serous (fluid-producing)membrane that can be found inside the abdominal cavity(peritoneum), around the lungs (pleura), around the heart(pericardium), and inside the joints (synovium). Thesymptoms of FMF are due to inflammation of one ormore of the serosal membranes (serositis). Thus, FMF isalso sometimes called recurrent polyserositis.
During an attack, large numbers of neutrophils, a"
"During an attack, large numbers of neutrophils, a
type of white blood cell, move into the affected areas

"causing painful inflammation and fever. These
episodes may be accompanied by a skin rash or jointpain. In a few cases, chronic arthritis is a problem.Amyloidosis is a potentially serious condition in
which proteins called amyloids are mistakenly pro-duced and deposited in organs and tissues throughoutthe body. Left untreated, amyloidosis often leads tokidney failure, which is the major long-term healthrisk in FMF.
In most cases, the attacks of fever and pain are first
noticed in childhood or adolescence. The intervalbetween these episodes may be days or months, and isnot predictable. However, during these intervals peoplewith FMF typically lead normal lives. It is not entirelyclear what brings on an attack, but people with FMFoften report mild physical trauma, physical exertion, oremotional stress just prior to the onset of symptoms."
"Treatment for FMF involves an oral medication calledcolchicine, which is highly effective for the episodes offever and pain, as well as for amyloidosis and the kidneydisease that can result from it.
FMF is most common in certain ethnic groups from
the eastern Mediterranean region, but cases in other eth-nic groups in other parts of the world are increasinglybeing reported. FMF is also known by many othernames. They include: recurrent hereditary polyserositis,benign paroxysmal peritonitis , familial paroxysmal pol-
yserositis, paroxysmal polyserositis, familial recurrentpolyserositis, periodic fever, periodic amyloid syndrome,periodic peritonitis syndrome, Reimann periodic disease,Reimann syndrome, Siegel-Cattan-Mamou syndrome,and Armenian syndrome.
Estimates of the incidence of FMF in specific east-"
"ern Mediterranean populations range from 1 in 2000 to 1in 100, depending on the population studied. Specificmutations in the MEFV gene are more common in cer-tain ethnic groups, and may cause a somewhat differentcourse of the disease. A few mutations in the MEFVgene likely became common in a small population in theeastern Mediterranean several thousand years ago. It ispostulated that carrying a single copy of a mutated geneproduced a modified (but not abnormal) inflammatoryresponse that may have been protective against someinfectious agent at that time. Those who carried a single“beneficial” mutation in the MEFV gene were more like-ly to survive and reproduce, which may explain the highcarrier frequency (up to one in five) in some populations.People of Armenian, Sephardic-Jewish, Arabic, andTurkish ancestry are at greatest risk for FMF. However, abetter understanding and recognition of the symptoms ofFMF in recent years has resulted in more reports of thecondition in other ethnic"
"of the symptoms ofFMF in recent years has resulted in more reports of thecondition in other ethnic groups, such as Italians andArmenian-Americans.Causes and symptoms"
"FMF is a genetic condition inherited in an autosomal
recessive fashion. Mutations in the MEFV gene (shortfor Mediterranean Fever) on chromosome number 16 arethe underlying cause of FMF. Autosomal recessive inher-itance implies that a person with FMF has mutations inboth copies of the MEFV gene. All genes come in pairs,and one copy of each pair is inherited from each parent.If neither parent of a child with FMF has the condition, itmeans they carry one mutated copy of the MEFV gene,but also one normal copy, which is enough to protectthem from disease. If both parents carry the same autoso-mal recessive gene, there is a one in four chance in eachpregnancy that the child will inherit both recessive
genes, and thus have the condition.
The MEFV gene carries the instructions for produc-"
"tion of a protein called pyrin, named for pyrexia, a med-ical term for fever. The research group in France that co-discovered the protein named it marenostrin, after ancientLatin words that referred to the Mediterranean Sea. Themovement of neutrophils into an area of the body wheretrauma or infection has occurred is the major cause ofinflammation, which is a normal process. Research hasshown that pyrin has some function in controlling neu-trophils. In a situation where minor trauma or stressoccurs, some initial inflammation may follow, but a func-tional pyrin protein is responsible for shutting-down theresponse of neutrophils once they are no longer needed.An abnormal pyrin protein associated with FMF may bepartly functional, but unstable. In some instances, theabnormal pyrin itself seems to be “stressed”, and loses itsability to regulate neutrophils and inflammation. Leftunregulated, a normal, mild inflammation spirals out ofcontrol.

"a normal, mild inflammation spirals out ofcontrol. Exactly what causes pyrin in FMF to lose its abil-ity to control neutrophils in some situations is not known."
"The recurrent acute attacks of FMF typically begin
in childhood or adolescence. Episodes of fever andpainful inflammation usually last 12–72 hours. About90% of people with FMF have their first attack by age20. The group of symptoms that characterizes FMFincludes the following:
Fever
An FMF attack is nearly always accompanied by a
fever, but it may not be noticed in every case. Fevers aretypically 100–104°F (38–40°C). Some people experi-ence chills prior to the onset of fever.
Abdominal pain

pain at one point or another, and for most it is the most

"common complaint. The pain can range from mild to
severe, and can be diffuse or localized. It can mimicappendicitis , and many people with undiagnosed FMF
have had appendectomies or exploratory surgery of theabdomen done, only to have the fever and abdominalpain return.
Chest pain
Pleuritis, also called pleurisy , occurs in up to half of
the affected individuals in certain ethnic groups. Thepain is usually on one side of the chest. Pericarditis
would also be felt as chest pain.
Joint pain
About 50% of people with FMF experience joint
pain during attacks. The pain is usually confined to onejoint at a time, and often involves the hip, knee, or ankle.For some people, however, the recurrent joint painbecomes chronic arthritis.
Myalgia
Up to 20% of individuals report muscle pain. These
episodes typically last less than two days, and tend tooccur in the evening or after physical exertion. Rarecases of muscle pain and fever lasting up to one monthhave been reported.KEY TERMS"

"Amyloidosis
FMF is associated with high levels in the blood of
a protein called serum amyloid A (SAA). Over time,excess SAA tends to be deposited in tissues and organsthroughout the body. The presence and deposition ofexcess SAA is known as amyloidosis. Amyloidosismay affect the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen,heart, and testes, but effects on the kidneys are ofgreatest concern. The frequency of amyloidosis variesamong the different ethnic groups, and its overall inci-dence is difficult to determine because of the use ofcolchicine to avert the problem. Left untreated, howev-er, those individuals who do develop amyloidosis ofthe kidneys may require a renal transplant, or may evendie of renal failure. The frequency and severity of aperson’s attacks of fever and serositis seem to have norelation to whether they will develop amyloidosis. Infact, a few people with FMF have been described whohave had amyloidosis but apparently no other FMF-related symptoms."
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1283Familial Mediterranean fever
"Other symptoms
A small percentage of boys with FMF develop
painful inflammation around the testes, headaches are acommon occurrence during attacks, and certain types ofvasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) seem to be
more common in FMF.
Diagnosis
Individually, the symptoms that define FMF are com-
mon. Fevers occur for many reasons, and nonspecificpains in the abdomen, chest, and joints are also frequentailments. Several infections can result in symptoms simi-lar to FMF (Mallaret meningitis , for instance), and many
people with FMF undergo exploratory abdominal surgeryand ineffective treatments before they are finally diag-nosed. Membership in a less commonly affected ethnicgroup may delay or hinder the correct diagnosis.
In general, symptoms involving one or more of the"
"In general, symptoms involving one or more of the
following broad groups should lead to suspicion of FMF:Unexplained recurrent fevers, polyserositis, skin rash,and/or joint pain; abnormal blood studies (see below);and renal or other disease associated with amyloidosis. Afamily history of FMF or its symptoms would obviouslybe an important clue, but the recessive nature of FMFmeans there usually is no family history. The diagnosismay be confirmed when a person with unexplained feverand pain responds to treatment with colchicine sincecolchicine is not known to have a beneficial effect on anyother condition similar to FMF. Abnormal results on ablood test typically include leukocytosis (elevated num-
ber of neutrophils in the blood), an increased erythro-
cyte sedimentation rate (rate at which red blood cells
form a sediment in a blood sample), and increased levelsof proteins associated with inflammation (called acutephase reactants) such as SAA."
"Direct analysis of the MEFV gene for FMF muta-
tions is the only method to be certain of the diagnosis.However, it is not yet possible to detect all MEFV genemutations that might cause FMF. Thus, if DNA analysisis negative, clinical methods must be relied upon. If bothmembers of a couple were proven to be FMF carriersthrough genetic testing , highly accurate prenatal diagno-
sis would be available in any subsequent pregnancy.
Similar syndromes of periodic fever and inflamma-
tion include familial Hibernian fever and hyperim-munoglobulinemia D syndrome, but both are more rarethan FMF.
Treatment
Colchicine is a chemical compound that can be used
as a medication, and is frequently prescribed for gout .Some years ago, colchicine was discovered to also be"
"effective in reducing the frequency and severity ofattacks in FMF. Treatment for FMF at this point consistsof taking colchicine daily. Studies have shown that about75% of FMF patients achieve complete remission oftheir symptoms, and about 95% show marked improve-ment when taking colchicine. Lower effectiveness hasbeen reported, but there is some question about the num-ber of FMF patients who choose not to take theircolchicine between attacks when they are feeling well,and thus lose some of the ability to prevent attacks. Com-pliance with taking colchicine every day may be ham-pered by its side effects, which include diarrhea , nausea,"
"abdominal bloating, and gas. There is a theoretical riskthat colchicine use could damage chromosomes insperms and eggs, or in an embryo during pregnancy, orthat it might reduce fertility. However, studies looking atreproduction in men and women who have usedcolchicine have so far not shown any increased risks.Colchicine is also effective in preventing, delaying, orreversing renal disease associated with amyloidosis.
Other medications may be used as needed to deal
with the pain and fever associated with FMF attacks.Dialysis and/or renal transplant might become necessaryin someone with advanced kidney disease. Given itsgenetic nature, there is no cure for FMF, nor is there likelyto be in the near future. Any couple that has a child diag-nosed with FMF, or anyone with a family history of thecondition (especially those in high-risk ethnic groups),should be offered genetic counseling to obtain the most
up-to-date information on FMF and testing options.
Prognosis"
"up-to-date information on FMF and testing options.
Prognosis
For those individuals who are diagnosed early
enough and take colchicine consistently, the prognosis isexcellent. Most will have very few, if any, attacks offever and polyserositis, and will likely not develop seri-ous complications of amyloidosis. The problem of misdi-agnosing FMF continues, but education attempts directedat both the public and medical care providers shouldimprove the situation. Future research should provide abetter understanding of the inflammation process, focus-ing on how neutrophils are genetically regulated. Thatinformation could then be used to develop treatments forFMF with fewer side effects, and might also assist indeveloping therapies for other diseases in which abnor-mal inflammation and immune response are a problem.

Familial polyposis
Definition
Familial polyposis is an inherited condition which
primarily affects the large intestine (colon and rectum).Large numbers of projecting masses of swollen andthickened or tumorous membrane (polyps) develop onthe inner lining of this part of the bowel. The polypseventually become malignant.

Becausethese mushroom-like growths are the most obvious mani-festation of the disorder, the word, polyp, is usually inthe term as well. Adenoma refers to the particular kind ofpolyp that is typically discovered. Some of the namesfound in medical texts and journals include polyposiscoli, familial colonic polyposis, multiple familial polypo-sis, familial adenomatous colon polyposis, adenomatosisof the colon and rectum (ACR), and familial adenoma-tous polyposis (FAP).

FAP can also develop in someone withno family history of the disorder, due to a new geneticmutation in that individual.

"Causes and symptoms
FAP is caused by a portion of a gene that mutates or
changes. The original cause of the mutation is unknown.Its exact role in FAP is not completely clear. Researcherstheorize that the normal gene directs the manufacture ofa protein which helps control cell growth. The mutatedgene section in FAP generates an abnormal proteinwhich does not perform its normal function. Cells growout of control, causing the development of multiple,sometimes hundreds, of polyps. One or more of theseeventually becomes cancerous.
Many individuals develop polyps without display-
ing any symptoms. Others experience such gastrointesti-nal problems as diarrhea ,constipation , abdominal
cramps, blood in the stool, or weight loss. FAP patientsmay also develop nonmalignant tumors (desmoidtumors), and/or some bone and dental abnormalities. Inaddition, they may exhibit a “spot” on the retina of theeye (congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigmentepithelium, or CHRPE)."
"Relatives of individuals with diagnosed FAP are at
high risk of having the disease themselves. There are noother known risk factors for this condition.

"Diagnosis
The abnormal portion of the gene that causes FAP in
most patients can be detected. A blood test can then beperformed which identifies family members who have thesame mutation. They will eventually develop the condi-tion. Children who have a parent with FAP, and siblings ofaffected patients whose parental history is incomplete,should be evaluated. The polyps characteristic of FAPhave been found in children as young as age five. Testingof appropriate individuals should take place as soon as thediagnosis of FAP is established in one member of a family.
Relatives of people with diagnosed FAP should
exercise caution regarding where they seek advice and
testing. One study of a commercially available blood testfound that less than 20% of patients received any genetic
counseling , and almost one third of their physicians mis-
interpreted the test results.

sites in the United States. Such a registry specializes inidentification, assistance, and education of people with aparticular disease, and is usually a separate department ina research hospital. A team of health professionals whohave expertise in the disorder staff the registry.
Testing within a research setting and/or at a facility
with a registry of patients with FAP is more likely tosafeguard against problems, such as the misunderstand-ing of test results. As part of a research project, some-times counseling as well as blood tests are available at nocharge to the patient. Insurance coverage varies. Con-cerns about confidentiality, and future insurance andemployment discrimination, may prompt individuals topay for the examination out of pocket. Commercial bloodtests cost approximately $250 per sample.
If the abnormal gene is found in a family member,"
"If the abnormal gene is found in a family member,
annual screening for colon polyps is recommended,beginning at age 11. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is used for
this examination. It is usually done in a physician’soffice, or in a hospital department, most often by a gas-troenterologist or a surgeon. Food intake may be restrict-ed for 24 hours prior to the procedure. Before the study,the intestine is cleared of stool by one or more small ene-
mas. Some physicians prefer to sedate the patient, to
help them relax. Then a flexible, lighted, hollow tube(sigmoidoscope) is inserted into the anus and maneu-vered into the large intestine. The physician examines thewall of the colon to look for polyps. If polyps are found,one or more may be removed for biopsy.

"Most patients report little discomfort during the
examination. The procedure itself takes five to fifteenminutes. The patient may be at the facility an hour, ormore, if recovery from sedation is needed. If no medica-tion was administered, driving and resumption of normal
activities are permitted immediately. The cost of the pro-cedure varies widely, but, as of 1997, it was covered byMedicare, indicating the likelihood of other types ofinsurance coverage.
In some cases the portion of the gene responsible for
FAP cannot be identified. Family members of thesepatients cannot have a predictive blood test. The currentrecommendation is for these patients to have the sameannual examination with flexible sigmoidoscopy aspatients with a diagnosed FAP gene. A noninvasivescreening eye examination to detect CHRPE, associated
with FAP, may also be performed.

"with FAP, may also be performed.
Treatment
The only definitive treatment for FAP is surgical
removal of the lower intestine. Since the goal is to pre-vent cancer, the operation is done as soon as adenoma-tous polyps are found on sigmoidoscopy. Waiting until apolyp becomes malignant is unsafe, as the cancer mayinvade surrounding tissues.
There are several choices about the type of surgery to
treat this condition. Some authorities advocate removal ofthe colon, leaving the rectum or lowest portion of theintestine in place. The small intestine can be attached tothe rectum, allowing normal bowel function. This is oftencalled ileorectal anastomosis. Others argue that this sec-tion is also liable to develop polyps, needs to be moni-tored regularly, and may require eventual removal.
Excision of the entire lower intestine with preserva-"
"Excision of the entire lower intestine with preserva-
tion of normal bowel function is possible. This entails amore complex surgical procedure. The patient may expe-rience more complications and a longer recovery period.However, the risk of polyp development in this area isvery low. Periodic examination of the intestine may notbe needed once healing is complete.
The more intricate surgery may be referred to as a J-
pouch procedure, an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, arestorative proctocolectomy, or an ileoanal reservoir proce-dure. It involves creating a “pouch” of tissue from the smallintestine, which is attached to the anus. This serves as areservoir or holding area for stool, much as the rectum doesnormally. The surgery is often done in several stages. Atemporary ileostomy, which creates an opening of the smallintestines onto the abdomen, is required. When all proce-dures are completed, and after a recuperation period, thepatient regains normal bowel function through the anus."
"Some researchers suggest that as genetic testing
becomes more developed, the specific portion of thegene involved may dictate the type of surgery chosen.Those at high risk of developing rectal polyps may be
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1286Familial polyposis"
"advised to have the more complex operation. FAP
patients felt to be at lower risk for rectal polyps might becounseled to consider the less radical surgery.
Medical therapy to treat the adenomatous polyps has
been attempted. Some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs have been effective in reducing the number and
size of the polyps. It is possible that these agents will beused as an additional treatment for FAP, but they areunlikely to replace surgery.
Individuals with FAP are at increased risk for cancers"
"Individuals with FAP are at increased risk for cancers
of the upper digestive tract including the upper portion ofthe small bowel (dudodenum) and the channels wherebile flows (biliary tract). Cancers of the thyroid, pancreas,and adrenal gland are also more commonly found amongFAP patients. Periodic examination for the developmentof malignancy in these areas is considered part of thetreatment of FAP. In some cases, such as cancer involvingthe duodenum, the tests themselves carry a chance ofcomplications. The risk of the study must be weighedagainst the potential benefits of knowing the results. Non-malignant growths, called desmoid tumors, also occurmore frequently in patients with FAP. Although they arenot malignant, they grow quickly into surrounding tis-sues, causing many difficulties, even death in some cases.
Prognosis
The major cause of death in many patients with FAP"
"Prognosis
The major cause of death in many patients with FAP
remains colorectal cancer. One study suggested that evenwith improved disease recognition, social and emotionalfactors, such as fear of surgery, may significantly delay apatient’s treatment. In recent years, the trend is towardsmortality from other causes, such as desmoid tumors orcancers other than colorectal. It has been estimated that apatient with known FAP has a relative risk of dying overthree times greater than that of the average population, ata given age.
Prevention
FAP cannot be prevented. Aggressive diagnosis,
treatment, and follow-up monitoring are keys to success-ful management of the disease.

Family therapy
Definition
Family therapy is a form of psychotherapy that
involves all the members of a nuclear or extended family.It may be conducted by a pair or team of therapists. Inmany cases the team consists of a man and a woman inorder to treat gender-related issues or serve as role mod-els for family members. Although some forms of familytherapy are based on behavioral or psychodynamic prin-ciples, the most widespread form is based on family sys-tems theory. This approach regards the family, as awhole, as the unit of treatment, and emphasizes such fac-tors as relationships and communication patterns ratherthan traits or symptoms in individual members."
"Family therapy is a relatively recent development in
psychotherapy. It began shortly after World War II, whendoctors, who were treating schizophrenic patients,noticed that the patients’ families communicated in dis-turbed ways. The doctors also found that the patients’symptoms rose or fell according to the level of tensionbetween their parents. These observations led to consid-ering a family as an organism or system with its owninternal rules, patterns of functioning, and tendency toresist change. The therapists started to treat the familiesof schizophrenic patients as whole units rather thanfocusing on the hospitalized member. They found that inmany cases the family member with schizophrenia"
"improved when the “patient” was the family system.(This should not be misunderstood to mean that schizo-phrenia is caused by family problems, although familyproblems may worsen the condition.) This approach ofinvolving the entire family in the treatment plan and ther-apy was then applied to families with problems otherthan the presence of schizophrenia.
Family therapy is becoming an increasingly com-
mon form of treatment as changes in American societyare reflected in family structures. It has led to two furtherdevelopments: couples therapy, which treats relationship
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1287Family therapy"
"problems between marriage partners or gay couples; and
the extension of family therapy to religious communitiesor other groups that resemble families.
Purpose
Family therapy is often recommended in the follow-
ing situations:
• Treatment of a family member with schizophrenia or
multiple personality disorder (MPD). Family therapy
helps other family members understand their relative’sdisorder and adjust to the psychological changes thatmay be occurring in the relative.
• Families with problems across generational boundaries.
These would include problems caused by parents shar-ing housing with grandparents, or children being rearedby grandparents.
• Families that deviate from social norms (common-law
relationships, gay couples rearing children, etc.). Thesefamilies may not have internal problems but may betroubled by outsiders’ judgmental attitudes.
• Families with members from a mixture of racial, cultur-
al, or religious backgrounds.
• Families who are scapegoating a member or undermin-"
"al, or religious backgrounds.
• Families who are scapegoating a member or undermin-
ing the treatment of a member in individual therapy.
• Families where the identified patient’s problems seem
inextricably tied to problems with other family members.
• Blended families with adjustment difficulties.
Most family therapists presuppose an average level
of intelligence and education on the part of adult mem-bers of the family.
Precautions
Some families are not considered suitable candidates
for family therapy. They include:
• families in which one, or both, of the parents is psy-
chotic or has been diagnosed with antisocial or para-noid personality disorder,
• families whose cultural or religious values are opposed
to, or suspicious of, psychotherapy,
• families with members who cannot participate in treat-
ment sessions because of physical illness or similarlimitations,
• families with members with very rigid personality"
"• families with members with very rigid personality
structures, (here, members might be at risk for an emo-tional or psychological crisis),
• families whose members cannot or will not be able to
meet regularly for treatment,
• families that are unstable or on the verge of breakup.Description
Family therapy tends to be short-term treatment, usu-
ally several months in length, with a focus on resolvingspecific problems such as eating disorders, difficultieswith school, or adjustments to bereavement or geographi-cal relocation. It is not normally used for long-term orintensive restructuring of severely dysfunctional families.
In family therapy sessions, all members of the family"
"In family therapy sessions, all members of the family
and both therapists (if there is more than one) are present atmost sessions. The therapists seek to analyze the process offamily interaction and communication as a whole; they donot take sides with specific members. They may make occa-sional comments or remarks intended to help family mem-bers become more conscious of patterns or structures thathad been previously taken for granted. Family therapists,who work as a team, also model new behaviors for the fami-ly through their interactions with each other during sessions.
Family therapy is based on family systems theory,"
"Family therapy is based on family systems theory,
which understands the family to be a living organism thatis more than the sum of its individual members. Familytherapy uses “systems” theory to evaluate family membersin terms of their position or role within the system as awhole. Problems are treated by changing the way the sys-tem works rather than trying to “fix” a specific member.Family systems theory is based on several major concepts:
The identified patient
The identified patient (IP) is the family member with
the symptom that has brought the family into treatment.The concept of the IP is used by family therapists to keepthe family from scapegoating the IP or using him or heras a way of avoiding problems in the rest of the system.
Homeostasis (balance)
The concept of homeostasis means that the family"
"Homeostasis (balance)
The concept of homeostasis means that the family
system seeks to maintain its customary organization andfunctioning over time. It tends to resist change. The fami-ly therapist can use the concept of homeostasis to explainwhy a certain family symptom has surfaced at a giventime, why a specific member has become the IP, and whatis likely to happen when the family begins to change.
The extended family field
The extended family field refers to the nuclear fami-
ly, plus the network of grandparents and other membersof the extended family. This concept is used to explainthe intergenerational transmission of attitudes, problems,behaviors, and other issues.
Differentiation
Differentiation refers to the ability of each family
member to maintain his or her own sense of self, while

"remaining emotionally connected to the family. One
mark of a healthy family is its capacity to allow membersto differentiate, while family members still feel that theyare “members in good standing” of the family.
Triangular relationships
Family systems theory maintains that emotional rela-
tionships in families are usually triangular. Whenever anytwo persons in the family system have problems with eachother, they will “triangle in” a third member as a way of sta-bilizing their own relationship. The triangles in a family sys-tem usually interlock in a way that maintains family home-ostasis. Common family triangles include a child and itsparents; two children and one parent; a parent, a child, and agrandparent; three siblings; or, husband, wife, and an in-law.

"Preparation
In some instances the family may have been referred
to a specialist in family therapy by their pediatrician orother primary care provider. It is estimated that as many as50% of office visits to pediatricians have to do with devel-opmental problems in children that are affecting their fam-ilies.

"Family therapists may be either psychiatrists, clinical
psychologists, or other professionals certified by a spe-cialty board in marriage and family therapy. They willusually evaluate a family for treatment by scheduling aseries of interviews with the members of the immediatefamily, including young children, and significant orsymptomatic members of the extended family. Thisprocess allows the therapist(s) to find out how each mem-ber of the family sees the problem, as well as to form firstimpressions of the family’s functioning. Family therapiststypically look for the level and types of emotionsexpressed, patterns of dominance and submission, theroles played by family members, communication styles,and the locations of emotional triangles. They will alsonote whether these patterns are rigid or relatively flexible.

Fanconi’s syndrome
Definition
Fanconi’s syndrome is a set of kidney malfunctions"
"Fanconi’s syndrome
Definition
Fanconi’s syndrome is a set of kidney malfunctions
brought about by a variety of seemingly unrelated disor-ders. Kidney malfunction leads to excessive urine produc-tion and excessive thirst, resulting in deficits of water, cal-cium, potassium, magnesium, and other substances in thebody. It often leads to bone disease and stunted growth.
Description
Normally, kidneys cleanse the blood and keep its
salt, water, and acidity in balance, leaving what the bodyneeds in the blood and putting what the body doesn’tneed into the urine, which leaves the body. This task isperformed in two steps. First, the blood is filteredthrough a kidney structure with small holes that keep thecells and large molecules in the blood. Second, some ofthe small molecules in the filtrate, needed by the body,are reabsorbed and returned to the bloodstream.
This reabsorption step is defective in Fanconi’s syn-"
"This reabsorption step is defective in Fanconi’s syn-
drome. As a consequence, substances that are normallyreabsorbed, like glucose, amino acids, small proteins,water, calcium, potassium, magnesium, bicarbonate, andphosphate, are lost and the body becomes overly acidic.
Fanconi’s syndrome is also known as Fanconi syn-
drome, renal Fanconi syndrome, Fanconi renaltubularsyndrome, and Lignac-de Toni-Debré-Fanconi syndrome.Fanconi’s anemia is, however, a totally different disease.
Causes and symptoms
Causes
Fanconi’s syndrome can be caused by a variety of
genetic defects and by certain environmental assaults.
The genetic diseases known to give rise to Fan-
coni’s syndrome are cystinosis (the most common causein children), galactosemia , glycogen storage disease,
hereditary fructose intolerance , Lowe syndrome,
Wilson disease , tyrosinemia, medullary cystic disease,
vitamin D dependency, and familial idiopathic Fan-coni’s syndrome.
Environmental assaults that cause Fanconi’s syn-"
"Environmental assaults that cause Fanconi’s syn-
drome include exposure to heavy metals (like cadmium,lead, mercury, platinum, uranium), certain drugs (likeoutdated tetracycline and gentamicin), other substances(like Lysol, paraquat, toluene, the amino acid lysinetaken as a nutritional supplement), and kidney trans-
plantation .
Symptoms
Fanconi’s syndrome symptoms related directly to
impaired absorption include excessive urine productionand urination; excessive thirst; dehydration ; constipa-
tion; anorexia nervosa ; vomiting; elevated levels of glu-
cose, phosphate, calcium, uric acid, amino acids, andprotein (especially beta
2-microglobulin and lysozyme) in
the urine; elevated levels of chloride and decreased levelsof phosphate and calcium in the blood; and excessivelyacidic blood.
The most noticeable indirect consequences of"
"The most noticeable indirect consequences of
impaired reabsorption are the bone diseases, rickets andosteomalacia. Rickets affects children and is associatedwith bone deformities, failure to grow, and difficultywalking. If a person acquires Fanconi’s syndrome as anadult, the bone disease is termed osteomalacia and isaccompanied by severe bone pain and spontaneous frac-
tures . Unlike rickets due to malnutrition , these diseases
cannot be reversed with vitamin D. Muscle weakness andoccasional paralysis are other indirect consequences of
the ineffective reabsorption.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Fanconi’s syndrome can be made by
urine and blood tests. It is also important to find theunderlying cause to decide on the best treatment. Othersymptoms specific to a particular patient will point toother useful diagnostic tests. For example, high levels of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1290Fanconi’s syndrome"
"blood galactose in conjunction with symptoms of Fan-
coni’s syndrome indicate the patient is suffering fromgalactosemia, while high blood levels of cadmium indi-cate the patient is suffering from cadmium poisoning .
Treatment
Fanconi’s syndrome is best treated by attacking the
underlying cause whenever possible. For example, whencystinosis is treated with the drug cysteamine to lowercystine levels in the body or Wilson disease is treatedwith penicillamine to lower the levels of copper, accom-panying symptoms of Fanconi’s syndrome will subside.If the patient has acquired the disease from a heavy metalor another toxic agent, all contact with the toxic agentshould stop; the condition will then likely disappear.
Nevertheless, additional treatment will be necessary
either when it’s not possible to treat the underlying causeor while waiting for the kidneys to resume normal func-tion. This is done by restricting sodium chloride (tablesalt), giving antacids to counteract the excessive acidity"
"of the blood, and supplying potassium supplements.
Kidney transplant is the treatment of last resort, used
for patients whose kidneys have failed.
Prognosis
Fanconi’s syndrome can be reversible. Fanconi’s
syndrome caused by kidney transplantation usuallyreverses itself within the first year after transplantsurgery. When caused by a toxin in the environment,Fanconi’s syndrome generally can be reversed by remov-ing the causative agent from the patient’s environment. Ifit is caused by a genetic disease, it can usually bereversed by treating the disease. However, if Fanconi’ssyndrome is not treated or if treatment is unsuccessful,the kidneys can fail.
Prevention
Fanconi’s syndrome caused secondarily by the
genetic diseases galactosemia, glycogen storage disease,hereditary fructose intolerance, and tyrosinemia is pre-vented by appropriate dietary restrictions to treat thegenetic disease, starting in infancy.

Fasciotomy
Definition
Fasciotomy is a surgical procedure that cuts away
the fascia to relieve tension or pressure
Purpose
The fascia is thin connective tissue covering, or sep-
arating, the muscles and internal organs of the body. Itvaries in thickness, density, elasticity, and composition,and is different from ligaments and tendons.
The fascia can be injured either through constant
strain or through trauma. Fasciitis is an inflammation ofthe fascia. The most common condition for which fas-ciotomy is performed is plantar fasciitis, an inflamma-tion of the fascia on the bottom of the foot that is some-times called a heel spur or stone bruise.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1291Fasciotomy"
"Plantar fasciitis is caused by long periods on the
feet, being overweight, and wearing shoes that do notsupport the foot well. Teachers, mail carriers, runners,and others who make heavy use of their feet are especial-ly likely to suffer from plantar fasciitis.
Plantar fasciitis results in moderate to disabling heel
pain . If nine to twelve months of conservative treatment
(reducing time on feet, non-steroid anti-inflammatorydrugs, arch supports) under the supervision of a doctordoes not result in pain relief, a fasciotomy may be done.Fasciotomy removes a small portion of the fascia torelieve tension and pain. Connective tissue grows backinto the cut space left by the cut, effectively lengtheningthe fascia.
When a fasciotomy is performed on other parts of"
"When a fasciotomy is performed on other parts of
the body, it is usually done to relieve pressure from acompression injury to a limb. This type of injury oftenoccurs during contact sports. The blood vessels of thelimb are damaged. They swell and leak, causinginflammation. Fluid builds up in the area contained bythe fascia. A fasciotomy is done to relieve this pres-sure and prevent tissue death . Similar injury occurs in
high voltage electrical burns where deep tissue dam-
age occurs.
Precautions
In the case of injury, fasciotomy is done on an emer-
gency basis, and the outcome of the surgery dependslargely on the general health of the patient. Plantar fas-ciotomies are appropriate for most people whose footproblems cannot be resolved in any other way.
Description
Fasciotomy in the limbs is usually done by a surgeon
under general or regional anesthesia. An incision is madein the skin, and a small area of fascia is removed where itwill best relieve pressure. Then the incision is closed."
"Plantar fasciotomy is an endoscopic (performed with
the use of an endoscope) procedure. It is done by a footspecialist in a doctor’s office or outpatient surgical clinicunder local anesthesia and takes 20 minutes to one hour.The doctor makes two small incisions on either side ofthe heel. An endoscope is inserted in one to guide thedoctor in where to cut. A tiny knife is inserted in theother. A portion of the fascia is cut from near the heel;then the incisions are closed.
Preparation
Little preparation is done before a fasciotomy. When
the fasciotomy is related to burn injuries, the fluid andelectrolyte status of the patient are constantly monitored.KEY TERMS
Endoscope —A tube that contains a tiny camera and
light, that is inserted in the body to allow a doctorto see inside without making a large incision.
Aftercare
Aftercare depends on the reason for the fasciotomy."
"Aftercare
Aftercare depends on the reason for the fasciotomy.
People who have endoscopic plantar fasciotomy canwalk without pain almost immediately, return to wearingtheir regular shoes within three to five days, and return tonormal activities within three weeks. Most will need towear arch supports in their shoes.
Risks
In endoscopic plantar fasciotomy, the greatest risk is
that the arch will drop slightly as a result of this surgery,causing other foot problems. Risks involved with othertypes of fasciotomy are those associated with the admin-istration of anesthesia and the development of blood clots.
Normal results
Fasciotomy in the limbs reduces pressure, thus
reducing tissue death. Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy hasa success rate of 90–95%.

Fasting is voluntarily not eating food for varying
lengths of time. Fasting is used as a medical therapy formany conditions. It is also a spiritual practice in manyreligions.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1292Fasting"
"Purpose
Fasting can be used for nearly every chronic condi-
tion, including allergies ,anxiety , arthritis, asthma ,
depression, diabetes, headaches, heart disease, high cho-
lesterol , low blood sugar, digestive disorders, mental ill-
ness, and obesity . Fasting is an effective and safe weight
loss method. It is frequently prescribed as a detoxifica-
tion treatment for those with conditions that may be
influenced by environmental factors, such as cancer and
multiple chemical sensitivity . Fasting has been used
successfully to help treat people who have been exposedto high levels of toxic materials due to accident or occu-pation. Fasting is thought to be beneficial as a preventa-tive measure to increase overall health, vitality, and resis-tance to disease. Fasting is also used as a method of men-tal and spiritual rejuvenation.

"Description
Origins
Used for thousands of years, fasting is one of the
oldest therapies in medicine. Many of the great doctorsof ancient times and many of the oldest healing systemshave recommended it as an integral method of healingand prevention. Hippocrates, the father of Western medi-cine, believed fasting enabled the body to heal itself.Paracelsus, another great healer in the Western tradition,wrote 500 years ago that “fasting is the greatest remedy,the physician within.” Ayurvedic medicine , the world’s
oldest healing system, has long advocated fasting as amajor treatment.
Fasting has also been used in nearly every religion in
the world, including Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism,and Islam. Many of history’s great spiritual leaders fastedfor mental and spiritual clarity, including Jesus, Buddha,and Mohammed. In one of the famous political acts ofthe last century, the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi fast-ed for 21 days to promote peace."
"Fasting has been used in Europe as a medical treat-
ment for years. Many spas and treatment centers, particu-larly those in Germany, Sweden, and Russia, use med-ically supervised fasting. Fasting has gained popularityin American alternative medicine over the past severaldecades, and many doctors feel it is beneficial. Fasting isa central therapy in detoxification, a healing methodfounded on the principle that the build up of toxic sub-stances in the body is responsible for many illnesses andconditions.
The principle of fasting is simple. When the intake
of food is temporarily stopped, many systems of thebody are given a break from the hard work of digestion.The extra energy gives the body the chance to heal andrestore itself, and burning stored calories gets rid of toxic
substances stored in the body.

The digestive tract is the part of the body most

When food is broken down inthe intestines, it travels through the blood to the liver, thelargest organ of the body’s natural detoxification system.The liver breaks down and removes the toxic by-productsproduced by digestion, including natural ones and thechemicals now present in the food supply. During fast-ing, the liver and immune system are essentially freed todetoxify and heal other parts of the body.
Many healers claim that fasting is a particularly use-
ful therapy for Americans and for the modern lifestyle,subjected to heavy diets , overeating, and constant expo-"
"sure to food additives and chemicals. Some alternativepractitioners have gone so far as to estimate that the aver-age American is carrying 5-10 pounds of toxic sub-stances in their bodies, for which fasting is the quickestand most effective means of removal.
Physiology of fasting
Through evolution, the body became very efficient
at storing energy and handling situations when no foodwas available. For many centuries, fasting was probablya normal occurrence for most people, and the bodyadapted to it. It is estimated that even very thin peoplecan survive for 40 days or more without food. The bodyhas a special mechanism that is initiated when no food iseaten. Fasting is not starvation , but rather the body’s
burning of stored energy. Starvation occurs when thebody no longer has any stored energy and begins usingessential tissues such as organs for an energy source.Therapeutic fasts are stopped long before this happens.
Many physiological changes occur in the body dur-"
"Many physiological changes occur in the body dur-
ing fasting. During the first day or so, the body uses itsglycogen reserves, the sugars that are the basic energysupply. After these are depleted, the body begins usingfat. However, the brain, which has high fuel require-ments, still needs glucose (sugars converted from glyco-gen). To obtain glucose for the brain, the body begins tobreak down muscle tissue during the second day of thefast. Thus, during fasting some muscle loss will occur. Tofuel the brain, the body would need to burn over a poundof muscle a day, but the body has developed another wayto create energy that saves important muscle mass. Thisprotein-sparing process is called ketosis, which occursduring the third day of a fast for men and the second dayfor women. In this highly efficient state, the liver beginsconverting stored fat and other nonessential tissues intoketones, which can be used by the brain, muscles, and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1293Fasting"
"heart as energy. It is at this point in the fast that sensa-
tions of hunger generally go away, and many peopleexperience normal or even increased energy levels. Hor-mone levels and certain functions become more stable inthis state as well. The goal of most fasts is to allow thebody to reach the ketosis state in order to burn excess fatand unneeded or damaged tissue. Thus, fasts longer thanthree days are generally recommended as therapy.
Weight loss occurs most rapidly during the first few
days of a fast, up to 2 pounds per day. In following days,the figure drops to around 0.5 pound per day. An averageweight loss of a pound a day for an entire fast can beexpected.
Performing a fast

"Performing a fast
Fasts can be performed for varying lengths of time,
depending on the person and his or her health require-ments. For chronic conditions, therapists recommendfrom two to four weeks to get the most benefits. Seven-day fasts are also commonly performed. A popular fast-ing program for prevention and general health is a three-day fast taken four times per year, at the change of eachseason. These can be easily performed over long week-ends. Preventative fasts of one day per week are used bymany people as well.

"Juice fasts are also used by many people, although
these are not technically fasts. Juice fasts are less inten-sive than water fasts because the body doesn’t reach theketosis stage. The advantage of juice fasts is that fruit andvegetable drinks can supply extra energy and nutrients.People can fit a few days of juice fasting into their normalschedules without significant drops in energy. Juice fastsare also said to have cleansing and detoxifying effects.The disadvantage of juice fasts is that the body never getsto the ketosis stage, so these fasters are thought to lack thedeep detoxification and healing effects of the water fast.
Medical supervision is recommended for any fast"
"Medical supervision is recommended for any fast
over three days. Most alternative medicine practitioners,such as homeopaths, naturopathic doctors, and ayurvedicdoctors, can supervise and monitor patients during fasts.Those performing extended fasts and those with healthconditions may require blood, urine, and other tests dur-ing fasting. There are many alternative health clinics thatperform medically supervised fasts as well. Some con-ventional medical doctors may also supervise patientsduring fasts. Costs and insurance coverage vary, depend-ing on the doctor, clinic, and requirements of the patient.
Preparations
Fasts must be entered and exited with care. To enter
a fast, the diet should be gradually lightened over a fewdays. First, heavy foods such as meats and dairy products"
"should be eliminated for a day or two. Grains, nuts, andbeans should then be reduced for several days. The daybefore a fast, only easily digested foods like fruits, lightsalads, and soups should be eaten. During the fast, onlypure water and occasional herbal teas should be drunk.
Fasts should be ended as gradually as they are
entered, going from lighter to heavier foods progressive-ly. The diet after a fast should emphasize fresh, whole-some foods. Fasters should particularly take care not toovereat when they complete a fast.
Precautions
Fasting isn’t appropriate for everyone and, in some
cases, could be harmful. Any person undertaking a firstfast longer than three days should seek medical supervi-sion. Those with health conditions should always havemedical support during fasting. Plenty of water should betaken by fasters since dehydration can occur. Saunas and"
"sweating therapies are sometimes recommended to assistdetoxification, but should be used sparingly. Those fastingshould significantly slow down their lifestyles. Takingtime off of work is helpful, or at least reducing the workload. Fasters should also get plenty of rest. Exercise
should be kept light, such as walking and gentle stretching.
Side effects
Those fasting may experience side effects of
fatigue , malaise, aches and pains, emotional duress,
acne , headaches, allergies, swelling, vomiting, bad
breath , and symptoms of colds and flu. These reactions
are sometimes called healing crises , which are caused by
temporarily increased levels of toxins in the body due toelimination and cleansing. Lower energy levels should beexpected during a fast.

"Research and general acceptance
The physiology of fasting has been widely studied
and documented by medical science. Beneficial effectssuch as lowered cholesterol and improved general func-tioning have been shown. Fasting as a treatment for ill-ness and disease has been studied less, although somestudies around the world have shown beneficial results. A1984 study showed that workers in Taiwan who hadsevere chemical poisoning had dramatic improvement
after a ten-day fast. In Russia and Japan, studies havedemonstrated fasting to be an effective treatment for men-tal illness. Fasting has been featured on the cover of med-ical journals, although mainstream medicine has general-ly ignored fasting and detoxification treatments as validmedical procedures.

Physically, fatigue is characterized by a profound
lack of energy, feelings of muscle weakness, and slowedmovements or central nervous system reactions. Fatiguecan also trigger serious mental exhaustion. Persistentfatigue can cause a lack of mental clarity (or feeling ofmental “fuzziness”), difficulty concentrating, and insome cases, memory loss.

"Causes and symptoms
Fatigue may be the result of one or more environ-
mental causes such as inadequate rest, improper diet,work and home stressors, or poor physical conditioning,or one symptom of a chronic medical condition or dis-ease process in the body. Heart disease, low blood pres-sure, diabetes, end-stage renal disease, iron-deficiencyanemia, narcolepsy , and cancer can cause long-term,
ongoing fatigue symptoms. Acute illnesses such as viraland bacterial infections can also trigger temporary feel-ings of exhaustion. In addition, mental disorders such asdepression can also cause fatigue.
A number of medications, including antihistamines ,
antibiotics , and blood pressure medications, may cause
drowsiness as a side-effect. Individuals already sufferingfrom fatigue who are prescribed one of these medicationsmay wish to check with their healthcare provider aboutalternative treatments.

Because fatigue is a symptom of a number of differ-
ent disorders, diseases, and lifestyle choices, diagnosismay be difficult. A thorough examination and patient his-tory by a qualified healthcare provider is the first step indetermining the cause of the fatigue. A physician canrule out physical conditions and diseases that featurefatigue as a symptom, and can also determine if prescrip-tion drugs, poor dietary habits, work environment, orother external stressors could be triggering the exhaus-tion. Several diagnostic tests may also be required to rule

Diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome is signifi-
cantly more difficult. Because there is no specific biolog-ical marker or conclusive blood test to check for the dis-order, healthcare providers must rely on the patient’s pre-sentation and severity of symptoms to make a diagnosis.In many cases, individuals with chronic fatigue syn-drome go through a battery of invasive diagnostic testsand several years of consultation with medical profes-sionals before receiving a correct diagnosis.

"Treatment
Conventional medicine recommends the dietary and
lifestyle changes outlined above as a first line of defenseagainst fatigue. Individuals who experience occasionalfatigue symptoms may benefit from short term use ofcaffeine-containing central nervous stimulants, whichmake people more alert, less drowsy, and improve coor-dination. However, these should be prescribed withextreme caution, as overuse of the drug can lead to seri-ous sleep disorders , like insomnia .
Another reason to avoid extended use of caffeine is
its associated withdrawal symptoms. People who uselarge amounts of caffeine over long periods build up atolerance to it. When that happens, they have to use moreand more caffeine to get the same effects. Heavy caffeineuse can also lead to dependence. If an individual stopsusing caffeine abruptly, withdrawal symptoms mayoccur, including headache , fatigue, drowsiness, yawn-"
"ing, irritability, restlessness, vomiting, or runny nose.These symptoms can go on for as long as a week.
Alternative treatment
The treatment of fatigue depends on its direct cause,
but there are several commonly prescribed treatments fornon-specific fatigue, including dietary and lifestylechanges, the use of essential oils and herbal therapies,deep breathing exercises, traditional Chinese medicine ,
and color therapy.
Dietary changes
Inadequate or inappropriate nutritional intake can
cause fatigue symptoms. To maintain an adequate energysupply and promote overall physical well-being, individ-uals should eat a balanced diet and observe the followingnutritional guidelines:
• Drink plenty of water. Individuals should try to drink 9
to 12 glasses of water a day. Dehydration can reduce
blood volume, which leads to feelings of fatigue.• Eat iron-rich foods (i.e., liver, raisins, spinach, apri-"
"cots). Iron enables the blood to transport oxygenthroughout the tissues, organs, and muscles, and dimin-ished oxygenation of the blood can result in fatigue.
• Avoid high-fat meals and snacks. High fat foods take
longer to digest, reducing blood flow to the brain, heart,and rest of the body while blood flow is increased to thestomach.
• Eat unrefined carbohydrates and proteins together for
sustained energy.
• Balance proteins. Limiting protein to 15–20 grams per
meal and two snacks of 15 grams is recommended, butnot getting enough protein adds to fatigue. Pregnant orbreastfeeding women should get more protein.
• Get the recommended daily allowance of B complex
vitamins (specifically, pantothenic acid, folic acid , thi-
amine, and vitamin B
12). Deficiencies in these vitamins
can trigger fatigue.
• Get the recommended daily allowance of selenium,
riboflavin, and niacin. These are all essential nutritionalelements in metabolizing food energy."
"riboflavin, and niacin. These are all essential nutritionalelements in metabolizing food energy.
• Control portions. Individuals should only eat when
they’re hungry, and stop when they’re full. An over-stuffed stomach can cause short-term fatigue, and indi-viduals who are overweight are much more likely toregularly experience fatigue symptoms.
Lifestyle changes
Lifestyle factors such as a high-stress job, erratic work
hours, lack of social or family support, or erratic sleep pat-terns can all cause prolonged fatigue. If stress is an issue, anumber of relaxation therapies and techniques are availableto help alleviate tension, including massage, yoga ,aro-
matherapy ,hydrotherapy , progressive relaxation exercis-
es,meditation , and guided imagery . Some individuals
may also benefit from individual or family counseling orpsychotherapy sessions to work through stress-relatedfatigue that is a result of family or social issues.

"Maintaining healthy sleep patterns is critical to prop-
er rest. Having a set “bedtime” helps to keep sleep onschedule. A calm and restful sleeping environment is alsoimportant to healthy sleep. Above all, the bedroom shouldbe quiet and comfortable, away from loud noises and withadequate window treatments to keep sunlight and street-lights out. Removing distractions from the bedroom suchas televisions and telephones can also be helpful.
Essential oils
Aromatherapists, hydrotherapists, and other holistic
healthcare providers may recommend the use of essential

blue gum ( Eucalyptus globulus ), peppermint, ( Mentha x

the nervous system and reduce fatigue. These oils can beadded to bathwater or massage oil as a topical applica-tion. Citrus oils such as lemon, orange, grapefruit, andlime have a similar effect, and can be added to a steambath or vaporizer for inhalation.
Herbal remedies
Herbal remedies that act as circulatory stimulants
can offset the symptoms of fatigue in some individuals.An herbalist may recommend an infusion of ginger ( Zin-
giber officinale ) root or treatment with cayenne ( Cap-

However, long-term use of caffeine can causerestlessness, irritability, and other unwanted side effects,and in some cases may actually work to increase fatigueafter the stimulating effects of the caffeine wear off. Toavoid these problems, caffeine intake should be limitedto 300 mg or less a day (the equivalent of 4-8 cups ofbrewed, hot tea).
Traditional Chinese medicine
Chinese medicine regards fatigue as a blockage or
misalignment of qi, or energy flow, inside the human
body. The practitioner of Chinese medicine choosesacupuncture and/or herbal therapy to rebalance the
entire system. The Chinese formula Minot Bupleurumsoup (or Xiao Chia Hu Tang) has been used for nearly2,000 years for the type of chronic fatigue that comesafter the flu. In this condition, the person has low-gradefever , nausea, and fatigue. There are other formulas that"
"are helpful in other cases. Acupuncture involves theplacement of a series of thin needles into the skin at tar-geted locations on the body known as acupoints in orderto harmonize the energy flow within the human body.KEY TERMS

Deep breathing exercises
Individuals under stress often experience fast, shal-

"Deep breathing exercises are best performed while
laying flat on the back on a hard surface, usually the floor.The knees are bent, and the body (particularly the mouth,nose, and face) is relaxed. One hand should be placed onthe chest and one on the abdomen to monitor breathingtechnique. With proper breathing techniques, the abdomenwill rise further than the chest. The individual takes a seriesof long, deep breaths through the nose, attempting to raisethe abdomen instead of the chest. Air is exhaled throughthe relaxed mouth. Deep breathing can be continued for upto 20 minutes. After the exercise is complete, the individual

Fatty liver is the collection of excessive amounts of
triglycerides and other fats inside liver cells.
Description
Also called steatosis, fatty liver can be a temporary or
long-term condition, which is not harmful itself, but mayindicate some other type of problem. Left untreated, it cancontribute to other illnesses. It is usually reversible oncethe cause of the problem is diagnosed and corrected. Theliver is the organ responsible for changing fats eaten inthe diet to types of fat that can be stored and used by thebody.

"holism ,malnutrition ,pregnancy , or poisoning . In fatty
liver, large droplets of fat, containing mostly triglycerides,collect within cells of the liver. The condition is generallynot painful and may go unnoticed for a long period oftime. In severe cases, the liver can increase to over threetimes its normal size and may be painful and tender.
Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of fatty liver in the United
States is alcoholism. In alcoholic fatty liver, over con-sumption of alcohol changes the way that the liver breaksdown and stores fats. Often, people with chronic alco-holism also suffer from malnutrition by eating irregularlyand not consuming a balanced diet. Conditions that canalso cause fatty liver are other forms of malnutrition(especially when there is not enough protein in the diet),obesity ,diabetes mellitus , and Reye’s syndrome in"
"children. Pregnancy can cause a rare, but serious form offatty liver that starts late in pregnancy and may be associ-ated with jaundice and liver failure. Some drug overdos-
es or toxic chemical poisonings, such as carbon tetra-chloride, can also cause fatty liver.
Often, there are no symptoms associated with fatty
liver. If there are symptoms, they can include pain under
the rib cage on the right side of the body, swelling of the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1298Fatty liver"
"abdomen, jaundice, and fever . Symptoms that occur less
often in alcoholic fatty liver, but more often in pregnancyrelated fatty liver, are nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite,and abdominal pain.
Diagnosis
During a physical examination , a doctor might notice
that the liver is enlarged and tender when the abdomen ispalpated (examined with the tips of the fingers while thepatient lies flat). Blood tests may be used to determine ifthe liver is functioning properly. A liver biopsy , where a"
"small sample of liver tissue is removed with a long needleor though a very small incision, can be used to confirmfatty liver. In pregnant women, the fatty liver condition isusually associated with another serious complication, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. In this condition, the mother hasseriously high blood pressure, swelling, and possibly,seizures. Laboratory abnormalities include elevations ofthe SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase) andSGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase). In manycases the alkaline phosphatase will be significantly elevat-ed due to cholestasis produced by the fatty infiltration.

Vitamin and mineral supplements alongwith nutritional support may be useful.
Prognosis
Fatty liver is usually reversible if recognized and
treated. There may be some long-term tendency towardother types of liver problems depending on how long andhow severe the fatty liver condition was. In pregnantwomen with the condition, the situation can be lifethreatening for both the mother and the infant. Leftuntreated, there is a high risk of death for both the moth-

"people fecal incontinence is a relatively minor problem,
as when it is limited to a slight occasional soiling ofunderwear, but for other people it involves a considerableloss of bowel control and has a devastating effect onquality of life and psychological well-being. Fortunately,professional medical treatment is usually able to restorebowel control or at least substantially reduce the severityof the condition.
Description
Fecal incontinence, also called bowel incontinence,
can occur at any age, but is most common among peopleover the age of 65, who sometimes have to cope withurinary incontinence as well. It was reported in 1998"
"that about 2% of adults experience fecal incontinence atleast once a week whereas for healthy independent adultsover the age of 65 the figure is about 7%. An extensiveAmerican survey, published in 1993, found fecal soilingin 7.1% of the surveyed population, with gross inconti-nence in 0.7%. For men and women the incidence ofsoiling was the same, but women were almost twice aslikely to suffer from gross incontinence.
The wider public health impact of fecal incontinence"
"The wider public health impact of fecal incontinence
is considerable. In the United States, more than $400million is spent each year on disposable underwear andother incontinence aids. Fecal incontinence is the secondmost common reason for seeking a nursing home place-ment. One-third of the institutionalized elderly sufferfrom this condition. Incontinence sufferers, however,often hesitate to ask their doctors for help because theyare embarrassed or ashamed. The 1993 American surveydiscovered that only one-sixth of those experiencing soil-ing had sought medical advice, and only one-half ofthose afflicted with gross incontinence.
Causes and symptoms
Fecal incontinence can result from a wide variety of
medical conditions, including childbirth-related analinjuries, other causes of damage to the anus or rectum,and nervous system problems.
Vaginal-delivery childbirth is a major cause of fecal"
"Vaginal-delivery childbirth is a major cause of fecal
incontinence. In many cases, childbirth results in damageto the anal sphincter, which is the ring of muscle thatcloses the anus and keeps stools within the rectum until aperson can find an appropriate opportunity to defecate.Nerve injuries during childbirth may also be a factor insome cases. An ultrasound study of first-time mothersfound sphincter injuries in 35%. About one-third of theinjured women developed fecal incontinence or anuncontrollable and powerful urge to defecate (urgency)within six weeks of giving birth. Childbirth-relatedincontinence is usually restricted to gas, but for some
women involves the passing of liquid or solid stools.
The removal of hemorrhoids by surgery or other
techniques (hemorrhoidectomies) can also cause analdamage and fecal incontinence, as can more complexoperations affecting the anus and surrounding areas. Analand rectal infections as well as Crohn’s disease can lead"
"to incontinence by damaging the muscles that controldefecation. For some people, incontinence becomes aproblem when the anal muscles begin to weaken inmidlife or old age.
Dementia ,mental retardation , strokes, brain tumors,
multiple sclerosis , and other conditions that affect the ner-
vous system can cause fecal incontinence by interferingwith muscle function or the normal rectal sensations that
trigger sphincter c ontraction and are necessary for
bowel control. One study of multiple sclerosis patientsdiscovered that about half were incontinent. Nervedamage caused by long-lasting diabetes mellitus (dia-
betic neuropathy ) is another condition that can give
rise to incontinence.
Diagnosis
Medical assessments in cases of fecal incontinence
typically involve three steps: asking questions about thepatient’s past and current health (the medical history); aphysical examination of the anal region; and testing for
objective information regarding anal and rectal function.

The doctorasks, for instance, how long the patient has been suf-fering from incontinence; how often and under whatcircumstances incontinence occurs; whether the patienthas any control over defecation; and whether thepatient has obstacles to defecation in his or her every-day surroundings, such as a toilet that can be reachedonly by climbing a long flight of stairs. For womenwho have given birth, a detailed obstetric history isalso necessary.

"Physical examination
The physical examination begins with a visual
inspection of the anus and the area lying between theanus and the genitals (the perineum) for hemorrhoids,infections, and other conditions that might explain thepatient’s difficulties.

means that the patient’s rectum has been weakened anddrops down through the anus. Next, the doctor uses a pinor probe to stroke the perianal skin. Normally this touch-
ing causes the anal sphincter to contract and the anus topucker; if it does not, nerve damage may be present. Thefinal phase of the examination requires the doctor toexamine internal structures by carefully inserting agloved and lubricated finger into the anal canal. Thisallows the doctor to judge the strength of the anal sphinc-ter and a key muscle (the puborectalis muscle) in main-taining continence; to look for abnormalities such asscars and rectal masses; and to learn many other thingsabout the patient’s medical situation. At this point thedoctor performs the anal wink test again and asks thepatient to squeeze and bear down.

"Laboratory tests
Information from the medical history and physical
examination usually needs to be supplemented by teststhat provide objective measurements of anal and rectalfunction. Anorectal manometry, a common procedure,involves inserting a small tube (catheter) or balloondevice into the anal canal or rectum. Manometry mea-sures, among other things, pressure levels in the analcanal, rectal sensation, and anal and rectal reflexes. Testsare also available for assessing nerve damage. An analultrasound probe can supply accurate images of the analsphincter and reveal whether injury has occurred. Mag-
netic resonance imaging , which requires the insertion of
a coil into the anal canal, is useful at times.

"Treatment
Fecal incontinence arising from an underlying con-
dition such as diabetic neuropathy can sometimes behelped by treating the underlying condition. When thatdoes not work, or no underlying condition can be discov-ered, one approach is to have the patient use a supposito-ry or enema to stimulate defecation at the same timeevery day or every other day. The goal is to restore regu-lar bowel habits and keep the bowels free of stools. Med-ications such as loperamide (Imodium) and codeinephosphate are often effective in halting incontinence, butonly in less severe cases involving liquid stools orurgency. Dietary changes and exercises done at home tostrengthen the anal muscles may also help.

Fecal incontinence is a problem that usually
responds well to professional medical treatment, evenamong elderly and institutionalized patients. If com-plete bowel control cannot be restored, the impact ofincontinence on everyday life can still be lessened con-siderably in most cases. When incontinence remains aproblem despite medical treatment, disposable under-wear and other commercial incontinence products areavailable to make life easier.

"Fecal occult blood test
Definition
The fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is performed as
part of the routine physical examination during theexamination of the rectum. It is used to detect micro-
scopic blood in the stool and is a screening tool for col-orectal cancer .
Purpose
FOBT uses chemical indicators on stool samples to
detect the presence of blood not otherwise visible. (Theword “occult” in the test’s name means that the blood ishidden from view.) Blood originating from or passingthrough the gastrointestinal tract can signal many condi-tions requiring further diagnostic procedures and, possi-bly, medical intervention. These conditions may bebenign or malignant and some of them include:
• colorectal and gastric cancers
• ulcers
• hemorrhoids
• polyps
• inflammatory bowel disease
• irritations or lesions of the gastrointestinal tract caused
by medications (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-
tory drugs , also called NSAIDs)"
"by medications (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-
tory drugs , also called NSAIDs)
• irritations or lesions of the gastrointestinal tract caused
by stomach acid disorders, such as reflux esophagitis
The FOBT is used routinely (in conjunction with a
rectal examination performed by a physician) to screen
for colorectal cancer, particularly after age 50. The order-ing of this test should not be taken as an indication thatcancer is suspected. The FOBT must be combined withregular screening endoscopy (such as a sigmoidoscopy )
to detect cancers at an early stage.
Precautions
Certain foods and medicines can influence the test
results. Some fruits contain chemicals that prevent theguaiac, the chemical in which the test paper is soaked,from reacting with the blood. Aspirin and some NSAIDs"
"irritate the stomach, resulting in bleeding and should beavoided prior to the examination, along with red meatand many vegetables and fruits containing vitamin C. Allof these factors could result in a false-positive test.
Description
Feces for the stool samples is obtained either by the
physician at the rectal examination or by the patient athome, using a small spatula or a collection device. Inmost cases, the collection of stool samples can easily bedone at home, using a kit supplied by the physician. Thestandard kit contains a specially prepared card on which
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1302Fecal occult blood test"
"a small sample of stool will be spread, using a stick pro-
vided in the kit. The sample is placed in a special enve-lope and either mailed or brought in for analysis. Whenthe physician applies hydrogen peroxide to the back ofthe sample, the paper will turn blue if an abnormalamount of blood is present.
Types of fecal occult blood tests
Hemoccult is one type of fecal occult blood test, and
it is the most commonly used. The Hemoccult test takesless than five minutes to perform and may be performedin the physician’s office or in the laboratory. The Hemoc-cult blood test can detect bleeding from the colon as lowas 0.5 mg per day.
Tests that use anti-hemoglobin antibodies (or
immunochemical tests) to detect blood in the stool arealso used. Immunochemical tests can detect up to 0.7 mgof hemoglobin in the stool and do not require dietaryrestrictions. Immunochemical tests

• are more sensitive than Hemoccult tests in detecting"
"• are more sensitive than Hemoccult tests in detecting
colorectal cancer
• are more expensive than Hemoccult tests
Hemoquant, another fecal occult blood test, is used
to detect as much as 500 mg/g of blood in the stool. Likethe Hemoccult, the Hemoquant test is affected by redmeat. It is not affected by chemicals in vegetables.
Fecal blood may also be measured by measuring the
chromium in the red blood cells in the feces. The stool iscollected for three to ten days. The test is used in caseswhere the exact amount of the blood loss is required andit is the only test that can exclude blood loss from thegastrointestines with accuracy.
Preparation
For 72 hours prior to collecting samples, patients
should avoid red meats, NSAIDs (including aspirin),antacids , steroids, iron supplements, and vitamin C,"
"including citrus fruits and other foods containing largeamounts of vitamin C. Foods like uncooked broccoli,uncooked turnips, cauliflower, uncooked cantaloupe,uncooked radish and horseradish and parsnips should beavoided and not eaten during the 72 hours prior to theexamination. Fish, chicken, pork, fruits (other than mel-ons) and many cooked vegetables are permitted in the diet.
Results
Many factors can result in false-positive and false-
negative findings.KEY TERMS

"Positive results
It is important to note that a true-positive finding
only signifies the presence of blood—it is not an indica-tion of cancer. The National Cancer Institute states that,in its experience, less than 10% of all positive resultswere caused by cancer. The FOBT is positive in 1–5% ofthe unscreened population and 2–10% of those are foundto have cancer. The physician will want to follow up on apositive result with further tests, as indicated by otherfactors in the patient’s history or condition.
Negative results
Alternatively, a negative result (meaning no blood
was detected) does not guarantee the absence of colon
cancer , which may bleed only occasionally or not at all.

"Conclusions
Screening using the FOBT has been demonstrated to
reduce colorectal cancer. However, because only half ofcolorectal cancers are FOBT-positive, FOBT must becombined with regular screening endoscopy to increasethe detection of pre-malignant colorectal polyps and can-cers. Since, through FOBT, cancer may be detected early,the benefits of possible early detection must be consid-ered along with the likelihood of complications and costsfor additional studies.

Feldenkrais method
Definition
The Feldenkrais method is an educational system
that allows the body to move and function more effi-ciently and comfortably. Its goal is to re-educate thenervous system and improve motor ability. The systemcan accomplish much more, relieving pressure on jointsand weak points, and allowing the body to heal repeti-tive strain injuries. Continued use of the method canrelieve pain and lead to higher standards of achieve-
ment in sports, the martial arts, dancing and other phys-ical disciplines.
Pupils are taught to become aware of their move-"
"Pupils are taught to become aware of their move-
ments and to become aware of how they use their bodies,thus discovering possible areas of stress and strain. The
goal of Feldenkrais is to take the individual from merelyfunctioning, to functioning well, free of pain and restric-tion of movement. Feldenkrais himself stated that hisgoal was, “To make the impossible possible, the possibleeasy, and the easy, elegant.”
Purpose
This method of re-educating the nervous system
can be beneficial to a wide range of people, includingathletes, children, the elderly, martial artists, those whoare handicapped, people with special needs, and thosesuffering from degenerative diseases. It has alsoproved popular with artists, particularly musicians, anumber of whom have used Feldenkrais to improvetheir performance.
The Feldenkrais Guild of North America (FGNA)"
"states that over half of the those who turn to Feldenkraispractitioners are seeking relief from pain. Many peoplewho have pain from an injury compensate by changingtheir movements to limit pain. Often these changedmovements remain after the pain from the originalinjury is gone, and new pain may occur. Feldenkraishelps students become aware of the changed movementsand allows them to learn new movements that relievetheir pain. Apart from the obvious physical benefits ofmore efficient movement and freedom from pain andrestriction, Feldenkrais practitioners assert that there areother positive benefits for overall physical and mentalhealth. Feldenkrais can result in increased awareness,flexibility, and coordination, and better relaxation.Feldenkrais practitioners have also noted other benefitsin their students, including improvements in awareness,flexibility, coordination, breathing, digestion, sleep,mood, mental alertness, energy, and range of motion, aswell as reduced stress and"
"digestion, sleep,mood, mental alertness, energy, and range of motion, aswell as reduced stress and hypertension , and fewer"
"headaches and backaches.
Musicians and athletes can improve their perfor-
mance in many ways when they learn to use their bodiesmore efficiently. Feldenkrais can also help injured ath-letes regain lost potential and free them from pain andrestriction of movement.
There are numerous accounts of the remarkable
results obtained when Feldenkrais is taught to handi-capped children so that they can learn to function despitetheir limitations. Handicapped people can learn to makefull use of whatever potential they have, and to havemore confidence in their abilities. Practitioners who spe-cialize in teaching Feldenkrais to those who have handi-caps have in many cases allowed the patient to discoverways of performing tasks which were previously thoughtto be impossible for them.
The elderly, whose movements are often restricted"
"The elderly, whose movements are often restricted
by pain and stiffness, can learn to overcome these obsta-cles with Feldenkrais instruction. In some instances evensevere cases of arthritis have been conquered. Theoreti-cally, Feldenkrais can make possible renewed levels ofenergy and freedom from restriction.
Description
Origins
Moshe Feldenkrais (1904–1984) was a Russian-
born Israeli physicist and engineer who was also anactive soccer player and judo master. He devised hissystem in response to his own recurring knee injury,which had restricted his movement and caused himgreat pain over a long period of time. Feldenkraisbelieved that repeated muscle patterns cause the partsof the brain controlling those muscles to stay in a fixedpattern as well. He thought that the more the musclesare used, the more parts of the brain can be activated.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1304Feldenkrais method"
"He devised a method of re-educating the neuromuscular
system and re-evaluating movement to increase effi-ciency and reduce stress, using his knowledge ofmechanics and engineering, and applying some of hismartial arts training.
Feldenkrais is described a being a dual system, with
two components: “Awareness Through Movement” and“Functional Integration.” The system aims to re-educatethe body so that habitual movements that cause strain orpain can be relearned to improve efficiency and eliminatedangerous or painful action.
Feldenkrais helps to translate intention into action.
In practice, an individual can learn to achieve his or herhighest potential, while at the same time learning toavoid and eliminate stresses, strains, and the possibilityof injury.
Functional integration
During this session, the patient wears comfortable"
"clothing, and may sit, stand, walk, or lie on a lowpadded table. The practitioner helps the pupil by guid-ing him or her through a number of movements. Thepractitioner may use touch to communicate with thestudent, but touch is not used to correct any move-ments. The purpose of this session is to increase a stu-dent’s awareness of his or her own movement andbecome open to different possibilities for movement.The instruction can be focused on a particular activitythat the student does every day, or that causes him orher pain. The student can learn to alter habitual move-ments and re-educate the neuromuscular system. Thistype of session is particularly useful for those whosuffer from limitations originating from misuse,stress, illness, or accident. It can also help athletes andmusicians perform to the best of their ability byincreasing their possibilities for movement. It offersstudents the potential for improving their physical andmental performance in addition to heightening thesense"
potential for improving their physical andmental performance in addition to heightening thesense of well-being.
"Awareness through movement
Feldenkrais’s martial arts background can be clear-
ly identified in many of the aspects of AwarenessThrough Movement (ATM). During group sessions,pupils are taught to become acutely aware of all theirmovements and to imagine them, so that they canimprove the efficiency of their actions in their minds,and put them into practice. Pupils are encouraged to bedisciplined about practicing their exercises, to achievemaximum benefit.
Awareness through movement is described as an
exploratory, nonjudgmental process through which pupilsMOSHE FELDENKRAIS
(1904–1984)
Moshe Feldenkrais was born on the border
between Russia and Poland. When he was only a boy of13, he traveled to Palestine on foot. The journey took ayear, and once there, young Feldenkrais worked as alaborer and cartographer, also tutoring others in mathe-matics. Moving to France in 1933, he graduated inmechanical and electrical engineering from the Ecoledes Travaux Publiques de Paris."
"Feldendrais became the first person to open a Judo
center in Paris after meeting with Jigaro Kano. He wasalso one of the first Europeans to become a black belt inJudo, in 1936.
Obtaining his Ph.D. at the Sorbonne, he went on to
assist Nobel Prize laureate, Frédéric Joliot-Curie at theCurie Institute. During World War II in England, heworked on the new sonar anti-submarine research.
Prompted by a recurring leg injury, he applied his
knowledge of the martial arts and his training as anengineer to devise a method of re-integrating the body.The concept was that more efficient movement wouldallow for the treatment of pain or disability, and the bet-ter-functioning of the body as a whole. Later on, hewould begin to teach what he had learned to others inTel Aviv.
In addition to many books about judo, including
Higher Judo , he wrote six books on his method.

Preparations
No preparation is necessary for the practice of
Feldenkrais, and all are encouraged to seek help fromthis system. No condition is considered a preclusion tothe benefits of Feldenkrais.
Precautions
As with any therapy or treatment, care should be
taken to choose a qualified practitioner. Feldenkrais prac-titioners stress that the body must not be forced to doanything, and if any movement is painful, or evenuncomfortable, it should be discontinued immediatelyand the patient should seek professional help.

"Side effects
No known side effects are associated with the prac-
tice of Feldenkrais.

Since Moshe Feldenkrais began to teach his method,
it has gradually gained acceptance as an education sys-tem. Published research using the method can be foundin United States and foreign publications.

Definition
Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the cutting, or

"Purpose
FGM results in the cutting or removal of the tissues
around the vagina that give women pleasurable sexualfeelings. This procedure is used for social and culturalcontrol of women’s sexuality. In its most extreme form,infibulation, where the girl’s vagina is sewn shut, the pro-cedure ensures virginity. In some cultures where femalecircumcision has been a tradition for hundreds of years,this procedure is considered a rite of passage for younggirls. Families fear that if their daughters are left uncir-cumcised, they may not be marriageable. As in most cul-tures, there is also the fear that the girl might bringshame to the family by being sexually active and becom-ing pregnant before marriage.

"Precautions
It is illegal to perform FGM in many countries,
including the United States, Canada, France, GreatBritain, Sweden, Switzerland, Egypt, Kenya, and Sene-gal. This procedure is usually done in the home or some-where other than a medical setting. Often, it is performedby a family member or by a local “circumciser,” usingknives, razor blades, or other tools that may not be steril-ized before use.

Female circumcision includes a wide range of pro-
cedures. The simplest form involves a small cut to theclitoris or labial tissue. A Sunna circumcision removesthe prepuce (a fold of skin that covers the clitoris) and/orthe tip of the clitoris. A clitoridectomy removes the entireclitoris and some or all of the surrounding tissue; thisprocedure occurs in approximately 80% of cases. Themost extreme form of genital mutilation is excision andinfibulation, in which the clitoris and all of the surroundtissue are cut away and the remaining skin is sewntogether. Only a small opening is left for the passage of

"urine and menstrual blood. Infibulation accounts for
approximately 15% of FGM procedures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates
that between 100 million and 140 million girls andwomen have undergone some form of FGM. As a verydeeply rooted cultural and religious tradition still prac-ticed in over 28 African and Asian countries, up to twomillion girls per year are at risk. The following countrieshave the highest number of occurrences of FGM: Dji-bouti (98%), Egypt (97%), Eritrea (95%), Guinea (99%),Mali (94%), Sierra Leone (90%), and Somalia (98-100%). As more people move to Western countries fromcountries where female circumcision is performed, thepractice has come to the attention of health professionalsin the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia.

"In an effort to integrate old customs with modern
medical care, some immigrant families have requestedthat physicians perform the procedure. While trying tobe sensitive to cultural traditions, health careproviders are sometimes put in the difficult position ofchoosing to perform this procedure in a medical facili-ty under sanitary conditions, or refusing the request,knowing that it may be done anyway with no medicalsupervision. Some families who are intent on havingthis procedure done will take their daughters back tothe country they immigrated from in order to have thegirls circumcised.
Many national and international medical organiza-
tions including the American Medical Association(AMA), Canadian medical organizations, and WHOoppose the practice of female genital mutilation. TheUnited Nations (UN) considers female genital mutilationa violation of human rights. WHO has undertaken a num-ber of projects aimed at decreasing the incidence ofFGM. These include the following activities:"
"• publishing a statement addressing the regional status of
FGM and encouraging the development of national pol-icy against its practice,
• organizing training for regional community workers,
• developing educational materials for local health care
workers,
• providing alternative occupations for individuals who
perform FGM procedures.

Female sexual arousal disorder
Definition
Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) occurs when
a woman is continually unable to attain or maintainarousal and lubrication during intercourse, is unable toreach orgasm, or has no desire for sexual intercourse.
Description
The disorder typically affects up to 25 percent of all
American women, or an estimated 47 million women.Three-fourths of women with FSAD are postmenopausal.Women describe it as being “unable to get turned on,” orbeing continually disinterested in sex. It is also called“frigidity.” Other terms for the disorder include dyspareu-nia and vaginismus, both of which involve pain during
intercourse.
Causes and symptoms"
"intercourse.
Causes and symptoms
There are numerous causes of this disorder. They
include:
• physical problems, such as endometriosis ,cystitis ,o r
vaginitis
• systemic problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure,
or hypothyroidism . Even pregnancy or the postpartum
period (time after delivery of a child) may affect desire.Menopause is also known to reduce sexual desire.
• medications, including oral contraceptives , anti-
depressants, antihypertensives, and tranquilizers
• surgery, such as mastectomy or hysterectomy which
may affect how a woman feels about her sexual self.
• stress
• depression
• use of alcohol, drugs, or cigarette smoking
Symptoms vary. A woman may have no desire for
sex, or may not be able to maintain arousal, or may beunable to reach orgasm. She may also have pain duringsex or orgasm, which interferes with her desire for inter-course.

"Diagnosis
To make a diagnosis, a woman’s physician - either
family doctor, gynecologist, or even urologist — takes acomplete medical history to determine when the problemstarted, how it presents, how severe it is, and what thepatient thinks may be causing it. The doctor will alsoconduct a complete physical examination , looking for
any abnormalities in the genital region
Treatment
The physician should start by providing education
about the disorder and recommending various non-med-ical treatment strategies. These include:
• use of erotic materials, such as vibrators, books, maga-
zines and videos
• sensual massage, avoiding the genitals
• position changes to reduce pain
• use of lubricants to moisten the vagina and genital area
• kegel exercises to strengthen the vagina and clitoris
• therapy to overcome any relationship or sexual abuse
issues
Medical treatments include:
• estrogen replacement therapy, which may help with
vaginal dryness, pain and arousal"
"• estrogen replacement therapy, which may help with
vaginal dryness, pain and arousal
• testosterone therapy in women who have low levels of
this male hormone (side effects, however, may includedeepening voice, hair growth, and acne)
• the EROS clitoral therapy device (EROS-CTD), recent-
ly approved by the Food and Drug Administration; asmall vacuum pump, placed over the clitoris and gentlyactivated to provide a gentle suction designed toincrease blood flow to the region, which, in turn, helpswith arousal
• using the herb yohimbine combined with nitric oxide
has been found to increase vaginal blood flow in post-menopausal women and thus help with some forms ofFSAD
Alternative treatment
Natural estrogens, such as those found in soy prod-
ucts and flax, may be effective. Herbal remedies includebelladonna, gingko, and motherwort. However, there isno scientific evidence to prove these herbs actually help.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1308Female sexual arousal disorder"
"Some women squirt vitamin E in their vagina to increase
lubrication.
Women may also want to see a sexual therapist for
additional help.
Prognosis
Generally, once women seek the appropriate help
they are quite likely to find a way to resolve their prob-lems. Often, a holistic approach, using physical as wellas emotional therapies, is required for success.
Prevention
Maintaining a close and open relationship with a
partner is one way to avoid the emotional pain and isola-tion that can lead to sexual dysfunction . Additionally,
women should learn if any medications they take affectsexual function, and should refrain from alcohol anddrugs and quit smoking. Women who have anxieties andfears about sexual intercourse, whether because of earlierabuse, rape, or a prudish upbringing, should deal withthose issues through therapy.

Fetal alcohol syndrome
Definition
Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a pattern of birth
defects , learning, and behavioral problems affecting
individuals whose mothers consumed alcohol duringpregnancy .
Description
FAS is the most common preventable cause of men-
tal retardation . This condition was first recognized and
reported in the medical literature in 1968 in France and in1973 in the United States. Alcohol is a teratogen, the termused for any drug, chemical, maternal disease or otherenvironmental exposure that can cause birth defects orfunctional impairment in a developing fetus. Some fea-tures may be present at birth including low birth weight,prematurity , and microcephaly. Characteristic facial fea-"
"tures may be present at birth, or may become more obvi-ous over time. Signs of brain damage include delays indevelopment, behavioral abnormalities, and mental retar-dation, but affected individuals exhibit a wide range ofabilities and disabilities. It has only been since 1991 thatthe long-term outcome of FAS has been known. Learning,behavioral, and emotional problems are common in ado-lescents and adults with FAS. Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE),a term no longer favored, is sometimes used to describeindividuals with some, but not all, of the features of FAS.In 1996, the Institute of Medicine suggested a five-levelsystem to describe the birth defects, learning and behav-ioral difficulties in offspring of women who drank alcoholduring pregnancy. This system contains criteria includingconfirmation of maternal alcohol exposure, characteristicfacial features, growth problems, learning and behavioralproblems, and birth defects known to be associated withprenatal alcohol exposure."
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1309Fetal alcohol syndrome
"The incidence of FAS varies among different popu-
lations studied, and ranges from approximately one in200 to one in 2000 at birth. However, a recent studyreported in 1997, utilizing the Institute of Medicine crite-ria, estimated the prevalence in Seattle, Washington from1975–1981 at nearly one in 100 live births. Avoidingalcohol during pregnancy, including the earliest weeks ofthe pregnancy can prevent FAS. There is no amount ofalcohol use during pregnancy that has been proven to becompletely safe.
There is no racial or ethnic predilection for FAS."
"There is no racial or ethnic predilection for FAS.
Individuals from different genetic backgrounds exposedto similar amounts of alcohol during pregnancy mayexhibit different signs or symptoms of FAS. Several stud-ies have estimated that between 25–45% of chronic alco-holic women will give birth to a child with FAS if theycontinue to drink during pregnancy. The risk of FASappears to increase as a chronic alcoholic woman pro-gresses in her childbearing years and continues to drink.That is, a child with FAS will often be one of the lastborn to a chronic alcoholic woman, although older sib-lings may exhibit milder features of FAS. Binge drink-ing, defined as sporadic use of five or more standardalcoholic drinks per occasion, and “moderate” dailydrinking (two to four 12 oz bottles of beer, eight to 16ounces of wine, two to four ounces of liquor) can alsoresult in offspring with features of FAS.

"Causes and symptoms
FAS is not a genetic or inherited disorder. It is a pat-
tern of birth defects, learning, and behavioral problemsthat are the result of maternal alcohol use during thepregnancy. The alcohol freely crosses the placenta andcauses damage to the developing embryo or fetus. Alco-hol use by the father cannot cause FAS. If a woman whohas FAS drinks alcohol during pregnancy, then she mayalso have a child with FAS. Not all individuals fromalcohol exposed pregnancies have obvious signs orsymptoms of FAS; individuals of different genetic back-grounds may be more or less susceptible to the damagethat alcohol can cause. The dose of alcohol, the time dur-ing pregnancy that alcohol is used, and the pattern ofalcohol use all contribute to the different signs and symp-toms that are found.

"Classic features of FAS include short stature, low
birthweight and poor weight gain, microcephaly, and acharacteristic pattern of facial features. These facial fea-tures in infants and children may include small eye open-ings (measured from inner corner to outer corner), epican-thal folds (folds of tissue at the inner corner of the eye),small or short nose, low or flat nasal bridge, smooth orpoorly developed philtrum (the area of the upper lip abovethe colored part of the lip and below the nose), thin upper
lip, and small chin. Some of these features are nonspecific,meaning they can occur in other conditions, or be appro-priate for age, racial, or family background. Other majorand minor birth defects that have been reported includecleft palate, congenital heart defects, strabismus ,hearing
loss, defects of the spine and joints, alteration of the hand"
"loss, defects of the spine and joints, alteration of the hand
creases, small fingernails, and toenails. Since FAS wasfirst described in infants and children, the diagnosis issometimes more difficult to recognize in older adolescentsand adults. Short stature and microcephaly remain com-mon features, but weight may normalize, and the individ-ual may actually become overweight for his/her height.The chin and nose grow proportionately more than themiddle part of the face and dental crowding may become aproblem. The small eye openings and the appearance ofthe upper lip and philtrum may continue to be characteris-tic. Pubertal changes typically occur at the normal time.
Newborns with FAS may have difficulties with feed-
ing due to a poor suck, have irregular sleep-wake cycles,decreased or increased muscle tone, seizures or tremors ."
"Delays in achieving developmental milestones such asrolling over, crawling, walking and talking may becomeapparent in infancy. Behavior and learning difficulties typ-ical in the preschool or early school years include poorattention span, hyperactivity, poor motor skills, and slowlanguage development. Attention deficit-hyperactivity dis-order is a common associated diagnosis. Learning disabili-ties or mental retardation may be diagnosed during thistime. Arithmetic is often the most difficult subject for achild with FAS. During middle school and high schoolyears the behavioral difficulties and learning difficultiescan be significant. Memory problems, poor judgment, dif-ficulties with daily living skills, difficulties with abstractreasoning skills, and poor social skills are often apparentby this time. It is important to note that animal and humanstudies have shown that neurologic and behavioral abnor-malities can be present without characteristic facial fea-tures. These individuals may"
"abnor-malities can be present without characteristic facial fea-tures. These individuals may not be identified as havingFAS, but may fulfill criteria for alcohol- related diagnoses,as set forth by the Institute of Medicine."
"In 1991, Streissguth and others reported some of the
first long-term follow-up studies of adolescents andadults with FAS. In the approximate 60 individuals theystudied, the average IQ was 68, with 70 being the lowerlimit of the normal range. However, the range of IQ wasquite large, as low as 20 (severely retarded) to as high as105 (normal). The average achievement levels for read-ing, spelling, and arithmetic were fourth grade, thirdgrade and second grade, respectively. The VinelandAdaptive Behavior Scale was used to measure adaptivefunctioning in these individuals. The composite score forthis group showed functioning at the level of a seven-

"year-old. Daily living skills were at a level of nine years,
and social skills were at the level of a six-year-old.
In 1996, Streissguth and others published further data"
"regarding the disabilities in children, adolescents andadults with FAS. Secondary disabilities, that is, those dis-abilities not present at birth and that might be preventablewith proper diagnosis, treatment, and intervention, weredescribed. These secondary disabilities include: mentalhealth problems; disrupted school experiences; troublewith the law; incarceration for mental health problems,drug abuse, or a crime; inappropriate sexual behavior;alcohol and drug abuse; problems with employment;dependent living; and difficulties parenting their own chil-dren. In that study, only seven out of 90 adults were livingand working independently and successfully. In additionto the studies by Streissguth, several other authors in dif-ferent countries have now reported on long term outcomeof individuals diagnosed with FAS. In general, the neuro-logic, behavioral and emotional disorders become themost problematic for the individuals. The physical featureschange over time, sometimes making the"
"problematic for the individuals. The physical featureschange over time, sometimes making the correct diagnosismore difficult in older individuals, without old pho-tographs and other historical data to review. Mental healthproblems including attention deficit, depression, panicattacks, psychosis and suicide threats and attempts, and"
"overall were present in over 90% of the individuals studiedby Streissguth. A 1996 study in Germany reported morethan 70% of the adolescents they studied had persistentand severe developmental disabilities and many had psy-chiatric disorders, the most common of which were emo-tional disorders, repetitive habits, speech disorders , and
hyperactivity disorders.
Diagnosis
FAS is a clinical diagnosis, which means that there
is no blood, x ray or psychological test that can be per-formed to confirm the suspected diagnosis. The diagno-sis is made based on the history of maternal alcohol use,and detailed physical examination for the characteristic"
"major and minor birth defects and characteristic facialfeatures. It is often helpful to examine siblings and par-ents of an individual suspected of having FAS, either inperson or by photographs, to determine whether findingson the examination might be familial, of if other siblingsmay also be affected. Sometimes, genetic tests are per-formed to rule out other conditions that may present withdevelopmental delay or birth defects. Individuals withdevelopmental delay, birth defects or other unusual fea-tures are often referred to a clinical geneticist, develop-mental pediatrician, or neurologist for evaluation anddiagnosis of FAS. Psychoeducational testing to deter-mine IQ and/or the presence of learning disabilities mayalso be part of the evaluation process.KEY TERMS

"Treatment
There is no treatment for FAS that will reverse or
change the physical features or brain damage associatedwith maternal alcohol use during the pregnancy. Most ofthe birth defects associated with prenatal alcohol expo-sure are correctable with surgery. Children should havepsychoeducational evaluation to help plan appropriateeducational interventions. Common associated diagnosessuch as attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, depres-sion, or anxiety should be recognized and treated appro-"
"priately. The disabilities that present during childhoodpersist into adult life. However, some of the secondarydisabilities mentioned above may be avoided or lessenedby early and correct diagnosis, better understanding ofthe life-long complications of FAS, and intervention.Streissguth has describe a model in which an individualaffected by FAS has one or more advocates to help pro-vide guidance, structure and support as the individualseeks to become independent, successful in school oremployment, and develop satisfying social relationships.
Prognosis
The prognosis for FAS depends on the severity of
birth defects and the brain damage present at birth. Mis-
carriage ,stillbirth or death in the first few weeks of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1311Fetal alcohol syndrome"
"life may be outcomes in very severe cases. Major birth
defects associated with FAS are usually treatable withsurgery. Some of the factors that have been found toreduce the risk of secondary disabilities in FAS individ-uals include diagnosis before the age of six years, stableand nurturing home environments, never having experi-enced personal violence, and referral and eligibility fordisability services. The long-term data helps in under-standing the difficulties that individuals with FASencounter throughout their lifetime and can help fami-lies, caregivers and professionals provide the care,supervision, education and treatment geared towardtheir special needs.
Prevention of FAS is the key. Prevention efforts must
include public education efforts aimed at the entire popu-lation, not just women of child bearing age, appropriatetreatment for women with high-risk drinking habits, andincreased recognition and knowledge about FAS by pro-fessionals, parents, and caregivers.

Fetal hemoglobin test
Definition
Fetal hemoglobin (Hemoglobin F), Alkali-resistant
hemoglobin, HBF (or Hb F), is the major hemoglobincomponent in the bloodstream of the fetus. After birth, itdecreases rapidly until only traces are found in normalchildren and adults.

"Purpose
The determination of fetal hemoglobin is an aid in
evaluating low concentrations of hemoglobin in theblood (anemia), as well as the hereditary persistence offetal hemoglobin, and a group of inherited disordersaffecting hemoglobin, among which are the thalassemiasand sickle cell anemia.
Description
At birth, the newborn’s blood is comprised of
60%–90% of fetal hemoglobin. The fetal hemoglobinthen rapidly decreases to 2% or less after the second tofourth years. By the time of adulthood, only traces (0.5%or less) are found in the bloodstream.
In some diseases associated with abnormal hemo-
globin production (see Hemoglobinopathy, below), fetalhemoglobin may persist in larger amounts. When thisoccurs, the elevation raises the question of possibleunderlying disease.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1312Fetal hemoglobin test"
"For example, HBF can be found in higher levels in
hereditary hemolytic anemias , in all types of leukemias,
in pregnancy , diabetes, thyroid disease, and during anti-
convulsant drug therapy. It may also reappear in adultswhen the bone marrow is overactive, as in the disordersof pernicious anemia ,multiple myeloma , and metastat-
ic cancer in the marrow. When HBF is increased after
age four, it should be investigated for cause.
Hemoglobinopathy
Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying pigment found
in red blood cells. It is a large molecule made in the bonemarrow from two components, heme and globin.
Defects in hemoglobin production may be either
genetic or acquired. The genetic defects are further sub-divided into errors of heme production (porphyria), andthose of globin production (known collectively as thehemoglobinopathies ).
There are two categories of hemoglobinopathy. In"
"There are two categories of hemoglobinopathy. In
the first category, abnormal globin chains give rise toabnormal hemoglobin molecules. In the second category,normal hemoglobin chains are produced but in abnormalamounts. An example of the first category is the disorderof sickle cell anemia, the inherited condition character-ized by curved (sickle-shaped) red blood cells and chron-ic hemolytic anemia . Disorders in the second category
are called the thalassemias, which are further dividedinto types according to which amino acid chain is affect-ed (alpha or beta), and whether there is one defectivegene ( thalassemia minor) or two defective genes (tha-
lassemia major).
Preparation
This test requires a blood sample. The patient is not
required to be in a fasting state (nothing to eat or drink
for a period of hours before the test).
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or"
"slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or

Reference values vary from laboratory to laboratory
but are generally found within the following ranges:
• six months to adult: up to 2% of the total hemoglobin• newborn to six months: up to 75% of the total hemoglo-
binKEY TERMS
Anemia —A disorder characterized by a reduced
blood level of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carryingpigment of blood.
Hemolytic anemia —A form of anemia caused by
premature destruction of red cells in the bloodstream (a process called hemolysis). Hemolyticanemias are classified according to whether thecause of the problem is inside the red blood cell(in which case it is usually an inherited condition),or outside the cell (usually acquired later in life).
Abnormal results
Greater than 2% of total hemoglobin is abnormal.

Fever
Definition
A fever is any body temperature elevation over
100°F (37.8°C).
Description
A healthy person’s body temperature fluctuates
between 97°F (36.1°C) and 100°F (37.8°C), with theaverage being 98.6°F (37°C). The body maintains stabili-ty within this range by balancing the heat produced by themetabolism with the heat lost to the environment. The“thermostat” that controls this process is located in thehypothalamus, a small structure located deep within thebrain. The nervous system constantly relays informationabout the body’s temperature to the thermostat, which inturn activates different physical responses designed to"
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1313Fever
"cool or warm the body, depending on the circumstances.
These responses include: decreasing or increasing theflow of blood from the body’s core, where it is warmed,to the surface, where it is cooled; slowing down or speed-ing up the rate at which the body turns food into energy(metabolic rate); inducing shivering, which generates heatthrough muscle contraction; and inducing sweating,which cools the body through evaporation.
A fever occurs when the thermostat resets at a higher
temperature, primarily in response to an infection. Toreach the higher temperature, the body moves blood tothe warmer interior, increases the metabolic rate, andinduces shivering. The “chills” that often accompany afever are caused by the movement of blood to the body’score, leaving the surface and extremities cold. Once thehigher temperature is achieved, the shivering and chillsstop. When the infection has been overcome or drugssuch as aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol) have been"
"taken, the thermostat resets to normal and the body’scooling mechanisms switch on: the blood moves to thesurface and sweating occurs.Fever is an important component of the immune
response, though its role is not completely understood.Physicians believe that an elevated body temperature hasseveral effects. The immune system chemicals that reactwith the fever-inducing agent and trigger the resetting ofthe thermostat also increase the production of cells thatfight off the invading bacteria or viruses. Higher temper-atures also inhibit the growth of some bacteria, while atthe same time speeding up the chemical reactions thathelp the body’s cells repair themselves. In addition, theincreased heart rate that may accompany the changes inblood circulation also speeds the arrival of white bloodcells to the sites of infection.
Causes and symptoms

infections, such as pneumonia or influenza . However,"

age to the hypothalamus. When an infection occurs,fever-inducing agents called pyrogens are released, eitherby the body’s immune system or by the invading cellsthemselves, that trigger the resetting of the thermostat. Inother circumstances, the immune system may overreact(allergic reactions) or become damaged (autoimmune dis-eases), causing the uncontrolled release of pyrogens. Astroke or tumor can damage the hypothalamus, causing
the body’s thermostat to malfunction. Excessive exposureto the sun or intensely exercising in hot weather can resultin heat stroke, a condition in which the body’s coolingmechanisms fail.

How long a fever lasts and how high it may go
depends on several factors, including its cause, the age ofthe patient, and his or her overall health. Most feverscaused by infections are acute, appearing suddenly andthen dissipating as the immune system defeats the infec-tious agent. An infectious fever may also rise and fallthroughout the day, reaching its peek in the late after-noon or early evening.

cause of a fever.
Treatment
Physicians agree that the most effective treatment
for a fever is to address its underlying cause, such asthrough the administration of antibiotics . Also, because"
"a fever helps the immune system fight infection, it usual-ly should be allowed to run its course. Drugs to lowerfever (antipyretics) can be given if a patient (particularlya child) is uncomfortable. These include aspirin, aceta-minophen (Tylenol), and ibuprofin (Advil). Aspirin,however, should not be given to a child or adolescentwith a fever since this drug has been linked to anincreased risk of Reye’s syndrome . Bathing a patient in
cool water can also help alleviate a high fever.
A fever requires emergency treatment under the fol-
lowing circumstances:
• newborn (three months or younger) with a fever over
100.5°F (38°C)
• infant or child with a fever over 103°F (39.4°C)• fever accompanied by severe headache , neck stiffness,
mental confusion, or severe swelling of the throat
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1315Fever"
"A very high fever in a small child can trigger
seizures (febrile seizures) and therefore should be treatedimmediately. A fever accompanied by the above symp-toms can indicate the presence of a serious infection,such as meningitis , and should be brought to the imme-
diate attention of a physician.
Prognosis
Most fevers caused by infection end as soon as the
immune system rids the body of the pathogen and do notproduce any lasting effects. The prognosis for feversassociated with more chronic conditions, such as autoim-mune disease, depends upon the overall outcome of thedisorder.

Fever evaluation tests
Definition
Fever evaluation tests, better known as febrile
agglutinins tests, are performed to detect the presence ofantibodies in the blood that are sensitive to temperaturechanges. Antibodies are proteins produced by theimmune system in response to specific infectious agents,such as viruses or bateria. Febrile agglutinins are anti-bodies that cause red blood cells to clump, but only whenthe blood is warmed to temperatures higher than theaverage body temperature of 98.6°F (37°C).
Purpose
The febrile agglutinins test is used to confirm the
diagonsis of certain infectious diseases that stimulate thebody to produce febrile agglutinins. The disease mostcommonly diagnosed by this test is brucellosis , a infec-
tion caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Brucellaand characterized by intermittent fever, sweating, chills,"
"aches, and mental depression. The test is also used todiagnose certain other infectious diseases: salmonellosis,caused by Salmonella bacteria and marked by nausea and
severe diarrhea ; rickettsial infections, a group of dis-
eases caused by the bacteria Rickettsia ; and tularemia ,
also called rabbit fever, a bacterial infection character-ized by a high fever and swollen lymph nodes. Thefebrile agglutinins test can also be used to confirm thepresence of two types of cancer , leukemia and lym-
phoma; however, doctors rarely use the test for this pur-pose, since other diagnostic tests are more reliable.

"Description
A febrile agglutinins test can be performed at a doc-
tor’s office or a hospital. A nurse or technician will col-lect a few drops of blood (about 7ml) in a small tube thathas been cooled slightly. The specimen is then taken to alaboratory where it heated and examined for clumping. Ifthe cells clump after warming and unclump as they cool,a febrile agglutinin titer (concentration) of greater than1:80 is present.
Normal results
The results of febrile agglutinins tests require a doc-
tor’s interpretation. In general, however, a normal valueis lower than 1:32.
Abnormal results
An value higher than 1:80 suggests a diagnosis for
brucellosis or one of the other conditions indicated bythis test.

Fever of unknown origin
Definition
Fever of unknown origin (FUO) refers to the pres-
ence of a documented fever for a specified time, forwhich a cause has not been found after a basic medicalevaluation. The classic criteria developed in 1961 includ-ed: temperature greater than 101°F (38.3°C), for at leastthree weeks, and inability to find a cause after one weekof study. Within the past decade, a revision has been pro-posed that categorizes FUO into classic, hospitalacquired FUO, FUO associated with low white bloodcounts, and HIV associated FUO ( AIDS related).

"Description
Fever is a natural response of the body that helps in
fighting off foreign substances, such as microorganisms,toxins, etc. Body temperature is set by the thermoregula-tory center, located in an area in the brain called hypo-thalamus. Body temperature is not constant all day, butactually is lowest at 6 
A.M. and highest around 4–6 P.M. In
addition, temperature varies in different regions of thebody; for example, rectal and urine temperatures areabout one degree Fahrenheit higher than oral temperatureand rectal temperature is higher than urine. It is alsoimportant to realize that certain normal conditions caneffect body temperature, such as pregnancy , food inges-
tion, age, and certain hormonal changes.
Substances that cause fever are known as “pyro-"
"tion, age, and certain hormonal changes.
Substances that cause fever are known as “pyro-
gens.” There are two types of pyrogens; exogenous andendogenous. Those that originate outside the body, suchas bacterial toxins, are called “exogenous” pyrogens.Pyrogens formed by the body’s own cells in response toan outside stimulus (such as a bacterial toxin) are called“endogenous” pyrogens.
Researchers have discovered that there are several
“endogenous” pyrogens. These are made up of smallgroups of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.These natural pyrogens have other functions in additionto inducing fever; they have been named “cytokines”.When cytokines are injected into humans, fever andchills develop within an hour. Interferon, tumor necrosisfactor, and various interleukins are the major fever pro-ducing cytokines.
The production of fever is a very complex process;"
"The production of fever is a very complex process;
somehow, these cytokines cause the thermoregulatorycenter in the hypothalamus to reset the normal tempera-ture level. The body’s initial response is to conserve heatby vasoconstriction, a process in which blood vessels nar-row and prevent heat loss from the skin and elsewhere.This alone will raise temperature by two to three degrees.Certain behavioral activities also occur, such as addingmore clothes, seeking a warmer environment, etc. If thehypothalamus requires more heat, then shivering occurs.
Fever is a body defense mechanism. It has been
shown that one of the effects of temperature increase is toslow bacterial growth. However, fever also has somedownsides; the body’s metabolic rate is increased andwith it, oxygen consumption. This can have a devastatingeffect on those with poor circulation. In addition, fevercan lead to seizures in the very young.

"When temperature elevation occurs for an extended
period of time and no cause is found, the term FUO isthen used. The far majority of these patients are eventual-ly found to have one of several diseases.KEY TERMS

"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) —This is a
new technique similar to CT Scan, but based onthe magnetic properties of various areas of thebody to compose images.
NSAID —Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

Ultrasound —A non-invasive procedure based on
changes in sound waves of a frequency that can-not be heard, but respond to changes in tissuecomposition. It is very useful for diagnosing dis-eases of the gallbladder, liver, and hidden infec-tions, such as abscesses.
Causes and symptoms
The most frequent cause of FUO is still infection,
though the percentage has decreased in recent years.Tuberculosis remains an important cause, especially"
"when it occurs outside the lungs. The decrease in infec-tions as a cause of FUO is due in part to improved culturetechniques. In addition, technological advances havemade it easier to diagnose non-infectious causes. Forexample, tumors and autoimmune diseases in particularare now easier to diagnose. (An autoimmune disease isone that arises when the body tolerance for its own cellantigenic cell markers disappears.)
Allergies to medications can also cause prolonged
fever; sometimes patients will have other symptoms sug-gesting an allergic reaction, such as a rash.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1317Fever of unknown origin"
"There are many possible causes of FUO; generally
though, a diagnosis can be found. About 10% of patientswill wind up without a definite cause, and about the samepercentage have “factitious fevers” (either self inducedor no fever at all).
Some general symptoms tend to occur along with
fever; these are called constitutional symptoms and con-sist of myalgias (muscle aches), chills, and headache .
Diagnosis
Few symptoms in medicine present such a diagnos-
tic challenge as fever. Nonetheless, if a careful, logical,and thorough evaluation is performed, a diagnosis will befound in most cases. The patient’s past medical history aswell as travel, social, and family history should be care-fully searched for important clues.

"Usually the first step is to search for an infectious
cause. Skin and other screening tests for diseases such astuberculosis, and examination of blood, urine, and stool,are generally indicated. Antibody levels to a number ofinfectious agents can be measured; if these are rising,they may point to an active infection.
Various x-ray studies are also of value. In addition to
standard examinations, recently developed radiologicaltechniques using ultrasound, computed tomography scan(CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
are now available. These enable physicians to examineareas that were once accessible only through surgery. Fur-thermore, new studies using radioactive materials (nuclearmedicine), can detect areas of infection and inflammationpreviously almost impossible to find, even with surgery.
Biopsies of any suspicious areas found on an x-ray"
"Biopsies of any suspicious areas found on an x-ray
exam can be performed by either traditional or newersurgical techniques. Material obtained by biopsy is thenexamined by a pathologist to look for clues as to thecause of the fever. Evidence of infection, tumor or otherdiseases can be found in this way. Portions of the biopsyare also sent to the laboratory for culture in an attempt togrow and identify an infectious organism.
Patients with HIV are an especially difficult prob-
lem, as they often suffer from many unusual infections.HIV itself is a potential cause of fever.
Treatment
Most patients who undergo evaluation for FUO do not
receive treatment until a clear-cut cause is found. Antibi-
otics or medications designed to suppress a fever (such as
NSAIDs) will only hide the true cause. Once physicians aresatisfied that there is no infectious cause, they may use med-ications such as NSAIDs, or corticosteroids to decrease"
"inflammation and diminish constitutional symptoms.The development of FUO in certain settings, such as
that acquired by patients in the hospital or in those with alow white blood count , often needs rapid treatment to
avoid serious complications. Therefore, in these instancespatients may be placed on antibiotics after a minimalnumber of diagnostic studies. Once test results areknown, treatment can be adjusted as needed.
Prognosis
The outlook for patients with FUO depends on the
cause of the fever. If the basic illness is easily treatableand can be found rather quickly, the potential for a cureis quite good. Some patients continue with temperatureelevations for six months or more; if no serious disease isfound, medications such as NSAIDs are used to decreasethe effects of the fever. Careful follow-up and reevalua-tion is recommended in these cases.

with DIC, a serious medical condition that developswhen the normal balance between bleeding and clottingis disturbed. Excessive bleeding and clotting injuresbody organs, and causes anemia or death .
Description
Coagulation begins typically with an injury to some
part of the body. The injury sets in motion a cascade ofbiochemical activities (the coagulation cascade) to stopthe bleeding, by forming a clot from a mixture of theblood protein fibrin and platelets.
Once bleeding is stopped, another blood protein dis-
solves the clot by breaking down the fibrin into frag-ments. Measurement of these fragments gives informa-tion about the clot dissolving portion of coagulation,called fibrinolysis.
In DIC, the coagulation cascade is triggered in an
abnormal way. A blood infection, a transfusion reaction,"
"abnormal way. A blood infection, a transfusion reaction,
a large amount of tissue damage, such as a burn, a deadfetus, and some cancers can begin the chain of biochemi-cal events leading to blood clots. The coagulation cas-cade becomes overwhelmed with excessive clotting fol-lowed by excessive bleeding. As the large number ofclots dissolve, fibrin split products accumulate in theblood and encourage even more bleeding.

"Laboratory tests for FSP are done on the yellow liq-
uid portion left over after blood clots (serum). A person’sserum is mixed with a substance that binds to FSP. Thisbound complex is measured, and the original amount ofFSP is determined. Some test methods give an actualmeasurement of FSP; some give a titer, or dilution.Methods that provide a titer look for the presence orabsence of FSP. If the serum is positive for FSP, theserum is diluted, or titered, and the test is done again.These steps are repeated until the serum is so dilute thatit no longer gives a positive result. The last dilution thatgives a positive result is the titer reported.
The FSP test is covered by insurance when medical-
ly necessary. Results are usually available within one totwo hours. Other names for this test are fibrin degrada-tion products, fibrin breakdown products, or FDP.

Fibrinogen test
Definition
Fibrinogen (Factor I) is a protein that originates in
the liver. It is converted to fibrin during the blood-clot-ting process (coagulation).
Purpose
The fibrinogen test aids in the diagnosis of suspected
clotting or bleeding disorders caused by fibrinogenabnormalities.
Precautions
This test is not recommended for patients with active
bleeding, acute infection or illness, or in those patientswho have received blood transfusions within four weeks.
Drugs that may increase fibrinogen levels include
estrogens and oral contraceptives . Drugs that may cause
decreased levels include anabolic steroids, androgens,phenobarbital, urokinase, streptokinase, and valproic acid.
Description
Fibrinogen plays two essential roles in the body: it is"
"Description
Fibrinogen plays two essential roles in the body: it is
a protein called an acute-phase reactant that becomes ele-vated with tissue inflammation or tissue destruction, andit is also a vital part of the “common pathway” of thecoagulation process.
In order for blood to clot, fibrinogen must be con-
verted to fibrin by the action of an enzyme called throm-bin. Fibrin molecules clump together to form long fila-ments, which trap blood cells to form a solid clot.The conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin is the last step
of the “coagulation cascade,” a series of reactions in theblood triggered by tissue injury and platelet activation.With each step in the cascade, a coagulation factor in theblood is converted from an inactive to an active form.The active form of the factor then activates several mole-cules of the next factor in the series, and so on, until thefinal step, when fibrinogen is converted into fibrin.
The factors involved in the coagulation cascade are"
"The factors involved in the coagulation cascade are
numbered I, II, and V through XIII. Factor I is fibrino-gen, while factor II (fibrinogen’s immediate precursor) iscalled prothrombin. Most of the coagulation factors aremade in the liver, which needs an adequate supply of vit-amin K to manufacture the different clotting factors.
When fibrinogen acts as an “acute-phase reactant,” it
rises sharply during tissue inflammation or injury. Whenthis occurs, high fibrinogen levels may be a predictor foran increased risk of heart or circulatory disease. Otherconditions in which fibrinogen is elevated are cancers ofthe stomach, breast, or kidney, and inflammatory disor-ders like rheumatoid arthritis .
Reduced fibrinogen levels can be found in liver dis-
ease, prostate cancer , lung disease, bone marrow"
"ease, prostate cancer , lung disease, bone marrow
lesions, malnourishment, and certain bleeding disorders.The low levels can be used to evaluate disseminatedintravascular coagulation (DIS), a serious medical condi-tion that develops when there is a disturbed balancebetween bleeding and clotting. Other conditions relatedto decreased fibrinogen levels are those in which fibrino-

"gen is completely absent (congenital afibrinogenemia),
conditions in which levels are low (hypofibrinogenemia),and conditions of abnormal fibrinogen (dysfibrinogene-mia). Obstetric complications or trauma may also causelow levels. Large-volume blood transfusions cause lowlevels because banked blood does not contain fibrinogen.
Preparation
This test is performed with a blood sample, which
can be drawn at any time of day. The patient does nothave to be fasting (nothing to eat or drink).
Aftercare
Because a fibrinogen test is often ordered when a
bleeding disorder is suspected, the patient should applypressure or a pressure dressing to the blood-drawn sitesite for a period of time after blood is drawn, and thenreexamine the site for bleeding.
Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include slight
bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or feeling
lightheaded after procedure, or the seeing the accumula-tion of blood under the puncture site (hematoma).
Normal results"
"Normal results
Normal reference ranges are laboratory-specific, but
are usually within the following:
• adult: 200 mg/dL–400 mg/dL
• newborn: 125 mg/dL–300 mg/dL
Abnormal results
Spontaneous bleeding can occur with values less
than 100 mg/dL.

Fibroadenomas are benign breast tumors commonly
found in young women. Fibroadenoma means “a tumorcomposed of glandular (related to gland) and fibrous(containing fibers) tissues.”

"Description
Breast fibroadenomas, abnormal growths of glandu-
lar and fibrous tissues, are most common between theages of 15 and 30, and are found in 10% of all women(20% of African-American women). They are foundrarely in postmenopausal women.
Described as feeling like marbles, these firm, round,
movable, and “rubbery” lumps range from 1–5 cm in size.Giant fibroadenomas are larger, lemon-sized lumps. Usuallysingle, from 10–15% of women have more than one.
While some types of breast lumps come and go dur-
ing the menstrual cycle, fibroadenomas typically do notdisappear after a woman’s period, and should be checkedby a doctor.
Causes and symptoms
The cause of breast fibroadenomas is unknown.
They may be dependent upon estrogen, because they arecommon in premenopausal women, can be found in post-menopausal women taking estrogen, and because theygrow larger in pregnant women.
Fibroadenomas usually cause no symptoms and may

"be discovered during breast self-examination , or during
a routine check-up.
Diagnosis
When the doctor takes a complete medical history,
they will ask when the lump was first noticed, if therewere any symptoms or changes in lump size, and if thereis any personal or family history of breast disease.
The doctor thoroughly feels the breasts (palpates).
Tests are done, usually including mammography or
ultrasound scans, or surgical removal of cells or tissuefor examination under a the microscope (biopsy).
Diagnostic tests include:
• Mammogram. An x-ray examination of the breast.• Ultrasound scan. A technique that uses sound waves to
display a two-dimensional image of the breast, showingwhether a lump is solid or fluid-filled (cystic).
• Fine-needle aspiration biopsy. A minor procedure
wherein fluid or cells are drawn out of the lump througha small needle (aspirated).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1321Fibroadenoma"
"• Core biopsy. A procedure wherein a larger piece of tis-
sue is withdrawn from the lump through a larger needle.
• Incisional biopsy. A surgical procedure wherein a piece
of the lump is removed through an cut (incision).
• Excisional biopsy. A surgical procedure wherein the
entire lump is removed through an cut (incision).
Most insurance plans cover the costs of diagnosing
and treating fibroadenomas.
Treatment
Performed usually in outpatient settings, breast
fibroadenomas are removed by lumpectomy , or surgi-
cal excision under local or general anesthesia. Some-times lumps in younger women are not removed but aremonitored by self-examination, yearly doctor check-ups, and mammograms. Surgery is generally recom-mended for women over 30, and for lumps that arepainful or enlarging.
Alternative treatments
Alternative treatments for breast fibroadenomas
include a low-fat, high-fiber, vegetarian-type diet; areduction in caffeine intake; supplementation with"
"evening primrose oil (Oenothera biennis), flax oil, orfish oil and vitamins E and C; and the application of hot
compresses to the breast. In addition, a focus on livercleansing is important to assist the body in conjugationand elimination of excess estrogens. Botanical remediescan be useful in hormone balancing, as can acupunc-
ture and homeopathy . Massaging the breasts with cas-
tor oil, straight or infused with herbs or essential oils,can help fibroadenomas reduce and dissipate, as well askeep women in touch with changes in their breast tissue.
Prognosis
Breast fibroadenomas are not cancerous. The lumps
recur in up to 20% of women. A small number of lumpsdisappear on their own.KEY TERMS
Aspiration —To withdraw material with a needle

disease, although it is clearly not a single, specific diseaseprocess. Variations or changes in the way the breast feels orlooks on x ray may cause the condition to be called “fibro-cystic change.” Other names have been used to refer to thisimprecise and ill-defined term: mammary dysplasia,mastopathy, chronic cystic mastitis , indurative mastopathy,
mastalgia, lumpy breasts, or physiologic nodularity.
Estimates vary, but 40–90% of all women have some
evidence of “fibrocystic” condition, change, or disease. Itis most common among women between the ages 30 and50, but may be seen at other ages.
Causes and symptoms
Fibrocystic condition of the breast refers to technical
findings on diagnostic testing (signs); however, this dis-cussion focuses on symptoms that may fall under thegeneral category of the fibrocystic condition. First, abrief review of the structure and function of the breastmay be useful."
"The breast is not supposed to be a soft, smooth organ.
It is actually a type of sweat gland. Milk, the breasts’ ver-sion of sweat, is secreted when the breast receives appro-priate hormonal and environmental stimulation.
The normal breast contains milk glands, with their
accompanying ducts, or pipelines, for transporting themilk. These complex structures may not only alter in size,but can increase or decrease in number as needed. Fibrousconnective tissue, fatty tissue, nerves, blood and lymphvessels, and lymph nodes, with their different shapes andtextures, lie among the ever-changing milk glands. It is nowonder that a woman’s breasts may not feel uniform intexture and that the “lumpiness” may wax and wane.
The fibrocystic condition refers to the tenderness,
enlargement, and/or changing “lumpiness” that manywomen encounter just before or during their menstrual
periods. At this time, female hormones are preparing thebreasts for pregnancy , by stimulating the milk-produc-"
"ing cells, and storing fluid. Each breast may contain asmuch as three to six teaspoons of excess fluid. Swelling,with increased sensitivity or pain , may result. If preg-
nancy does not occur, the body reabsorbs the fluid, andthe engorgement and discomfort are relieved.
Symptoms of fibrocystic breast condition range
from mildly annoying in some women to extremelypainful in others. The severity of discomfort may varyfrom month to month in the same woman. Althoughsometimes distressing, this experience is the body’s nor-mal response to routine hormonal changes.
This cycle of breast sensitivity, pain and/or enlarge-
ment, can also result from medications. Some hormonereplacement therapies (estrogen and progesterone) usedfor postmenopausal women can produce these effects.Other medications, primarily, but not exclusively thosewith hormones may also provoke these symptoms.
Breast pain unrelated to hormone shifts is called"
"Breast pain unrelated to hormone shifts is called
“noncyclic” pain. “Trigger-zone breast pain” is a termthat may also be used to describe this area-specific pain.This type of pain may be continuous, or it may be feltintermittently. Trauma, such as a blow to the chest area, aprior breast biopsy , or sensitivity to certain medications
may also underlie this type of pain. Fibrocystic conditionof the breast may be cited as the cause of otherwise unex-plained breast pain.
Lumps, apart from those clearly associated with hor-
mone cycles, may also be placed under the heading offibrocystic condition. These lumps stand out from enlargedgeneral breast tissue. Although noncancerous lumps mayoccur, the obvious concern with such lumps is cancer.
Noncancerous breast lumps include:
• Adenosis. This condition refers to the enlargement of
breast lobules, which contain a greater number of glandsthan usual. If a group of lobules are found near eachother, the affected area may be large enough to be felt."
"• Cysts. These are fluid-filled sacs in the breast and proba-
bly develop as ducts that become clogged with old cellsin the process of normal emptying and filling. Cysts usu-ally feel soft and round or oval. However a cyst deepwithin the breast may feel hard, as it pushes up againstfirmer breast tissue. A woman with a cyst may experi-ence pain, especially if it increases in size before hermenstrual cycle, as is often the case. Women between theage of 30 and 50 are most likely to develop cysts.
• Epithelial hyperplasia. Also called proliferative breast
disease, this condition refers to an overgrowth of cellslining either the ducts or the lobules.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1323Fibrocystic condition of the breast"
"• Fibroadenomas. These are tumors that form in the tis-
sues outside the milk ducts. The cause of fibroadeno-mas is unknown. They generally feel smooth and firm,with a somewhat rubber-like texture. Typically afibroadenoma is not attached to surrounding tissue and
moves slightly when touched. They are most common-ly found in adolescents and women in their early twen-ties but can occur at any age.
• Fibrosis. Sometimes one area of breast tissue persistently
feels thicker or more prominent than the rest of the breast.This feeling may be caused by old hardened scar tissueand/or dead fat tissue as a result of surgery or trauma.Often the cause of this type of breast tissue is unknown.
• Miscellaneous disorders. A number of other benign
(noncancerous) breast problems may be placed underthe heading of “fibrocystic condition.” These problemsinclude disorders that may lead to breast inflammation(mastitis), infection, and/or nipple discharge.
Atypical ductal hyperplasia"
"Atypical ductal hyperplasia
The condition known as atypical ductal hyperplasia
(ADH) is a condition in which the cells lining the milkducts of the breast are growing abnormally. This condi-tion may appear as spots of calcium salts, or calcifica-tions, on the mammogram. A biopsy removed from thebreast would confirm the diagnosis. Atypical ductalhyperplasia is not a cancer. In most women, this condi-tion will cause no problems. However, for some women,especially women with family histories of breast cancer,the risk of developing breast cancer is increased. (One
study with over 3,000 female participants indicated thatabout 20% of the participants with atypical hyperplasiaand a family history of breast cancer developed breastcancer, as compared to the 8% of participants who devel-oped the disease with atypical hyperplasia and no familyhistory of breast cancer.) For women with ADH and afamily history of breast cancer, more frequent mammo-grams and closer monitoring may be required."
"Diagnosis
Breast cancer is the most common concern of
women who feel a breast lump or experience an abnor-mal breast symptom. For peace of mind, and to rule outany possibility of cancer, any newly discovered breastlumps should be brought to the attention of a familyphysician or an obstetrician-gynecologist. He or she willobtain a history and conduct thorough physical exami-
nation of the area. Depending on the findings on physi-
cal examination, the patient is usually referred for tests.The most common of these tests include:
•Mammography . A mammogram is an x-ray examina-
tion of the breasts. The two major types of abnormali-ties doctors look for are masses and calcifications;either abnormality may be benign or malignant. Thesize, shape, and edges of these masses help doctorsdetermine whether or not cancer is present. Sometimes,however, this test may be difficult to interpret, however,due to dense breast tissue.
• Ultrasonography. If a suspicious lump is detected during"
"• Ultrasonography. If a suspicious lump is detected during
mammography, an ultrasound (the use of high-frequen-cy sound waves to outline the shape of various organsand tissues in the body) is useful (although not defini-tive) in distinguishing benign from cancerous growths.
• Ductography. A ductogram (also called a galactogram)
is a test that is sometimes useful in evaluating nippledischarge. A very fine tube is threaded into the openingof the duct onto the nipple. A small amount of dye isinjected, outlining the shape of the duct on an x ray, andindicates whether or not there is a mass in the duct.
• Biopsy. If a lump cannot be proven benign by mammog-"
"• Biopsy. If a lump cannot be proven benign by mammog-
raphy and ultrasound, a breast biopsy may be considered.Usually a tissue sample is removed through a needle(fine-needle aspiration biopsy, or FNAB) to obtain asample of the lump. The sample is examined under themicroscope by a pathologist, and a detailed diagnosisregarding the type of benign lesion or cancer is estab-lished. In some cases, however, FNAB may not provide aclear diagnosis, and another type of biopsy (such as asurgical biopsy, core-needle biopsy, or other stereotacticbiopsy methods—such as the Mammotome or AdvancedBreast Biopsy Instrument) may be required.

"Other breast conditions such as inflammation or
infection are usually recognized on the basis of suspi-cious history, breastfeeding, or characteristic symptomssuch as pain, redness, and swelling. A positive responseto appropriate therapies often confirms the diagnosis.
Treatment
Once a specific disorder within the broad category
of fibrocystic condition is identified, treatment can beprescribed. There are a number of treatment options forwomen with a lump that has been diagnosed as benign. Ifit is not causing a great deal of pain, the growth may beleft in the breast. However, some women may choose tohave a lump such as a fibroadenoma surgically removed,especially if it is large. Another option to relieve the dis-comfort of a painful benign lump is to have the cyst suc-tioned, or drained. If there is any uncertainty regardingdiagnosis, the fluid may be sent to the lab for analysis.
Symptoms of cycle breast sensitivity and engorge-"
"Symptoms of cycle breast sensitivity and engorge-
ment may also be treated with diet, medication, and/orphysical modifications. For example,
• Although there is no scientific data to support this
claim, many women have reported relief of symptomswhen caffeine was reduced or eliminated from their
diets . Decreasing salt before and during the period
when breasts are most sensitive may also ease swellingand discomfort. Low-fat diets and elimination of dairyproducts also appear to decrease soreness for somewomen. However, it may take several months to realizethe effects of these various treatments.
• Over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen
(Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) may be recommended.In some cases, treatment with prescription drugs suchas hormones or hormone blockers may prove success-ful. Oral contraceptives may also be prescribed.

"• Warm soaks or ice packs may provide comfort. A well-
fitted support bra can minimize physical movement anddo much to relieve breast discomfort. Breast massagemay promote removal of excess fluid from tissues andalleviate symptoms. Massaging the breast with castoroil, straight or infused with herbs or essential oils, canhelp reduce and dissipate fibroadenomas as well as keepwomen in touch with changes in their breast tissue.
• Infections are often treated with warm compresses and
antibiotics . Lactating women are encouraged to contin-
ue breastfeeding because it promotes drainage andhealing. However, a serious infection may progress toform an abscess that may need surgical drainage.
• Some studies of alternative or complementary treat-
ments, although controversial, have indicated that vita-
mins A, B complex and E, and mineral supplementsmay reduce the risk of developing fibrocystic condition
of the breast. Evening primrose oil ( Oenothera biennis ),"
"of the breast. Evening primrose oil ( Oenothera biennis ),
flaxseed oil, and fish oils have been reported to be effec-tive in relieving cyclic breast pain for some women.
Prognosis
Most benign breast conditions carry no increased
risk for the development of breast cancer. However, asmall percentage of biopsies uncover overgrowth of tis-sue in a particular pattern in some women; this patternindicates a 15–20% increased risk of breast cancer overthe next 20 years. Strict attention to early detection mea-sures, such as annual mammograms, is especially impor-tant for these women.
Prevention
There is no proven method of preventing the various
manifestations of fibrocystic condition from occurring.Some alternative health care practitioners believe thateliminating foods high in methyl xanthines (primarilycoffee and chocolate) can decrease or reverse fibrocysticbreast changes.

"Description
Fibromyalgia is more common than previously
thought, with as many as 3–6% of the population affect-ed by the disorder. Fibromyalgia is more prevalent inadults than children, with more women affected thanmen, particularly women of childbearing age.
Causes and symptoms
The exact cause of fibromyalgia is not known.
Sometimes it occurs in several members of a family,suggesting that it may be an inherited disorder. Peoplewith fibromyalgia are most likely to complain of threeprimary symptoms: muscle and joint pain, stiffness, andfatigue.
Pain is the major symptom with aches, tenderness,
and stiffness of multiple muscles, joints, and soft tissues.The pain also tends to move from one part of the body toanother. It is most common in the neck, shoulders, chest,arms, legs, hips, and back. Although the pain is presentmost of the time and may last for years, the severity ofthe pain is changeable and dependent on individualpatient perception."
"Symptoms of fatigue may result from the individ-
ual’s chronic pain coupled with anxiety about the prob-
lem and how to find relief. The inflammatory processalso produces chemicals that are known to cause fatigue.Other common symptoms are tension headaches, diffi-culty swallowing, recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea ,
and numbness or tingling of the extremities. Stress , anxi-
ety, depression, or lack of sleep can increase symptoms.Intensity of symptoms is variable ranging from gradualimprovement to episodes of recurrent symptoms.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is difficult and frequently missed because
symptoms of fibromyalgia are vague and generalized.Coexisting nerve and muscle disorders such as rheuma-
toid arthritis , spinal arthritis, or Lyme disease may fur-
ther complicate the diagnostic process. Presently, there areno tests available to specifically diagnose fibromyalgia.The diagnosis is usually made after ruling out other med-ical conditions with similar symptoms."
"Because of the emotional distress experienced by
people with this condition and the influence of stress onthe symptoms themselves, fibromyalgia has often beenlabeled a psychological problem. Recognition of the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1326Fibromyalgia"
"underlying inflammatory process involved in fibromyal-
gia has helped promote the validity of this disease.
In 1990, the America College of Rheumatology
developed standards for fibromyalgia that health carepractitioners can use to diagnose this condition. Accord-ing to these standards, a person is thought to havefibromyalgia if he or she has widespread pain in combi-nation with tenderness in at least 11 of the 18 sitesknown as trigger points. Trigger point sites include thebase of the neck, along the backbone, in front of the hipand elbow, and at the rear of the knee and shoulder.
Treatment
There is no known cure for fibromyalgia. Therefore,
the goal of treatment is successful symptom manage-ment. Treatment usually requires a combination of thera-pies, exercise , proper rest, and diet. A patient’s clear
understanding of his or her role in the recovery process isimperative for successful management of this condition.

"Treatments found to be helpful include heat and occa-
sionally cold applications. A regular stretching program isoften useful. Aerobic activities focusing on increasing theheart rate are the preferred forms of exercise over mostother forms of exertion. Exercise programs need to includegood warm-up and cool-down sessions, with special atten-tion given to avoiding exercises causing joint pain. Thediet should include a large variety of fruits and vegetableswhich provide the body with trace elements and minerals
that are necessary for healthy muscles.
Adequate rest is essential in the treatment of
fibromyalgia. Avoidance of stimulating foods or drinks(such as coffee) and medications like decongestants
prior to bedtime is advised. If diet, exercise, and ade-quate rest do not relieve the symptoms of fibromyalgia,medications may be prescribed. Medications prescribedand found to have some benefit include antidepressant
drugs ,muscle relaxants , and anti-inflammatory drugs."
"drugs ,muscle relaxants , and anti-inflammatory drugs.
People with fibromyalgia often need a rheumatology
consultation (a meeting with a doctor who specializes indisorders of the joints, muscles, and soft tissue) to decidethe cause of various rheumatic symptoms, to be educatedabout fibromyalgia and its treatment, and to exclude otherrheumatic diseases. A treatment program must be individ-ualized to meet the patient’s needs. The rheumatologist,as the team leader, enlists and coordinates the expertise ofother health professionals in the care of the patient.
Alternative treatment
Massage therapy can be helpful, especially when a
family member is instructed on specific massage tech-niques to manage episodes of increased symptoms. Spe-KEY TERMS

Lyme disease —An acute recurrent inflammatory
disease involving one or a few joints, believed tobe transmitted by a tickborne virus. The conditionwas originally described in the community ofLyme, Connecticut, but has also been reported inother parts of the United States and other coun-tries. Knees, other large joints are most commonlyinvolved with local inflammation and swelling.
Rheumatology —The study of disorders character-
ized by inflammation, degeneration of connectivetissue, and related structures of the body. Thesedisorders are sometimes collectively referred to asrheumatism.
cific attention to mental health, including psychological
consultation, may also be important, since depressionmay precede or accompany fibromyalgia. Other alterna-tive therapies, including hellerwork ,rolfing , homeo-
pathic medicine, Chinese traditional medicine (bothacupuncture and herbs), polarity therapy , and Western"
"botanical medicine, can assist the person with fibromyal-gia to function day to day and can contribute to healing.
Prognosis
Fibromyalgia is a chronic problem. The symptoms
sometimes improve and at other times worsen, but theyoften continue for months to years.
Prevention
There is no known or specific way to prevent
fibromyalgia. However, similar to many other medicalconditions, remaining as healthy as possible with a gooddiet, safe exercise, and adequate rest is the best prevention.

Fifth disease
Definition
Fifth disease is a mild childhood illness caused by
the human parvovirus B19 that causes flu-like symptomsand a rash. It is called fifth disease because it was fifth ona list of common childhood illnesses that are accompa-nied by a rash, including measles ,rubella or German
measles, scarlet fever (or scarlatina), and scarlatinella, a
variant of scarlet fever .
Description
The Latin name for the disease is erythema infectio-
sum, meaning infectious redness. It is also called the"
"sum, meaning infectious redness. It is also called the
“slapped cheek disease” because, when the bright redrash first appears on the cheeks, it looks as if the face hasbeen slapped. Anyone can get the disease, but it occursmore frequently in school-aged children. The disease isusually mild, and both children and adults usually recov-er quickly without complications. In fact, some individu-als exhibit no symptoms and never even feel ill. Out-breaks most often occur in the winter and spring.
Causes and symptoms
Fifth disease is caused by the human parvovirus B19,
a member of the Parvoviridae family of viruses, that livesin the nose and throat of the infected person. The virus isspread through the air by coughing and sneezing. Becausethe virus needs a rapidly dividing cell in order to multiply,it attacks the red blood cells of the body. Once infected, aperson is believed to be immune to reinfection.
Symptoms may appear four to 21 days after being"
"Symptoms may appear four to 21 days after being
exposed to the virus. Initial symptoms are flu-like andinclude headache , body ache, sore throat , a mild fever
of 101°F (38.3°C), and chills. It is at this time, prior tothe development of the rash, that individuals are conta-gious. These symptoms last for two to three days. In chil-dren, a bright red rash that looks like a slap mark devel-ops suddenly on the cheeks. The rash may be flat orraised and may or may not be itchy. Sometimes, the rashspreads to the arms, legs, and trunk, where it has a lace-like or net-like appearance. The rash can also involve thepalms of the hands and soles of the feet. By the time therash appears, individuals are no longer infectious. Onaverage, the rash lasts for 10–11 days, but may last for aslong as five to six weeks. The rash may fade away andthen reappear upon exposure to sunlight, hot baths, emo-tional distress, or vigorous exercise .

"Adults generally do not develop a rash, but instead may
have swollen and painful joints, especially in the hands andfeet. In adults, symptoms such as sore throat, headache,muscle and joint pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea , and vom-
iting occur more frequently than in children and are usuallymore severe. The joint pain can be arthritis-like and last forseveral months, especially in women, but the disease doesnot appear to progress to rheumatoid arthritis .
The virus causes the destruction of red blood cells
and, therefore, a deficiency in the oxygen-carryingcapacity of the blood (anemia) can result. In healthy peo-ple, the anemia is mild and only lasts a short while. Inpeople with weakened immune systems, however, eitherbecause they have a chronic disease like AIDS or cancer"
"(immunocompromised), or are receiving medication tosuppress the immune system (immunosuppressed), suchas organ transplant recipients, this anemia can be severeand last long after the infection has subsided. Symptomsof anemia include fatigue , lack of color, lack of energy,
and shortness of breath . Some individuals with sickle
cell anemia, iron deficiency, a number of different hered-itary blood disorders, and those who have received bonemarrow transplantations may be susceptible to develop-ing a potentially life-threatening complication called atransient aplastic crisis where the body is temporarilyunable to form new red blood cells.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1328Fifth disease"
"In very rare instances, the virus can cause inflamma-
tion of different areas of the body, including the brain(encephalitis ), the covering of the brain and spinal cord
(meningitis ), the lungs (pneumonitis), the liver (hepati-
tis), and the heart muscle ( myocarditis ). The virus can
also aggravate symptoms for people with an autoimmunedisease called systemic lupus erythematosus .
There is some concern about fifth disease in pregnant
women. Although no association with an increased numberof birth defects has been demonstrated, there is concern
that infection during the first three months of pregnancy
may lead to a slight increase in the number of miscarriages.There is also some concern that infection later in pregnancymay involve a very small risk of premature delivery or still-births. As a result, women who get fifth disease while theyare pregnant should be monitored closely by a physician.

"Diagnosis
Fifth disease is usually suspected based on a
patient’s symptoms, including the typical appearance ofthe bright red rash on the cheeks, patient history, age, andthe time of year. The physician will also exclude otherpotential causes for the symptoms and rash, includingrubella, infectious mononucleosis , bacterial infections
like Lyme disease , allergic reactions, and lupus.
In addition, there is a blood test for fifth disease, but it
is generally used only for pregnant women and for peoplewho have weakened immune systems or who suffer fromblood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia. The testinvolves measuring for a particular antibody or protein thatthe body produces in response to infection with the humanparvovirus B19. The test is 92–97% specific for this disease.
Because fifth disease can pose problems for an unborn"
"Because fifth disease can pose problems for an unborn
fetus exposed to the disease through the mother, testingmay also be conducted while a fetus is still in the uterus.This test uses fluid collected from the sac around the fetus(amniotic fluid) instead of blood to detect the viral DNA.
Treatment
In general, no specific treatment for fifth disease is
required. The symptoms can be treated using over-thecounter medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol)
or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil). If the rash itches, calaminelotion can be applied. Aspirin is usually not given to
children under the age of 18 to prevent the developmentof a serious illness called Reye’s syndrome .
Patients who are receiving medications to suppress
the immune system in the treatment of some other condi-tion may be allowed to temporarily decrease the medica-tions in order to allow the immune system to combat theinfection and recover from the anemia. Those with weak-KEY TERMS

Generally, fifth disease is mild, and patients tend to
improve without any complications. In cases where thepatient is either immunocompromised or immunosup-pressed, a life-threatening aplastic crisis can occur. Withprompt treatment, however, the prognosis is good. Moth-ers who develop the infection while pregnant can passthe infection on to their fetus, and as such, stand anincreased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth . There are

Approximately 170 million people in the tropical and
subtropical areas of southeast Asia, South America, Africa,and the islands of the Pacific are affected by this debilitat-ing parasitic disease. While filariasis is rarely fatal, it is thesecond leading cause of permanent and long-term disabili-ty in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO)has named filariasis one of only six “potentially eradica-ble” infectious diseases and has embarked upon a 20-yearcampaign to eradicate the disease.
In all cases, a mosquito first bites an infected indi-"
"In all cases, a mosquito first bites an infected indi-
vidual then bites another uninfected individual, transfer-ring some of the worm larvae to the new host. Once with-in the body, the larvae migrate to a particular part of thebody and mature to adult worms. Filariasis is classifiedinto three distinct types according to the part of the bodythat becomes infected: lymphatic filariasis affects the cir-culatory system that moves tissue fluid and immune cells(lymphatic system); subcutaneous filariasis infects theareas beneath the skin and whites of the eye; and serouscavity filariasis infects body cavities but does not causedisease. Several different types of worms can be respon-sible for each type of filariasis, but the most commonspecies include the following: Wucheria bancrofti, Bru-
gia malayi (lymphatic filariasis), Onchocerca volvulus,
Loa loa, Mansonella streptocerca, Dracunculus medi-nensis (subcutaneous filariasis), Mansonella pustans ,"
"and Mansonella ozzardi (serous cavity filariasis).
The two most common types of the disease are Ban-
croftian and Malayan filariasis, both forms of lymphaticfilariasis. The Bancroftian variety is found throughoutAfrica, southern and southeastern Asia, the Pacificislands, and the tropical and subtropical regions of SouthAmerica and the Caribbean. Malayan filariasis occursonly in southern and southeastern Asia. Filariasis is occa-sionally found in the United States, especially amongimmigrants from the Caribbean and Pacific islands.
A larvae matures into an adult worm within six"
"A larvae matures into an adult worm within six
months to one year and can live between four and sixyears. Each female worm can produce millions of larvae,and these larvae only appear in the bloodstream at night,when they may be transmitted, via an insect bite, to anoth-er host. A single bite is usually not enough to acquire aninfection, therefore, short-term travelers are usually safe.A series of multiple bites over a period of time is requiredto establish an infection. As a result, those individuals whoare regularly active outdoors at night and those who spendmore time in remote jungle areas are at an increased riskof contracting the filariasis infection.

"Causes and symptoms
In cases of lymphatic filariasis, the most common
form of the disease, the disease is caused by the adultworms actually living in the lymphatic vessels near thelymph nodes where they distort the vessels and cause localinflammation. In advanced stages, the worms can actuallyobstruct the vessels, causing the surrounding tissue tobecome enlarged. In Bancroftian filariasis, the legs andgenitals are most often involved, while the Malayan vari-ety affects the legs below the knees. Repeated episodes ofinflammation lead to blockages of the lymphatic system,especially in the genitals and legs. This causes the affectedarea to become grossly enlarged, with thickened, coarseskin, leading to a condition called elephantiasis.
In conjunctiva filariasis, the worms’ larvae migrate
to the eye and can sometimes be seen moving beneaththe skin or beneath the white part of the eye (conjuncti-va). If untreated, this disease can cause a type of blind-ness known as onchocerciasis."
"Symptoms vary, depending on what type of parasitic
worm has caused the infection, but all infections usually

"begin with chills, headache, and fever between three
months and one year after the insect bite. There may alsobe swelling, redness, and pain in the arms, legs, or scro-
tum. Areas of pus (abscesses) may appear as a result ofdying worms or a secondary bacterial infection.

"performing a physical examination , and by screening
blood specimens for specific proteins produced by theimmune system in response to this infection (antibodies).Early diagnosis may be difficult because, in the firststages, the disease mimics other bacterial skin infections.To make an accurate diagnosis, the physician looks for apattern of inflammation and signs of lymphatic obstruc-tion, together with the patient’s possible exposure tofilariasis in an area where filariasis is common. The lar-vae (microfilariae) can also be found in the blood, butbecause mosquitos, which spread the disease, are activeat night, the larvae are usually only found in the bloodbetween about 10 pm and 2 am.

"Treatment
Either ivermectin, albendazole, or diethylcarba-
mazine is used to treat a filariasis infection by eliminat-ing the larvae, impairing the adult worms’ ability toreproduce, and by actually killing adult worms. Unfortu-nately, much of the tissue damage may not be reversible.The medication is started at low doses to prevent reac-tions caused by large numbers of dying parasites.
While effective, the medications can cause severe
side effects in up to 70% of patients as a result either ofthe drug itself or the massive death of parasites in the
blood. Diethylcarbamazine, for example, can causesevere allergic reactions and the formation of pus-filledsores (abscesses). These side effects can be controlledusing antihistamines and anti-inflammatory drugs ( cor-
ticosteroids ). Rarely, treatment with diethylcarbamazine
in someone with very high levels of parasite infectionmay lead to a fatal inflammation of the brain ( encephali-
tis). In this case, the fever is followed by headache and"
"tis). In this case, the fever is followed by headache and
confusion, then stupor and coma caused when massive
numbers of larvae and parasites die. Other common drugreactions include dizziness , weakness, and nausea.
Symptoms caused by the death of the parasites
include fever, headache, muscle pain, abdominal pain,nausea and vomiting , weakness, dizziness, lethargy, and
asthma . Reactions usually begin within two days of start-
ing treatment and may last between two and four days.
No treatment can reverse elephantiasis. Surgery may
be used to remove surplus tissue and provide a way to drainthe fluid around the damaged lymphatic vessels. Surgery
may also be used to ease massive enlargement of the scro-tum. Elephantiasis of the legs can also be helped by elevat-ing the legs and providing support with elastic bandages.

"Prognosis
The outlook is good in early or mild cases, especially
if the patient can avoid being infected again. The diseaseis rarely fatal, and with continued WHO medical inter-vention, even gross elephantiasis is now becoming rare.
Prevention
The best method of preventing filariasis is to prevent
being repeatedly bitten by the mosquitoes that carry thedisease. Some methods of preventing insect bites includethe following:
• limit outdoor activities at night, particularly in rural or
jungle areas
• wear long sleeves and pants and avoid dark-colored
clothing that attracts mosquitoes
• avoid perfumes and colognes• treat one or two sets of clothing ahead of time with per-
methrin (Duramon, Permanone)
• wear DEET insect repellent or, especially for children,
try citronella or lemon eucalyptus, to repel insects
• if sleeping in an open area or in a room with poor
screens, use a bed net to avoid being bitten while asleep
• use air conditioning, the cooler air makes insects less
active"
"• use air conditioning, the cooler air makes insects less
active
In addition, filariasis can be controlled in highly infest-
ed areas by taking ivermectin preventatively before beingbitten. Currently, there is no vaccine available, but scien-tists are working on a preventative vaccine at this time.

Description
The fingertips are specialized areas of the hand with
highly developed sensory and manipulative functions.Large sensory and motor areas located in the brain regu-late the precise and delicate functions of fingertips. Thefingertip is the site where extensor and flexor tendonsinsert. Fingertip injuries are extremely common since thehands hold a wide array of objects. In 2001, the approxi-mately 10% of all accidents in the United States referredfor Emergency Room consults involve the hand. Handinjuries are frequently the result of job injuries andaccount for 11–14% of on-the-job injuries and 6% ofcompensation paid injuries. Injury to the nail bed occursin approximately 15–24% of fingertip injuries.
Fingertip injuries can result in amputation or tissue"
"Fingertip injuries can result in amputation or tissue
loss. The injury is assessed whether the bone and underly-ing tissue are intact and the size of the wound area. Thepulp is the area of skin opposite the fingernail and is usu-ally very vulnerable to injury. Pulp injuries commonlyoccur in persons who use or are in close contact with fastmoving mechanical devices. These injuries can crush, cut,and puncture. The fingertips can also be injured by com-mon crushing accidents. This could cause the develop-ment of a subungal hematoma (an accumulation of bloodunder the nail). At the base of the distal phalanx (the firstcircular skin fold from the tip) injuries can occur that canfracture the underlying bone in the area. Quite commonly

"Causes and symptoms
Accidental amputations will usually result in profuse
bleeding and tissue loss. Injuries to the pulp can occur asfrom fast moving mechanical instruments, such as drills.These injuries may puncture the pulp. Injuries such as asubungal hematoma are caused by a crushing type injury.Fractures typically occur as the result of crushing injuriesor tendon avulsion. These crushing injuries are frequentlycaused during sport injury and can be treated by simpleinterventions such as immobilization or more complex
procedures if tendons are affected (the trauma is thentreated as a tendon injury). Fractures can cause pain and,
depending on the extent of swelling, there may be somerestriction of movement. Tendon injuries can be causedwhen the terminal joint is exposed to force flexing motion(moving the finger toward the palm) while held straight.
Diagnosis
The attending clinician should evaluate the injury in"
"a careful and systematic manner. The appearance of thehand can provide valuable information concerning pres-ence of fractures, vascular status, and tendon involve-ment. Bones and joints should be evaluated for motionand tenderness. Nerves should be examined for sensory(feeling sensations) and motor (movement) functioning.Amputations usually profusely bleed and there is tissueloss. The wound is treated based on loss of tissue, bone,and wound area. Injuries to the pulp can be obvious dur-ing inspection.

Conservative treatment is recommended forcrush injuries that fracture the terminal phalanx if a sub-ungal hematoma is not present. Severe fractures near thefist circular skin crease may require surgical correctionto prevent irregularity of the joint surface, which cancause difficulty with movement.

Fish and shellfish poisoning
Definition
Fish and shellfish poisoning is a common but often
unrecognized group of illnesses related to food. Three ofthese illnesses include ciguatera, scombroid, and paralyt-ic shellfish poisoning.

"Ciguatera
Definition
Ciguatera (from the Spanish word for a poisonous
snail) is a food-related illness that causes abdominal andneurological symptoms.
Causes and symptoms
Ciguatera is caused by eating fish that have a toxin
called ciguatoxin. Scientists believe this toxin is acquiredby the fish through the food chain, and is originally pro-duced by small algae microorganisms (dinoflagellates).The fish most likely contaminated with ciguatoxin arethose that feed close to tropical reefs, including red snap-per, grouper, and barracuda. Larger fish are more likelyto contain the toxin. Although not as common in theUnited States, ciguatera is commonly diagnosed onmany of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.
Illness from ciguatera can occur in just a few min-
utes to about 30 hours after eating. Most cases occur oneto six hours after eating the contaminated fish. Initialsymptoms are abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, orwatery diarrhea . The most characteristic symptoms of"
"the illness are those involving the nervous system. Theseinclude numbness and tingling around the lips, tongue,
and mouth; itching ; dry mouth ; metallic taste in the
mouth; and blurry vision. In more prominent cases,patients may complain of temporary blindness, a slowpulse, and a feeling that their teeth are loose. Patientsmay also have the strange symptom of reversal of hot andcold sensations on the skin, where cold things feel veryhot or painful to the touch. In very severe cases, theremay be difficulties in breathing or low blood pressure.

"Diagnosis
Ciguatera diagnosis is based on the typical combina-
tion of symptoms after eating fish. There are no readilyavailable blood or urine tests to detect the poisoning, butsome researchers have developed a test for the toxin lefton any remaining fish. A person does not have to be in atropical area to get ciguatera. Fish can be caught fromone of these distant areas, and can then be shipped andeaten locally. It is important to report suspected cases tolocal public health officials because more cases mayoccur from other contaminated fish.
Treatment
The treatment for this illness is general. Patients are
given fluids (by mouth or through a vein) and medica-tions to decrease the itching or to treat vomiting and/ordiarrhea. The neurological symptoms can cause discom-fort and treatment with amitriptyline (a medicine that hasbeen used for depression) may be useful. Other medica-tions may also be given.

"Prognosis
Although death can occur, almost all patients diag-
nosed with ciguatera will recover. Recovery, however,can be slow and some symptoms can last for weeks oreven months. Symptoms can also be aggravated by otherillnesses or alcohol.
Prevention
Knowing the kinds of fish linked to ciguatera can
help a person avoid eating high-risk fish. However, over400 different kinds of fish have been linked to the dis-ease, even salmon. A particular fish in a given area maybe more likely to cause ciguatera than other fish. Forexample, red snapper is most often the source of ciguat-era in the Pacific, while barracuda is more likely to con-tain the toxin in Florida. This is why it is illegal to sellbarracuda in Florida for human consumption. Cookingthe fish does not prevent ciguatera.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1334Fish and shellfish poisoning"
"Scombroid
Definition
Scombroid is a fish-associated illness caused by eat-
ing improperly handled fish. Fish linked to this diseaseare usually in the Scombridae family, which includes yel-lowfin tuna, skipjack, bonito, and mackerel.
Causes and symptoms
Scombroid occurs after eating fish that has not
been properly refrigerated after capture. Unlike ciguat-era, the toxins linked with scombroid are not contractedby the fish from its surroundings. Bacteria that are nor-mally found in fish act directly on a chemical (calledhistidine) in the flesh of fish that are not properlycooled when stored. This interaction produces hista-mine and other chemicals that cause the illness whenthe fish is eaten.
Symptoms of scombroid occur quickly after eating"
"Symptoms of scombroid occur quickly after eating
the fish, as soon as 10 minutes. Since histamine isreleased by certain cells in the body during an allergicreaction, scombroid can be confused with a fish allergy.Scombroid causes flushing of the face, sweating, a burn-ing feeling in the mouth or throat, vomiting, diarrhea,and headaches. A rash that looks like a sunburn may
occur, and a small number of patients have hives . Some
patients have a metallic or peppery taste in their mouths.In more severe cases, rapid pulse, blurred vision, and dif-ficulty breathing can occur. Symptoms usually last aboutfour hours.
Diagnosis
Like ciguatera, scombroid poisoning is diagnosed"
"Diagnosis
Like ciguatera, scombroid poisoning is diagnosed
based on typical symptoms occurring after eating fish.There are usually no available tests for the patient.Experimentally, however, elevated levels of histamine-related products have been found in the urine. It maybe possible for public health officials to test anyremaining fish flesh for histamine levels. Improperlyrefrigerated fish caught in both temperate and tropicalwaters have been linked to the illness. An outbreak ofsimilar cases may be helpful in correctly diagnosingthe problem.
Treatment
The treatment for scombroid is usually general.
Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may
shorten the duration of the illness, but the illness will goaway on its own. Some doctors have found that cimeti-dine (Tagamet) given through a vein may be helpful aswell. In rare, more severe cases, epinephrine (adrenaline)may be used.KEY TERMS

Histamine —A chemical found naturally in the

Toxin —A poisonous substance usually produced

Prognosis
Although sometimes dramatic and alarming symptoms
can occur, scombroid is usually not serious. The patientshould be reassured that scombroid is not a fish allergy.
Prevention
Adequate storage of the target fish will always pre-
vent scombroid. Since the fish does not appear spoiled orsmell bad, the consumer cannot detect the risk of the ill-ness before eating the fish. Cooking the fish does not pre-vent scombroid. Suspected cases should be reported topublic health officials.

"Paralytic shellfish poisoning
Definition
Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a nervous system
disease caused by eating cooked or raw shellfish that con-tain environmental toxins. These toxins are produced by agroup of algae (dinoflagellates). It is unclear whether thesetoxins are related to the “blooming” of the algae, alsocalled red tide because the algae can turn the water reddishbrown. PSP occurs mostly in May through November.
Causes and symptoms
PSP develops usually within minutes after eating a
contaminated shellfish, most commonly a mussel, clam,or oyster. Symptoms include headache , a floating feel-
ing,dizziness , lack of coordination, and tingling of the
mouth, arms, or legs. Muscle weakness causing difficultyswallowing or speaking may occur. Abdominal symptomssuch as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can also occur.Unlike ciguatera and scombroid, PSP may have a muchmore serious outcome. PSP may cause difficulty breath-ing related to weakness or paralysis of the breathing"
"muscle. The symptoms may last for six to 12 hours, but apatient may continue to feel weak for a week or more.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1335Fish and shellfish poisoning"
"Diagnosis
PSP diagnosis is based on symptoms after eating
shellfish, even if the shellfish are adequately cooked. Noblood or urine test is available to diagnose the illness, buttests in mice to detect the toxin from the eaten fish can bedone by public health officials.
Treatment
The treatment of PSP is mostly supportive. If early
symptoms are recognized, the doctor will try to flush thetoxin from the gastrointestinal tract with medications thatcreate diarrhea. V omiting may be induced if the patienthas no signs of weakness. In cases where the muscles ofbreathing are weakened, the patient may be placed on arespirator until the weakness goes away. However, thismeasure is not usually needed. Likewise, the use of amachine to clean the blood (dialysis) has been used insevere cases.

"Prognosis
The prognosis for PSP is quite good, especially if
the patient has passed the initial 12 hours of illness with-out needing breathing support. Most deaths occur duringthis period if breathing help is not available.
Prevention
Measures to control PSP require detecting rising
numbers of algae in coastal waters by periodic micro-scopic examination. By law, shellfish beds are closedwhen levels of the toxin-producing organisms are aboveacceptable standards. Cooking the shellfish does not pre-vent this disease. Suspected cases should be reported topublic health officials.

Definition
Flesh-eating disease is more properly called necro-
tizing fasciitis, a rare condition in which bacteria destroytissues underlying the skin. This tissue death , called
necrosis or gangrene , spreads rapidly. This disease can
be fatal in as little as 12 to 24 hours.
Description

"Description
Although the term is technically incorrect, flesh-eat-
ing disease is an apt descriptor: the infection appears todevour body tissue. Media reports increased in the mid-dle and late 1990s, but the disease is not new. Hip-pocrates described it more than three millennia ago andthousands of reports exist from the Civil War. Approxi-mately 500 to 1,500 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occurin the United States each year.
Flesh-eating disease is divided into two types. Type I
is caused by anaerobic bacteria, with or without the pres-ence of aerobic bacteria. Type II, also called hemolyticstreptococcal gangrene, is caused by group A streptococ-ci; other bacteria may or may not be present. The diseasemay also be called synergistic gangrene.
Type I fasciitis typically affects the trunk, abdomen,"
"Type I fasciitis typically affects the trunk, abdomen,
and genital area. For example, Fournier’s gangrene is a“flesh-eating” disease in which the infection encompass-es the external genitalia. The arms and legs are mostoften affected in type II fasciitis, but the infection mayappear anywhere.
Causes and symptoms
The two most important factors in determining
whether or not a person will develop flesh-eating diseaseare: the virulence (ability to cause disease) of the bacteriaand the susceptibility (ability of a person’s immune sys-tem to respond to infection) of the person who becomesinfected with this bacteria.
In nearly every case of flesh-eating disease, a skin
injury precedes the disease. As bacteria grow beneath theskin’s surface, they produce toxins. These toxins destroysuperficial fascia, subcutaneous fat, and deep fascia. Insome cases, the overlying dermis and the underlyingmuscle are also affected.
Initially, the infected area appears red and swollen"
"Initially, the infected area appears red and swollen
and feels hot. The area is extremely painful, which is aprominent feature of the disease. Over the course ofhours or days, the skin may become blue-gray, and fluid-filled blisters may form. As nerves are destroyed the area
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1336Flesh-eating disease"
"becomes numb. An individual may go into shock and
develop dangerously low blood pressure. Multiple organfailure may occur, quickly followed by death.
Diagnosis
The appearance of the skin, paired with pain and
fever raises the possibility of flesh-eating disease. An x
ray,magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed
tomography scans (CT scans) of the area reveals a
feathery pattern in the tissue, caused by accumulatinggas in the dying tissue. Necrosis is evident duringexploratory surgery, during which samples are collectedfor bacterial identification.
Treatment
Rapid, aggressive medical treatment, specifically,
antibiotic therapy and surgical debridement , is impera-
tive. Antibiotics may include penicillin, an aminoglyco-
side or third-generation cephalosporin, and clindamycinor metronidazole. Analgesics are employed for pain con-"
"trol. During surgical debridement, dead tissue is strippedaway. After surgery, patients are rigorously monitored forcontinued infection, shock, or other complications. Ifavailable, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has also be used.
Prognosis
Flesh-eating disease has a fatality rate of about 30%.
Diabetes, arteriosclerosis, immunosuppression, kidneydisease, malnutrition , and obesity are connected with a
poor prognosis. Older individuals and intravenous drugusers may also be at higher risk. The infection site alsohas a role. Survivors may require plastic surgery and mayhave to contend with permanent physical disability andpsychological adjustment.
Prevention
Flesh-eating disease, which occurs very rarely, can-
not be definitively prevented. The best ways to lower therisk of contracting flesh-eating disease are:
• take care to avoid any injury to the skin that may give

Flower remedies
Definition
Flower remedies are specially prepared flower
essences, containing the healing energy of plants. Theyare prescribed according to a patient’s emotional disposi-tion, as ascertained by the therapist, doctor, or patientsthemselves.
Purpose
Flower remedies are more homeopathic than herbal
in the way they work, effecting energy levels rather thanchemical balances. They have been described as “liquidenergy.” The theory is that they encapsulate the flowers’healing energy, and are said to deal with and overcomenegative emotions, and so relieve blockages in the flowof human energy that can cause illness.

"Description
Origins
Perhaps the most famous and widely used system is
the Bach flower remedies. This system originated in the1920s when British physician and bacteriologist, Dr.Edward Bach (1886–1936), noticed that patients withphysical complaints often seemed to be suffering fromanxiety or some kind of negative emotion. He concluded
that assessing a patient’s emotional disposition and pre-scribing an appropriate flower essence could treat thephysical illness. Bach was a qualified medical doctor, buthe also practiced homeopathy .
As a result of his own serious illness in 1917, Bach"
"As a result of his own serious illness in 1917, Bach
began a search for a new and simple system of medicinethat would treat the whole person. In 1930, he gave up hisflourishing practice on Harley Street at the Royal LondonHomeopathic Hospital and moved to the countryside todevote his life to this research. It is known that at thispoint, he ceased to dispense the mixture of homeopathyand allopathic medicine that he had been using. Instead, hebegan investigating the healing properties of plantessences and discovered that he possessed an “intuition”for judging the properties of each flower. Accordingly, hedeveloped the system of treatment that bears his name, andis also the foundation for all other flower-remedy systems.
The Bach Flower Remedies were ostensibly the only"
"The Bach Flower Remedies were ostensibly the only
system of significance from the 1920s until in the 1970s,when there was a renewed interest in the subject by doc-tors working in the field of natural medicine. Perhaps themost notable was Dr. Richard Katz, who was seeking newmethods of dealing with modern stress and the resulting
ailments. He focused on the concept of a psychic, psycho-logical effect and chose to pursue this line of research.
In 1979, Katz founded the Flower Essence Society
in California, (FES). This society pledged to further theresearch and development of Bach’s principles. As of2000, FES hosts a database of over 100 flower essencesfrom more than 50 countries. FES is now an internationalorganization of health practitioners, researchers, stu-dents, and others concerned with flower essence therapy.

"The Society has connections with an estimated
50,000 active practitioners from around the world, whouse flower essence therapy as part of their treatment. FESencourages the study of the plants themselves to deter-mine the characteristics of flower essences. They arecompiling an extensive database of case studies and prac-titioner reports of the use of essences therapeutically,allowing verification and development of the originaldefinitions. They are also engaged in the scientific studyof flower essence therapy.
FES says they have developed the theories of Paracel-
sus and Goethe who researched the “signatures” and “ges-tures” of botanical specimens, on the premise that thehuman body and soul are a reflection of the system ofnature. FES plant research interprets the therapeutic prop-erties of flower essences according to these insights.
In this regard, they have devised 12 “windows of"
"In this regard, they have devised 12 “windows of
perception” for monitoring the attributes of plants. Eachof these windows reveals an aspect of the plant’s quali-ties, although they maintain that what they are seeking isa “whole which is greater than the sum of its parts.” The12 windows are not considered independent classifica-tions, but more of a blended tapestry of views of thequalities that each plant possesses.
The first window is concerned with the “form” of a
plant—its shape classification. The second focuses on its“gesture” or spatial relationship. The third window is aplant’s botanical classification; the Flower Essence Soci-ety maintains that considering a plant’s botanical family
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1338Flower remedies"
is essential to obtaining an overview of its properties as a
"flower essence. The fourth window concerns the time ori-entation of a particular specimen regarding the daily andseasonal cycles. Why do some flowers bloom at differenttimes of the day, while others, such as the evening prim-rose, respond to the moon? The fifth window observes aplant’s relationship to its environment. Where a plantchooses to grow, and where it cannot survive, revealsmuch about its qualities. The sixth window observes aplant’s relationship to the Four Elements and the FourEthers, as FES maintains that plants exist in one of theelemental or etheric forces in addition to their physicallife. “Elements” refers to those developed by the Greeks,as opposed to the modern concept of “molecular buildingblocks.” It seems that commonly, two elements predomi-nate in a plant, indicating a polarity of qualities, whiletwo can be said to be recessive. The seventh windowrelates to a plant’s relationship with the other kingdoms ofnature: mineral, animal and human, while the eighthrelates"
"relationship with the other kingdoms ofnature: mineral, animal and human, while the eighthrelates to the color and color variations of a plant. Katzexplains how the language of color tells us so much aboutthe “soul qualities” of a plant. The ninth window concernsall other sensory perceptions of a plant, such as fragrance,texture, and taste. The tenth window involves assessingthe chemical substances and properties; the eleventh stud-ies medicinal and herbal uses, as by studying the physicalhealing properties of plants, we can also understandsomething of their more subtle effects on the soul. Finally,the twelfth window involves the study of the lore, mythol-ogy, folk wisdom, and spiritual and ritual qualities associ-ated with a particular plant. Katz relates how in the past,human beings were more in touch with the natural world,and the remnants of this unconscious plant wisdom liveon in the form of folklore, mythology, and so on."
"Because flower remedies operate on approximately
the same principles as homeopathy, practitioners quiteoften prescribe the two therapies in conjunction witheach other. They can also be used concurrently with allo-pathic medicine.
The system consists of 38 remedies, each for a dif-
ferent disposition. The basic theory is that if the remedyfor the correct disposition is chosen, the physical illnessresulting from the present emotional state can then becured. There is a rescue remedy made up of five of theessences—cherry plum, clematis, impatiens, rock star,and star of Bethlehem—that is recommended for thetreatment of any kind of physical or emotional shock.Therapists recommended that rescue remedy be kept onhand to help with all emergencies.

"Originally, Bach collected the dew from chosen
flowers by hand to provide his patients with the requiredremedy. This became impractical when his treatmentbecame so popular that production could not keep upwith demand. He then set about finding a way to manu-facture the remedies, and found that floating the freshlypicked petals on the surface of spring water in a glassbowl and leaving them in strong sunlight for three hoursproduced the desired effect. Therapists explain that thewater is “potentized” by the essence of the flowers. Thepotentized water can then be bottled and sold. For morewoody specimens, the procedure is to boil them in a ster-ilized pan of water for 30 minutes. These two methodsproduce “mother tinctures” and the same two methods

"The remedies are administered from a stoppered
bottle and need to be diluted. Individuals sensitive toalcohol can apply the concentrate directly to temples,wrists, behind the ears, or underarms. They should bekept in a cool dark place; like this they should last indef-initely. However, a diluted remedy should not be keptlonger than three weeks. Two drops of each diluted rem-edy should be taken four times a day, including firstthing in the morning and last thing at night. If the rescueremedy is being used, four drops should be used instead.Most therapists recommend that they be taken in springwater, but the remedy can be taken directly from the bot-tle, if care is taken that the dropper does not touch thetongue, as this would introduce bacteria that would spoilthe remedy.

"It is not recommended that more than six or seven
Bach remedies be used at any one time. Instead, it ispreferable to divide a larger amount up into two lots toensure the optimum effectiveness of the remedies. Nocombination, or amount of combinations of the remediescan cause any harm, rather they become less effective.
Unlike FES, the Bach Centre does not encourage
research to “prove” that the remedies work, preferringthat people find out for themselves. They strive to keepthe use of the Bach remedies as simple as possible, andto this end they do not keep case records. Bach warnedbefore he died that others would try to change his workand make it more complicated. He was determined tokeep it simple so that anyone could use it, and that is whyhe limited the system to only 38 remedies. The Centrepoints out that many who have used Bach’s research as astarting point have added other remedies to the list, evensome that Bach himself rejected.

"species of parasitic flatworms (Trematodes) that have
complex life cycles involving hosts other than humanbeings. Trematode comes from a Greek word that meanshaving holes and refers to the external suckers that adultflukes use to draw nourishment from their hosts. Flukeinfections are contracted by eating uncooked fish, plants,or animals from fluke-infected waters. Symptoms varyaccording to the type of fluke infection.

"Description
In humans, fluke infections can be classified accord-
ing to those diseases caused by liver flukes and thosecaused by lung flukes. Diseases caused by liver flukesinclude fascioliasis, opisthorchiasis, and clonorchiasis.Cases of liver fluke infection have been reported in Europeand the United States, as well as the Middle East, China,Japan, and Africa. Diseases caused by lung flukes includeparagonimiasis. Paragonimiasis is a common infection inthe Far East, Southeast Asia, Africa, Central and SouthAmerica, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands. It is estimatedthat between 40 million and 100 million people worldwidesuffer from either liver or lung fluke infections.
In their adult stage, liver and lung flukes are sym-
metrical in shape, ranging between 1/4–1 in in length,and look somewhat like long, plump leaves or blades ofgrass. They enter through the mouth and can infect anyperson at any age.Causes and symptoms
The symptoms of fluke infection differ somewhat"
"The symptoms of fluke infection differ somewhat
according to the type of fluke involved. All forms of liverand lung fluke infection, however, have the followingcharacteristics:
• most persons who get infected do not develop symp-
toms (asymptomatic)
• the early symptoms of an acute fluke infection are not
unique to these diseases alone (nonspecific symptoms)
• infection does not confer immunity against re-infection
by the same species or infection by other species offlukes
• infection is usually associated with eating uncooked
fish, plants, or animals that live in fresh water
Fascioliasis

"Fascioliasis
Fascioliasis is caused by Fasciola hepatica , the
sheep liver fluke. The fluke has a three-part life cycle thatbegins when eggs from a host’s feces are deposited inwater. The eggs release free-swimming larvae(miracidia) that infect snails. The snails then release free-swimming larvae with tails (cercariae) that form cystscontaining larvae in the infective stage (metacercariae)on vegetation growing in fresh water. Humans becomeinfected when they eat watercress, water chestnuts, orother plants covered with the encysted metacercariae.
When a person eats contaminated plants, the cysts
are broken open in the digestive system, and the metacer-cariae leave their cysts, pass through the wall of theintestine, and enter the liver, where they cause inflamma-tion and destroy tissue. After a period of 10–15 weeks inthe liver, the adult flukes move to the bile ducts and pro-duce eggs. Acute fascioliasis is marked by abdominalpain with headache , loss of appetite, anemia, and vomit-"
"ing. Some patients develop hives , muscle pains, or a yel-
low-color to the skin and whites of the eyes ( jaundice ).
Chronic forms of the disease may produce complica-tions, including blockage of the bile ducts or the migra-tion of adult flukes to other parts of the body.
Opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis
These infections are caused by Clonorchis sinensis ,
the Chinese liver fluke, and Opisthorchis viverrini or O.
felineus . The diseases are widespread, affecting more
than 20 million people in Japan, China, Southeast Asia,and India. The life cycle of these liver flukes is similar tothat of F . hepatica except that the etacercariae are encyst-
ed in freshwater fish rather than on plants. Dogs, cats,and other mammals that eat raw fish can be infected withopisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis.

"The symptoms of opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis are
similar to those of fascioliasis and include both acute andchronic forms. In acute infection, the patient may be tired,have a low-grade fever , pains in the joints, a swollen liver,
abdominal pain, and a skin rash. The acute syndrome maybe difficult to diagnose because the fluke eggs do not appearin the patient’s stool for three to four weeks after infection.Patients with the chronic form of the disease experience aloss of appetite, fatigue , low-grade fever, diarrhea , and an
enlarged liver that feels sore when the abdomen is pressed.

Their life cycle is similar to thatof liver flukes except that their encysted larvae infect crabsand crayfish rather than plants or fish. Humans can ingestthe encysted metacercariae from drinking contaminatedwater or eating raw or undercooked crabs and crayfish.
In humans, the metacercariae are released from their
cysts in the small intestine and migrate to the lungs or thebrain in 1% of cases. In the lungs, the flukes lay theireggs and form areas of inflammation covered with a thinlayer of fibrous tissue. These areas of infection mayeventually rupture, causing the patient to cough up fluke

Some patients also develop diarrhea and abdominal painor lumps under the skin that contain adult flukes.
Diagnosis"
"Diagnosis
Diagnosis of fluke infections is based on a combina-
tion of the patient’s history, particularly travel or resi-dence in areas known to have flukes, and identification ofthe fluke’s eggs or adult forms. In some patients, the eggsare found in fluid from the lungs, bile duct, or smallintestine. Samples of these fluids can be obtained with asuction instrument (aspirator). Because most types offluke infections are rare in the United States, stool speci-mens or body fluid samples may need to be sent to a lab-oratory with experts in unusual diseases or conditions toidentify the specific parasite. In some cases, adult flukesmay be found in the patient’s stools, vomit, sputum, orskin lumps (for lung flukes). In the case of lung flukes, itis important for the doctor to rule out tuberculosis as a
possible diagnosis. A tuberculosis skin test and chest x
raywill usually be sufficient to do this.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1343Fluke infections"
"Blood tests may be useful in diagnosing fluke
infections, but their usefulness is limited because ofcross-reactions. A cross-reaction occurs in blood testingwhen a particular disease agent reacts with antibodiesspecific to another disease agent. This result means thatthe doctor may know that the person is infected byflukes but cannot tell from the blood test alone whichspecific type of fluke is causing the disease. In addition,blood tests for fluke infections cannot distinguishbetween past and current infections. In some cases,sophisticated imaging techniques, such as computed
tomography scans (CT scans) or ultrasound scans of
the patient’s chest or brain (for lung flukes) or abdomen(for liver flukes), are useful in confirming a diagnosisof fluke infection.
Treatment

"Treatment
Liver and lung fluke infections are treated with med-
ications. These include triclabendazole, praziquantel,bithionol, albendazole, and mebendazole. Praziquantelworks by paralyzing the flukes’ suckers, forcing them todrop away from the walls of the host’s blood vessels. Inthe United States, bithionol is available only from theCenters for Disease Control (CDC). Depending on thespecies of fluke and the severity of infection, the courseof treatment can vary from several days to several weeks.Cure rates vary from 50–95%. Most patients experiencemild temporary side effects from these drugs, includingdiarrhea, dizziness , or headache.
Prognosis
The prognosis for recovery from liver fluke infec-
tions is good, although patients with serious infectionsmay be more vulnerable to other diseases, particularly ifsignificant liver damage has occurred. Most patients withlung fluke infections also recover, however, severe infec-tions of the brain can cause death from the destruction of"
"central nervous system or brain tissue.
Prevention
No vaccines have been developed that are effective
against lung or liver fluke infections. Prevention of theseinfections includes the following measures:
• boiling or purifying drinking water• avoiding raw or undercooked fish or salads made from
fresh aquatic plants; all food eaten in areas with flukeinfestations should be cooked thoroughly; pickling orsmoking will not kill fluke cysts in fish or shellfish
• control or eradication of the snails that serve as the
flukes’ intermediate hostsResources

Fluoroquinolones
Definition
Fluoroquinolones are medicines that kill bacteria or
prevent their growth.
Purpose
Fluoroquinolones are antibiotics , medicines used to"
"prevent their growth.
Purpose
Fluoroquinolones are antibiotics , medicines used to
treat infections caused by microorganisms. Physiciansprescribe these drugs for bacterial infections in manyparts of the body. For example, they are used to treatbone and joint infections, skin infections, urinary tractinfections, inflammation of the prostate, serious earinfections, bronchitis ,pneumonia ,tuberculosis , some
sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and some infec-
tions that affect people with AIDS .
Description
Fluoroquinolones are available only with a physi-
cian’s prescription and are sold in tablet and injectableforms. Examples of these medicines are moxifloxacin(Avelox), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), ofloxacin (Floxin), lev-ofloxacin (Levaquin), lomefloxacin (Maxaquin), nor-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1344Fluoroquinolones"
"floxacin (Noroxin), enoxacin (Penetrex), gatifloxacin
(Tequin), and sparfloxacin (Zagam).
Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type and
strength of fluoroquinolone, and the kind of infection forwhich it is being taken. Check with the physician whoprescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-scription for the correct dosage.
To make sure the infection clears up completely,
take the medicine for as long as it has been prescribed.Do not stop taking the drug just because symptoms beginto improve. Symptoms may return if the drug is stoppedtoo soon.
Fluoroquinolones work best when they are at con-"
"Fluoroquinolones work best when they are at con-
stant levels in the blood. To help keep levels constant,take the medicine in doses spaced evenly through the dayand night. Do not miss any doses. For best results, takethis medicine with a full glass of water and drink severalmore glasses throughout the day, every day during treat-ment with the drug. The extra water will help preventsome side effects. Some fluoroquinolones should betaken on an empty stomach; others may be taken withmeals. Check package directions or ask the physician orpharmacist for instructions on how to take the medicine.
Precautions
Research suggests that fluoroquinolones may cause
bone development problems in children and teenagers.Infants, children, teenagers, pregnant women, andwomen who are breastfeeding should not take this medi-cine unless directed to do so by a physician.

• loss of consciousness
Some fluoroquinolones may weaken the tendons in
the shoulder, hand, or heel, making the tendons morelikely to tear. Anyone who notices pain or inflammation
in these or other tendon areas should stop taking themedicine immediately and call a physician. Rest andavoid exercise until the physician determines whetherKEY TERMS

Folic acid
Definition
Folic acid is a water-soluable vitamin belonging to the
B-complex group of vitamins . These vitamins help the
body break down complex carbohydrates into simple sug-ars to be used for energy. Excess B vitamins are excretedfrom the body rather than stored for later use. This is whysufficient daily intake of folic acid is necessary.

"Description
Folic acid is also known as folate, or folacin. It is
one of the nutrients most often found to be deficient inthe Western diet, and there is evidence that deficiency isa problem on a worldwide scale. Folic acid is found inleafy green vegetables, beans, peas and lentils, liver,beets, brussel sprouts, poultry, nutritional yeast, tuna,wheat germ, mushrooms, oranges, asparagus, broccoli,spinach, bananas, strawberries, and cantaloupes. In 1998,the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requiredfood manufacturers to add folic acid to enriched breadand grain products to boost intake and to help preventneural tube defects (NTD).
Purpose

"Purpose
Folic acid works together with vitamin B12and vita-
min C to metabolize protein in the body. It is importantfor the formation of red and white blood cells. It is neces-sary for the proper differentiation and growth of cells andfor the development of the fetus. It is also used to formthe nucleic acid of DNA and RNA. It increases theappetite and stimulates the production of stomach acidfor digestion and it aids in maintaining a healthy liver. Adeficiency of folic acid may lead to anemia, in whichthere is decreased production of red blood cells. Thisreduces the amounts of oxygen and nutrients that are ableto get to the tissues. Symptoms may include fatigue ,
reduced secretion of digestive acids, confusion, and for-getfulness. During pregnancy , a folic acid deficiency
may lead to preeclampsia, premature birth, and increasedbleeding after birth.
People who are at high risk of strokes and heart dis-"
"People who are at high risk of strokes and heart dis-
ease may greatly benefit by taking folic acid supple-ments. An elevated blood level of the amino acid homo-cysteine has been identified as a risk factor for some ofthese diseases. High levels of homocysteine have alsobeen found to contribute to problems with osteoporosis .
Folic acid, together with vitamins B
6and B12, helps break
down homocysteine, and may help reverse the problemsassociated with elevated levels.
Pregnant women have an increased need for folic
acid, both for themselves and their child. Folic acid isnecessary for the proper growth and development of thefetus. Adequate intake of folic acid is vital for the pre-vention of several types of birth defects , particularly"
"NTDs. The neural tube of the embryo develops into thebrain, spinal cord, spinal column, and the skull. If thistube forms incompletely during the first few months ofpregnancy a serious, and often fatal, defect results inspina bifida or anencephaly. Folic acid, taken from one
year to one month before conception through the firstfour months of pregnancy, can reduce the risk of NTDsby 50–70%. It also helps prevent a cleft lip and palate .
Research shows that folic acid can be used to suc-
cessfully treat cervical dysplasia, a condition diagnosedby a Pap smear, of having abnormal cells in the cervix.This condition is considered to be a possible precursor tocervical cancer , and is diagnosed as an abnormal Pap
smear. Daily consumption of 1,000 mcg of folic acid forthree or more months has resulted in improved cervicalcells upon repeat Pap smears.
Studies suggest that long-term use of folic acid sup-
plements may also help prevent lung and colon cancer ."
"plements may also help prevent lung and colon cancer .
Researchers have also found that alcoholics who havelow folic acid levels face a greatly increased possibilityof developing colon cancer .
Preparations
To correct a folic acid deficiency, supplements are
taken in addition to food. Since the functioning of the Bvitamins is interrelated, it is generally recommended thatthe appropriate dose of B-complex vitamins be taken inplace of single B vitamin supplements. The Recom-mended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for folate is 400 mcgper day for adults, 600 mcg per day for pregnant women,and 500 mcg for nursing women. Medicinal dosages ofup to 1,000-2,000 mcg per day may be prescribed.

"Precautions
Folic acid is not stable. It is easily destroyed by
exposure to light, air, water, and cooking. Therefore, thesupplement should be stored in a dark container in acold, dry place, such as a refrigerator. Many medicationsinterfere with the body’s absorption and use of folic acid.This includes sulfa drugs, sleeping pills, estrogen, anti-convulsants, birth control pills, antacids , quinine, and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1347Folic acid"
"some antibiotics . Using large amounts of folic acid (e.g.,
over 5,000 mcg per day) can mask a vitamin B12deficien-
cy and thereby risk of irreversible nerve damage.
Side effects
At levels of 5,000 mcg or less, folic acid is generally
safe for use. Side effects are uncommon. However, largedoses may cause nausea, decreased appetite, bloating,gas, decreased ability to concentrate, and insomnia .
Large doses may also decrease the effects of phenytoin(Dilantin), a seizure medication.
Interactions
As with all B-complex vitamins, it is best to take
folic acid with the other B vitamins. Vitamin C is impor-tant to the absorption and functioning of folic acid in thebody.

Folic acid deficiency is one of the mostcommon of all vitamin deficiencies. Although it occursin both males and females, folic acid deficiency anemiamost often affects women over 30. It becomes increas-ingly common as age impedes the body’s ability toabsorb folic acid, a water-soluble vitamin that is manu-factured by intestinal bacteria and stored for a short timein the liver. Folic acid deficiency has also been implicat-

"cy, and increase by 50% when a woman is breastfeeding.
The average American diet, high in fats, sugar, and whiteflour, provides about 200 mcg of folic acid, approximate-ly the amount needed to maintain tissue stores of the sub-stance for six to nine months before a deficiency devel-ops. Most of the folic acid in foods (with the exception ofthe folic acid added to enriched flour and breakfast cere-als) occurs as folate. Folate is only about half as availablefor the body to use as is the folic acid in pills and supple-ments. Folate also is easily destroyed by sunlight, over-cooking, or the storing of foods at room temperature foran extended period of time.

"•s o y• wheat germ
Causes and symptoms
This condition usually results from a diet lacking in
foods with high folic acid content, or from the body’sinability to digest foods or absorb foods having high folicacid content. Other factors that increase the risk of devel-oping folic acid deficiency anemia are:
• age
• alcoholism• birth-control pills, anticonvulsant therapy, sulfa antibi-
otics , and certain other medications
• illness
• smoking• stress
Fatigue is often the first sign of folic acid deficiency
anemia. Other symptoms include:
• anorexia nervosa• pale skin• paranoia
• rapid heart beat
• sore, inflamed tongue
• weakness• weight loss
Diagnosis
Diagnostic procedures include blood tests to mea-
sure hemoglobin, an iron-containing compound that car-ries oxygen to cells throughout the body. Symptoms maybe reevaluated after the patient has taken prescriptionfolic acid supplements.

"Treatment
Folic acid supplements are usually prescribed, and
self-care includes avoiding:
• alcohol
• non-herbal tea, antacids , and phosphates (contained in
beer, ice cream, and soft drinks), which restrict ironabsorption
• tobacco
A person with folic acid deficiency anemia should
rest as often as necessary until restored energy levelsmake it possible to resume regular activities. A doctorshould be seen if fever , chills, muscle aches, or new
symptoms develop during treatment, or if symptoms donot improve after two weeks of treatment.
Alternative treatment
Alternative therapies for folic acid deficiency ane-
mia may include reflexology concentrated on areas that
influence the liver and spleen. Increasing consumption offoods high in folate is helpful. Eating a mixture of yogurt(8 oz) and turmeric (1 tsp) also may help resolve symp-toms. A physician should be contacted if the tonguebecomes slick or smooth or the patient:"
"• bruises or tires easily• feels ill for more than five days• feels weak or out of breath
• looks pale or jaundiced
Prognosis
Although adequate folic acid intake usually cures
this condition in about three weeks, folic acid deficiencyanemia can make patients infertile or more susceptible toinfection. Severe deficiencies can result in congestiveheart failure .

"Prevention
Eating raw or lightly cooked vegetables every day
will help maintain normal folic acid levels, as will takinga folic acid supplement containing at least 400 mcg of thisvitamin. Because folic acid deficiency can cause birthdefects, all women of childbearing age who can becomepregnant should consume at least 400 mcg of folic aciddaily; a woman who is pregnant should have regular med-ical checkups, and take a good prenatal vitamin.

"Follicle-stimulating 
hormone test
Definition
The follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test measures
the amount of FSH in the blood. FSH is a hormone thatregulates the growth and development of eggs and sperm,and this test is used to diagnose or evaluate disordersinvolving the pituitary gland and reproductive system.
Purpose
FSH testing is performed if a physician suspects the
patient may have a disorder involving the reproductivesystem or pituitary gland. The pituitary gland producesFSH, which stimulates the growth of the sacks (follicles)that surround the eggs in a woman’s ovaries. This isimportant for the process of ovulation, in which the eggis released. In men, FSH stimulates production of sperm.If there are abnormal levels of FSH in the blood it maymean that one of several disorders are present. Normalfluctuations occur as a result of puberty , the menstrual
cycle, pregnancy , and menopause .
The FSH test is performed more often on women than"
"cycle, pregnancy , and menopause .
The FSH test is performed more often on women than
on men. In women, it is used to determine if menopausehas begun, to diagnose infertility and menstrual disor-ders (such as anovulatory bleeding), to measure hormone
levels in children who enter puberty at an early age, and todiagnose other disorders. In men, it can be used to deter-mine early puberty, abnormal tissue growth on one or moreof the hormone-secreting (endocrine) glands (called multi-ple endocrine neoplasia), or to diagnose other disorders.
Description
The FSH test is a blood test. Blood will be drawn
from the patient and analyzed in a laboratory.
Preparation
In preparation for the test, there are no food or fluid"
"Preparation
In preparation for the test, there are no food or fluid
intake restrictions. Patients may be advised to discontinuecertain medications for 48 hours before the test. A men-struating woman having hot flashes or irregular periodsshould be tested on the second or third day of her menstru-al cycle. A woman who has missed a period and is havingother menopausal symptoms can be tested at any time.
Aftercare
No aftercare is necessary.
Risks
There are no risks associated with this test.
Normal results
Normal FSH test results vary according to age and
sexual maturity. The phase of a woman’s menstrual cycleor use of birth-control pills also affects test results.
For an adult male, normal results range from about
4–25 units of FSH in every liter of blood (U/L) or about5–20 micro-international units in every milliliter.
For a premenopausal woman, normal values range"
"For a premenopausal woman, normal values range
from 4–30 U/L or 5–20 micro-international units per milli-liter. In a pregnant woman, FSH levels are too low to mea-sure. After menopause, normal values range from 40–250U/L or 50–100 micro-international units per milliliter.
FSH levels fluctuate during premenopause. If no
other symptoms are present, an elevated FSH level shouldnot be interpreted as proof that menopause has begun.
Abnormal results
Anorexia nervosa and disorders of the hypothalamus
or pituitary gland can result in abnormally low FSH levels.
Abnormal levels can also indicate:

Small, yellowish-white blister-like lumps (pustules)
surrounded by narrow red rings are usually present withboth bacterial folliculitis and fungal folliculitis. Hair cangrow through or alongside of the pustules, which some-times ooze blood-stained pus.
Folliculitis can cause boils and, in rare instances,"
"Folliculitis can cause boils and, in rare instances,
serious skin infections. Bacteria from folliculitis can enterthe blood stream and travel to other parts of the body.
Causes and symptoms
Folliculitis develops when bacteria, such as Staphy-
lococcus, or a fungus enters the body through a cut,
scrape, surgical incision, or other break in the skin near ahair follicle. Scratching the affected area can trap fungusor bacteria under the fingernails and spread the infectionto hair follicles on other parts of the body.
The bacteria that cause folliculitis are contagious. A
person who has folliculitis can infect others who live inthe same household.
Factors that increase the risk of developing folliculi-
tis include:
• dermatitis
• diabetes
• dirty, crowded living conditions
• eczema
• exposure to hot, humid temperatures
• infection in the nose or other recent illness
• tight clothing

"• tight clothing
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on the patient’s medical history
and observations. Laboratory analysis of the substancedrained from a pustule can be used to distinguish bacteri-al folliculitis from fungal folliculitis.
Treatment
Bacterial folliculitis may disappear without treat-
ment, but is likely to recur. Non-prescription topicalantibiotics like Bacitracin, Mycitracin, or Neomycin,
gently rubbed on to affected areas three or four times aday, can clear up a small number of bacterial folliculitispustules. Oral antibiotics such as erythromycin (Ery-

Daily doses of 30–50 mg zinc and 1,000–5,000 mg
Vitamin C (taken in equal amounts at several times dur-ing the day), and 300–2,000 mg bioflavinoids can alsostrengthen the body’s infection-fighting ability. Highdoses of vitamins and minerals should not be used with-
out a doctor’s approval.
Prognosis
If properly treated, the symptoms of bacterial folli-

"Prevention
Anyone who has a tendency to develop folliculitis
should cleanse the skin with antibacterial soap twice aday and before shaving and should not use oily skinlotions. Men should not shave while the beard area isinfected. When they begin shaving again, they should usea new blade each time. Women who have had fungal fol-liculitis should use depilatory creams instead of razors.Daily shampooing can help prevent folliculitis in thescalp. The spread of infection can be prevented by notsharing towels or washcloths

Food poisoning
Definition
Food poisoning is a general term for health prob-
lems arising from eating contaminated food. Food maybe contaminated by bacteria, viruses, environmental tox-ins, or toxins present within the food itself, such as thepoisons in some mushrooms or certain seafood. Symp-toms of food poisoning usually involve nausea, vomiting

"and/or diarrhea . Some food-borne toxins can affect the
nervous system.
Description
Every year millions of people suffer from bouts of
vomiting and diarrhea each year that they blame on“something I ate.” These people are generally correct.Each year in the United States, one to two bouts of diar-rheal illness occur in every adult. The Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there arefrom six to 33 million cases of food poisoning in the Unit-ed States annually. Many cases are mild and pass so rapid-ly that they are never diagnosed. Occasionally a severeoutbreak creates a newsworthy public health hazard.
Classical food poisoning, sometimes incorrectly
called ptomaine poisoning, is caused by a variety of dif-ferent bacteria. The most common are Salmonella ,
Staphylococcus aureus ,Escherichia coli O157:H7 or
other E. coli strains, Shigella , and Clostridium
botulinum . Each has a slightly different incubation peri-
od and duration, but all except C. botulinum cause"
"od and duration, but all except C. botulinum cause
inflammation of the intestines and diarrhea. Sometimesfood poisoning is called bacterial gastroenteritis or
infectious diarrhea. Food and water can also be contami-nated by viruses (such as the Norwalk agent that causesdiarrhea and the viruses of hepatitis A and E), environ-
mental toxins (heavy metals), and poisons producedwithin the food itself ( mushroom poisoning or fish and
shellfish poisoning ).
Careless food handling during the trip from farm to
table creates conditions for the growth of bacteria thatmake people sick. Vegetables that are eaten raw, such as let-tuce, may be contaminated by bacteria in soil, water, anddust during washing and packing. Home canned and com-mercially canned food may be improperly processed at toolow a temperature or for too short a time to kill the bacteria.
Raw meats carry many food-borne bacterial dis-"
"Raw meats carry many food-borne bacterial dis-
eases. The United States Food and Drug Administration(FDA) estimates that 60% or more of raw poultry sold atretail carry some disease-causing bacteria. Other rawmeat products and eggs are contaminated to a lesserdegree. Thorough cooking kills the bacteria and makesthe food harmless. However, properly cooked food canbecome re-contaminated if it comes in contact withplates, cutting boards, countertops, or utensils that wereused with raw meat and not cleaned and sanitized.
Cooked foods can also be contaminated after cook-
ing by bacteria carried by food handlers or from bacteriain the environment. It is estimated that 50% of healthypeople have the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus in their
nasal passages and throat, and on their skin and hair.Rubbing a runny nose, then touching food can introducethe bacteria into cooked food. Bacteria flourish at room"
"temperature, and will rapidly grow into quantities capa-ble of making people sick. To prevent this growth, foodmust be kept hot or cold, but never just warm.
Although the food supply in the United States is
probably the safest in the world, anyone can get foodpoisoning. Serious outbreaks are rare. When they occur,the very young, the very old, and those with immune sys-tem weaknesses have the most severe and life-threaten-ing cases. For example, this group is 20 times more like-ly to become infected with the Salmonella bacteria than
the general population.
Travel outside the United States to countries where
less attention is paid to sanitation, water purification, andgood food handling practices increases the chances that aperson will get food poisoning. People living in institu-tions such as nursing homes are also more likely to getfood poisoning.
Causes and symptoms

"Causes and symptoms
The symptoms of food poisoning occur because
food-borne bacteria release toxins or poisons as abyproduct of their growth in the body. These toxins(except those from C. botulinum ) cause inflammation
and swelling of the stomach, small intestine and/or largeintestine. The result is abdominal muscle cramping,vomiting, diarrhea, fever , and the chance of dehydra-
tion. The severity of symptoms depends on the type of
bacteria, the amount consumed, and the individual’s gen-eral health and sensitivity to the bacterial toxin.
Salmonella
According to a 2001 report from the CDC, Salmo-
nella caused almost 50,000 culture-confirmed cases of
food poisoning in the United States annually. However,between two and four million probably occur each year.Salmonella is found in egg yolks from infected chickens,"
"in raw and undercooked poultry and in other meats, dairyproducts, fish, shrimp, and many more foods. The CDCestimates that one out of every 50 consumers is exposedto a contaminated egg yolk each year. However, thoroughcooking kills the bacteria and makes the food harmless.Salmonella is also found in the feces of pet reptiles such
as turtles, lizards, and snakes.
About one out of every 1,000 people get food poi-
soning from Salmonella . Of these, two-thirds are under
age 20, with the majority under age nine. Most casesoccur in the warm months between July and October.
Symptoms of food poisoning begin eight to 72 hours
after eating food contaminated with Salmonella . These
include traditional food poisoning symptoms of abdomi-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1353Food poisoning"
"nal pain , diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. The symptoms
generally last one to five days. Dehydration can be acomplication in severe cases. People generally recoverwithout antibiotic treatment, although they may feel tiredfor a week after the active symptoms subside.
Staphylococcus aureus
Staphylococcus aureus is found on humans and in
the environment in dust, air, and sewage. The bacteria isspread primarily by food handlers using poor sanitarypractices. Almost any food can be contaminated, butsalad dressings, milk products, cream pastries, and anyfood kept at room temperature, rather than hot or cold arelikely candidates.
It is difficult to estimate the number of cases of food
poisoning from Staphylococcus aureus that occur each
year, because its symptoms are so similar to those causedby other foodborne bacteria. Many cases are mild and thevictim never sees a doctor.
Symptoms appear rapidly, usually one to six hours"
"Symptoms appear rapidly, usually one to six hours
after the contaminated food is eaten. The acute symp-toms of vomiting and severe abdominal cramps withoutfever usually last only three to six hours and rarely morethan 24 hours. Most people recover without medicalassistance. Deaths are rare.
Escherichia coli (E. coli)
There are many strains of E. coli , and not all of them
are harmful. The strain that causes most severe food poi-soning is E. coli O157:H7 . Food poisoning by E. coli
occurs in three out of every 10,000 people. Foodborne E.
coliis found and transmitted mainly in food derived from
cows such as raw milk, raw or rare ground beef and fruitor vegetables that are contaminated.
Symptoms of food poisoning from E. coli are slower
to appear than those caused by some of the other food-borne bacteria. E. coli produces toxins in the large intes-"
"tine rather than higher up in the digestive system. Thisaccounts for the delay in symptoms and the fact thatvomiting rarely occurs in E. coli food poisoning.
One to three days after eating contaminated food, the
victim with E. coli O157:H7 begins to have severe abdom-
inal cramps and watery diarrhea that usually becomesbloody within 24 hours. There is little or no fever, andrarely does the victim vomit. The bloody, watery diarrhealasts from one to eight days in uncomplicated cases.
Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni)
According to the FDA, C. jejuni is the leading cause of
bacterial diarrhea in the United States. It is responsible formore cases of bacterial diarrhea than Shigella and Salmo-nella combined. Anyone can get food poisoning from C.
jejuni , but children under five and young adults between
the ages of 15 and 29 are more frequently infected.
C. jejuni is carried by healthy cattle, chickens, birds,"
"C. jejuni is carried by healthy cattle, chickens, birds,
and flies. It is not carried by healthy people in the UnitedStates or Europe. The bacteria is also found ponds andstream water. The ingestion of only a few hundred C.
jejuni bacteria can make a person sick.
Symptoms of food poisoning begin two to five days
after eating food contaminated with C. jejuni . These
symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, nausea,headache , muscle pain, and diarrhea. The diarrhea can
be watery or sticky and may contain blood. Symptomslast from seven to 10 days, and relapses occur in aboutone quarter of people who are infected. Dehydration is acommon complication. Other complications such asarthritis-like joint pain and hemolytic-uremic syndrome
(HUS) are rare.
Shigella
Shigella is a common cause of diarrhea in travelers
to developing countries. It is associated with contaminat-ed food and water, crowded living conditions, and poorsanitation. The bacterial toxins affect the small intestine."
"Symptoms of food poisoning by Shigella appear
36–72 hours after eating contaminated food. These symp-toms are slightly different from those associated with mostfoodborne bacteria. In addition to the familiar watery diar-rhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, chills and feveroccur. The diarrhea may be quite severe with cramps pro-gressing to classical dysentery. Up to 40% of children withsevere infections show neurological symptoms. Theseinclude seizures caused by fever, confusion, headache,lethargy, and a stiff neck that resembles meningitis .
The disease runs its course usually in two to three
days but may last longer. Dehydration is a common com-plication. Most people recover on their own, althoughthey may feel exhausted, but children who are malnour-ished or have weakened immune systems may die.

"Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum)
C. botulinum , which causes both adult botulism and
infant botulism, is unlike any of the other foodborne bac-teria. First, C. botulinum is an anaerobic bacterium in
that it can only live in the absence of oxygen. Second, thetoxins from C. botulinum are neurotoxins. They poison
the nervous system, causing paralysis without the vomit-
ing and diarrhea associated with other foodborne illness-es. Third, toxins that cause adult botulism are releasedwhen the bacteria grows in an airless environment out-side the body. They can be broken down and made harm-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1354Food poisoning"
"less by heat. Finally, botulism is much more likely to be
fatal even in tiny quantities.
Adult botulism outbreaks are usually associated
with home canned food, although occasionally commer-cially canned or vacuum packed foods are responsiblefor the disease. C. botulinum grows well in non-acidic,
oxygen-free environments. If food is canned at too lowheat or for too brief a time, the bacteria is not killed. Itreproduces inside the can or jar, releasing its deadly neu-rotoxin. The toxin can be made harmless by heating thecontaminated food to boiling for ten minutes. However,even a very small amount of the C. botulinum toxin can
cause serious illness or death .
Symptoms of adult botulism appear about 18–36
hours after the contaminated food is eaten, althoughthere are documented times of onset ranging from fourhours to eight days. Initially a person suffering from bot-ulism feels weakness and dizziness followed by double"
"vision. Symptoms progress to difficulty speaking andswallowing. Paralysis moves down the body, and whenthe respiratory muscles are paralyzed, death results fromasphyxiation. People who show any signs of botulismpoisoning must receive immediate emergency medicalcare to increase their chance of survival.
Infant botulism is a form of botulism first recog-
nized in 1976. It differs from food-borne botulism in itscauses and symptoms. Infant botulism occurs when achild under the age of one year ingests the spores of C.
botulinum . These spores are found in soil, but a more
common source of spores is honey.

"common source of spores is honey.
The C. botulinum spores lodge in the baby’s intesti-
nal tract and begin to grow, producing their neurotoxin.Onset of symptoms is gradual. Initially the baby is consti-pated. This is followed by poor feeding, lethargy, weak-ness, drooling, and a distinctive wailing cry. Eventually,the baby loses the ability to control its head muscles.From there the paralysis progresses to the rest of the body.
Diagnosis
One important aspect of diagnosing food poisoning
is for doctors to determine if a number of people haveeaten the same food and show the same symptoms of ill-ness. When this happens, food poisoning is strongly sus-pected. The diagnosis is confirmed when the suspectedbacteria is found in a stool culture or a fecal smear from"
"the person. Other laboratory tests are used to isolate bac-teria from a sample of the contaminated food. Botulismis usually diagnosed from its distinctive neurologicalsymptoms, since rapid treatment is essential. Many casesof food poisoning go undiagnosed, since a definite diag-nosis is not necessary to effectively treat the symptoms.Because it takes time for symptoms to develop, it is notnecessarily the most recent food one has eaten that is the
cause of the symptoms.
Treatment
Treatment of food poisoning, except that caused by
C. botulinum, focuses on preventing dehydration by
replacing fluids and electrolytes lost through vomitingand diarrhea. Electrolytes are salts and minerals that"
"form electrically charges particles (ions) in body fluids.Electrolytes are important because they control bodyfluid balance and are important for all major body reac-tions. Pharmacists can recommend effective, pleasant-tasting, electrolytically balanced replacement fluidsthat are available without a prescription. When morefluids are being lost than can be consumed, dehydrationmay occur. Dehydration more likely to happen in thevery young, the elderly, and people who are takingdiuretics . To prevent dehydration, a doctor may give
fluids intravenously.
In very serious cases of food poisoning, medications
may be given to stop abdominal cramping and vomiting.Anti-diarrheal medications are not usually given. Stop-ping the diarrhea keeps the toxins in the body longer andmay prolong the infection.
People with food poisoning should modify their diet."
"People with food poisoning should modify their diet.
During period of active vomiting and diarrhea theyshould not try to eat and should drink only clear liquidsfrequently but in small quantities. Once active symptomsstop, they should eat bland, soft, easy to digest foods fortwo to three days. One example is the BRAT diet ofbananas, rice, applesauce, and toast, all of which are easyto digest. Milk products, spicy food, alcohol and freshfruit should be avoided for a few days, although babiesshould continue to breastfeed. These modifications areoften all the treatment that is necessary.

treated with antibiotics . Trimethoprim and sulfamethox-

Botulism is treated in a different way from other
bacterial food poisonings. Botulism antitoxin is given toadults, but not infants, if it can be administered within 72hours after symptoms are first observed. If given later, itprovides no benefit.
Both infants and adults require hospitalization, often
in the intensive care unit. If the ability to breathe isimpaired, patients are put on a mechanical ventilator toassist their breathing and are fed intravenously until theparalysis passes.
Alternative treatment

tional practitioners concerning diet modification. In addi-tion they recommend taking charcoal tablets, Lactobacillus

extract. An electrolyte replacement fluid can be made athome by adding one teaspoon of salt and four teaspoons ofsugar to one quart of water. For food poisoning other thanbotulism, two homeopathic remedies, either Arsenicum
album or Nux vomica , are strongly recommended.
Prognosis
Most cases of food poisoning (except botulism)
clear up on their own within one week without medicalassistance. The ill person may continue feel tired for afew days after active symptoms stop. So long as the illperson does not become dehydrated, there are few com-plications. Deaths are rare and usually occur in the veryKEY TERMS

Foot care
Definition
Foot care involves all aspects of preventative and
corrective care of the foot and ankle. Doctors specializ-ing in foot care are called podiatrists.
Purpose
During an average lifetime, each person walks about
115,000 miles and three-quarters of people have footproblems at some point in their lives.
Foot problems can arise from wearing ill-fitting
shoes, from general wear and tear, as a result of injury, oras a complication of disease. People with diabetes melli-
tusor circulatory diseases are 20 times more likely to
have foot problems than the general public.
Podiatrists are doctors who specialize in treating the"
"have foot problems than the general public.
Podiatrists are doctors who specialize in treating the
foot and ankle. Other doctors who have experience withfoot problems are family physicians, orthopedists, sportsmedicine specialists, and those who care for diabetics.Problems with the feet include foot pain , joint inflamma-
tion, plantar warts , fungal infections (like athlete’s
foot), nerve disorders, torn ligaments, broken bones, bac-
terial infections, and tissue injuries (like frostbite).
Precautions
People with diabetes or circulatory disorders should
be alert to even small foot problems. In these people, abreak in the skin can lead to infection, gangrene , and
amputation .

"amputation .
Description
Daily foot care for people likely to develop foot
problems includes washing the feet in tepid water withmild soap and oiling the feet with vegetable oil or a lano-lin-based lotion. Toenails should be cut straight acrossabove the level of the skin after soaking the feet in tepidwater. Corns and calluses should not be cut. If they need
removal, it should be done under the care of a doctor.Athletes foot and plantar warts should also be treated bya doctor if they develop in high risk patients.Many people with diabetes or circulatory disorders
have problems with cold feet. These problems can bereduced by avoiding smoking tobacco (smoking con-
stricts the blood vessels), wearing warm socks, not cross-ing the legs while sitting or not sitting in one position toolong, or avoiding constricting stockings.
People with circulatory problems should not use heat-"
"People with circulatory problems should not use heat-
ing pads or hot water bottles on their feet, as even moder-ate heat can damage the skin if circulation is impaired.
Preparation
No special preparation other than an understanding
of the nature of foot problems is necessary to begin rou-tine foot care.
Aftercare
Foot care is preventative and should be ongoing
throughout a person’s life.
Risks
There are no risks associated with foot care. The risks
are in ignoring the feet and allowing problems to develop.
Normal results
With regular care, foot disorders such as infections,
skin ulcers, and gangrene can be prevented.

“Foreign” means “originating elsewhere” or simply
“outside the body.” Foreign bodies typically become
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1357Foreign objects"
"lodged in the eyes, ears, nose, airways, and rectum of
human beings.
Description
Both children and adults experience problems
caused by foreign objects getting stuck in their bodies.Young children, in particular, are naturally curious andmay intentionally put shiny objects, such as coins orbutton batteries, into their mouths. They also like tostick things in their ears and up their noses. Adults mayaccidentally swallow a non-food object or inhale a for-eign body that gets stuck in the throat. Even if an objectlike a toothpick successfully passes through the esopha-gus and into the stomach, it can get stuck inside the rec-tum. Airborne particles can lodge in the eyes of peopleat any age.
Foreign bodies can be in hollow organs (like swal-
lowed batteries) or in tissues (like bullets). They can beinert or irritating. If they irritate they will cause inflam-mation and scarring. They can bring infection with them"
"or acquire it and protect it from the body’s immunedefenses. They can obstruct passageways either by theirsize or by the scarring they cause. Some can be toxic.
Causes and symptoms
Eyes
Dust, dirt, sand, or other airborne material can lodge
in the eyes, causing minor irritation and redness. Moreserious damage can be caused by hard or sharp objectsthat penetrate the surface and become embedded in thecornea or conjunctiva (the mucous membranes aroundthe inner surface of the eyelids). Swelling, redness,bleeding from the surface blood vessels, sensitivity tolight, and sudden vision problems are all symptoms offoreign matter in the eyes.
Ears and nose
Children will sometimes put things into their noses,
ears, and other openings. Beans, popcorn kernels, raisins,and beads are just a few of the many items that have beenfound in these bodily cavities. On occasion, insects mayalso fly into the ears and nose. Pain ,hearing loss , and a"
"sense of something stuck in the ear are symptoms of for-eign bodies in the ears. A smelly, bloody discharge fromone nostril is a symptom of foreign bodies in the nose.
Airways and stomach
At a certain age children will eat anything. A very
partial list of items recovered from young stomachsincludes the following: Coins, chicken bones, fish bones,beads, rocks, plastic toys, pins, keys, round stones, mar-bles, nails, rings, batteries, ball bearings, screws, staples,washers, a heart pendant, a clothespin spring, and a toysoldier. Some of these items will pass right on throughand come out the other end. The progress of metal objectshas been successfully followed with a metal detector.Others, like sharp bones, can get stuck and cause trouble.Batteries are corrosive and must be removed immediately.
Children eat things and stick things into their bodily"
"Children eat things and stick things into their bodily
openings of their own volition. But they inhale themunwittingly. The most commonly inhaled item is probablya peanut. A crayon and a cockroach have been found in achild’s windpipes. These items always cause symptoms(difficulty swallowing and spitting up saliva, for instance)and may elude detection for some time while the child isbeing treated for asthma or recurring pneumonia .
Adults are not exempt from unorthodox inedibles.
Dental devices are commonly swallowed. Adults withmental illness or subversive motives may swallow inap-propriate objects, such as toothbrushes.

"Rectum
Sometimes a foreign object will successfully pass
throught the throat and stomach only to get stuck at thejuncture between the rectum and the anal canal. Itemsmay also be self-introduced to enhance sexual stimula-tion and then get stuck. Sudden sharp pain during elimi-nation may signify that an object is lodged in the rectum.Other symptoms vary depending upon the size of theobject, its location, how long it has been in place, andwhether or not infection has set in.
Diagnosis
The symptoms are as diverse as the objects and their
locations. The most common manifestation of a foreignobject anywhere in the body is infection. Even if theobject started out sterile, germs still seem to find it andare able to hide from the body’s defenses there. Blockageof passageways—breathing, digestive or excretory—isanother result. Pain is common.

"Treatment
Eyes
Small particles like sand may be removable without
medical help, but if the object is not visible or cannot beretrieved, prompt emergency treatment is necessary.Trauma to the eyes can lead to loss of vision and shouldnever be ignored. Before attempting any treatment, theperson should move to a well-lighted area where theobject can be more easily spotted. Hands should bewashed and only clean, preferably sterile, materialsshould make contact with the eyes. If the particle issmall, it can be dislodged by blinking or pulling theupper lid over the lower lid and flushing out the speck. Aclean cloth can also be used to pick out the offendingparticle. Afterwards, the eye should be rinsed with clean,lukewarm water or an opthalmic wash.

"If the foreign object cannot be removed at home, the
eye should be lightly covered with sterile gauze to dis-courage rubbing. A physician will use a strong light andpossibly special eyedrops to locate the object. Surgicaltweezers can effectively remove many objects. Anantibiotic sterile ointment and a patch may be pre-scribed. If the foreign body has penetrated the deeperlayers of the eye, an opthalmic surgeon will be consultedfor emergency treatment.

been devised for removing foreign objects from the noseand ears. A bead in a nostril, for example, can be poppedKEY TERMS

monly occurs when food gets lodged in the throat, can betreated by applying the Heimlich maneuver . If the object"
"is lodged lower in the airway, a bronchoscope (a specialinstrument to view the airway and remove obstructions)can be inserted. On other occasions, as when the object isblocking the entrance to the stomach, a fiberoptic endo-scope (an illuminated instrument that views the interior ofa body cavity) may be used. The physician typicallyadministers a sedative and anesthetizes the throat. Theforeign object will then either be pulled out or pushed intothe stomach, depending on whether or not the physician

Using common sense and following safety precau-

For instance, parents and grandparentsshould toddler-proof their homes, storing batteries in alocked cabinet and properly disposing of used batteries,so they are not in a location where curious preschoolerscan fish them out of a wastebasket. To minimize thechance of youngsters inhaling food, parents should notallow children to eat while walking or playing. Adultsshould chew food thoroughly and not talk while chew-ing. Many eye injuries can be prevented by wearing safe-ty glasses while using tools

"Fracture repair
Definition
Fracture repair is the process of rejoining and
realigning the ends of broken bones. This procedure isusually performed by an orthopedist, general surgeon, orfamily doctor. In cases of an emergency, first aid mea-sures should be evoked for temporary realignment andimmobilization until proper medical help is available.
Purpose
Fracture repair is required when there is a need for
restoration of the normal position and function of the bro-ken bone. Throughout the stages of fracture healing, thebones must be held firmly in the correct position. In theevent the fracture is not properly repaired, malalignmentof the bone may occur, resulting in possible physical dys-function of the bone or joint of that region of the body.

"Precautions
Precautions for fracture repair are anything found to
be significant with patients’ medical diagnosis and histo-ry. This would include an individual’s tolerance to anes-thesia and the presence of bleeding disorders that may bepresent to complicate surgery.
Description
Fracture repair is applied by means of traction ,
surgery, and/or by immobilization of the bones. The bonefragments are aligned as close as possible to the normalposition without injuring the skin. Metal wires or screwsmay be needed to align smaller bone fragments. Once the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1360Fracture repair"
"broken ends of the bone are set, the affected area is
immobilized for several weeks and kept rigid with asling, plaster cast, brace or splint. With the use of trac-tion, muscle pull on the fracture site is overcome byweights attached to a series of ropes running over pul-leys. Strategically implanted electrical stimulationdevices have proven beneficial in healing a fracture site,especially when the fracture is healing poorly and repairby other means is difficult.
Preparation
Emergency splinting may be required to immobilize
the body part or parts involved. When fracture repair isnecessary, the procedure is often performed in a hospitalbut can also be successfully done in an outpatient surgi-cal facility, doctor’s office or emergency room. Beforeany surgery for fracture repair, blood and urine studiesmay be taken from the patient. X rays may follow this ifnot previously acquired. It has been noted however, thatnot all fractures are immediately apparent on an initial"
"x-ray examination. In this case, where a fracture is defi-nitely suspected the extent of the fracture can be properlydiagnosed by repeating the x rays 10–14 days later.Depending upon the situation, local or general anesthesiamay be used for fracture repair.
Aftercare

"Aftercare
After surgery, x rays may be again taken through the
cast or splint to evaluate if rejoined pieces remain in goodposition for healing. This is usually performed either beforethe application of the splint or at least before the patient isawakened from the general anesthesia. The patient needs tobe cautious not to place excess pressure on any part of thecast until it is completely dry. The patient also should avoidexcess pressure on the operative site until complete healinghas taken place and the injury has been re-examined by thephysician. If the cast becomes exposed to moisture it maysoften and require repair. The patient should also beinstructed to keep the injured region propped up wheneverpossible to reduce the possibility of swelling.
Risks
Surgical risks of fracture repair are greater in
patients over 60 years of age because the bones often tak-ing longer to heal properly. Obesity may place extra
stress on the healing site, affecting healing and possibly"
"stress on the healing site, affecting healing and possibly
risking reinjury. Smoking may slow the healing process
after fracture repair, as well as poor nutrition ,alco-
holism , and chronic illness. Some medications may
affect the fracture site, causing poor union. Such medica-tions include anti-hypertensives and cortisone.Possible complications following fracture repair"
"include excessive bleeding, improper fit of joined boneends, pressure on nearby nerves, delayed healing, and apermanent incomplete healing of the fracture. If there isa poor blood supply to the fractured site with one of theportions of broken bone not properly supplied by theblood, the bony portion will die and healing of the frac-ture will not take place. This is called aseptic necrosis.Poor immobilization of the fracture from improper cast-ing which permits motion between the bone parts mayprevent healing and repair of the bone with possibledeformity. Infection can interfere with bone repair. Thisrisk is greater in the case of a compound fracture (a bonefracture causing an open wound) where ideal conditionsare present for severe streptococcal and staphylococcal
infections . Occasionally, fractured bones in the elderly
may possibly never heal properly. The risk is increasedwhen nutrition is poor.

"Normal results
Once the procedure for fracture repair is completed,
the body begins to produce new tissue to bridge the bro-ken pieces. At first, this tissue (called a callus) is soft andeasily injured. Later, the body deposits bone minerals
until the callus becomes a solid piece of bone. The frac-ture site is thus strengthened further with extra bone. Itusually takes about six weeks for a broken bone to healtogether. The exact time required for healing depends onthe type of fracture and the extent of damage. Before theuse of x rays, fracture repair was not always accurate,resulting in crippling deformities. With modern x-raytechnology, the physician can view the extent of the frac-ture, check the setting following the repair, and be certainafter the procedure that the bones have not moved fromtheir intended alignment. Children’s bones usually healrelatively rapidly.

"A fracture usually results from traumatic injury to
bones causing the continuity of bone tissues or bony carti-lage to be disrupted or broken. Fracture classificationsinclude simple, compound, incomplete and complete.Simple fractures (more recently called “closed”) are notobvious as the skin has not been ruptured and remainsintact. Compound fractures (now commonly called“open”) break the skin, exposing bone and causing addi-tional soft tissue injury and possible infection. A singlefracture means that one fracture only has occurred andmultiple fractures refer to more than one fracture occur-ring in the same bone. Fractures are termed complete ifthe break is completely through the bone and described asincomplete or “greenstick” if the fracture occurs partlyacross a bone shaft. This latter type of fracture is often theresult of bending or crushing forces applied to a bone.

"Fractures are also named according to the specific
part of the bone involved and the nature of the break.Identification of a fracture line can further classify frac-tures. Types include linear, oblique, transverse, longitu-dinal, and spiral fractures. Fractures can be further subdi-vided by the positions of bony fragments and aredescribed as comminuted, non-displaced, impacted,overriding, angulated, displaced, avulsed, and segmental.Additionally, an injury may be classified as a fracture-dislocation when a fracture involves the bony structuresof any joint with associated dislocation of the same joint.

"Fractures line identification
Linear fractures have a break that runs parallel to the
bone’s main axis or in the direction of the bone’s shaft.For example, a linear fracture of the arm bone couldextend the entire length of the bone. Oblique and trans-verse fractures differ in that an oblique fracture crosses abone at approximately a 45° angle to the bone’s axis. Incontrast, a transverse fracture crosses a bone’s axis at a90° angle. A longitudinal fracture is similar to a linearfracture. Its fracture line extends along the shaft but ismore irregular in shape and does not run parallel to thebone’s axis. Spiral fractures are described as crossing abone at an oblique angle, creating a spiral pattern. Thisbreak usually occurs in the long bones of the body such asthe upper arm bone (humerus) or the thigh bone (femur).

"Bony fragment position identification
Comminuted fractures have two or more fragments
broken into small pieces, in addition to the upper andlower halves of a fractured bone. Fragments of bone thatmaintain their normal alignment following a fracture aredescribed as being non-displaced. An impacted fractureis characterized as a bone fragment forced into or onto

"another fragment resulting from a compressive force.
Overriding is a term used to describe bony fragmentsthat overlap and shorten the total length of a bone.Angulated fragments result in pieces of bone being atangles to each other. A displaced bony fragment occursfrom disruption of normal bone alignment with deformi-ty of these segments separate from one another. Anavulsed fragment occurs when bone fragments arepulled from their normal position by forceful musclecontractions or resistance from ligaments. Segmentalfragmented positioning occurs if fractures in two adja-cent areas occur, leaving an isolated central segment. Anexample of segmental alignment is when the arm bonefractures in two separate places, with displacement ofthe middle section of bone.

"Causes and symptoms
Individuals with high activity levels appear to be at
greater risk for fractures. This group includes childrenand athletes participating in contact sports. Because of anincrease in bone brittleness with aging , elderly persons
are also included in this high-risk population. Up to theage of 50, more men suffer from fractures than women
due to occupational hazards. However, after the age of50, women are more prone to fractures than men. Specif-ic diseases causing an increased risk for fractures includePaget’s disease, rickets, osteogenesis imperfecta ,osteo-
porosis , bone cancer and tumors, and prolonged disuse
of a nonfunctional body part such as after a stroke .

"tory and physical exam by a physician often reveals the
presence of a fracture. An x ray of the injured area is themost common test used to determine the presence of abone fracture. Any x ray series performed involves atleast two views of the area to confirm the presence of thefracture because not all fractures are apparent on a singlex-ray. Some fractures are often difficult to see and mayrequire several views at different angles to see clear frac-ture lines. In some cases, CT, MRI or other imaging testsare required to demonstrate fracture. Sometimes, espe-cially with children, the initial x ray may not show anyfractures but repeat x rays seven to 14 days later mayshow changes in the bone(s) of the affected area. If afracture is open and occurs in conjunction with soft tis-sue injury, further laboratory studies are often conductedto determine if blood loss has occurred.

"Osteogenesis imperfecta —A genetic disorder
involving defective development of connective tis-sues, characterized by brittle and fragile bones thatare easily fractured by the slightest trauma.
Osteoporosis —Literally meaning “porous bones,”

"a metal instrument with a stem and two prongs that
vibrate when struck. If an individual has increased painwhen the tuning fork is placed on a bone, such as thetibia or shinbone, the likelihood of a stress fracture ishigh. Bone scans also are helpful in detecting stress frac-tures. In this diagnostic procedure, a radioactive tracer isinjected into the bloodstream and images are taken ofspecific areas or the entire skeleton by CT or MRI.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the type of fracture, its severi-
ty, the individual’s age and general health. The first prior-ity in treating any fracture is to address the entire medicalstatus of the patient. Medical personnel are trained notallow a painful, deformed limb to distract them frompotentially life-threatening injury elsewhere or shock . If
an open fracture is accompanied by serious soft tissueinjury, it may be necessary to control bleeding and theshock that can accompany loss of blood.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1364Fractures"
"First aid is the appropriate initial treatment in emer-
gency situations. It includes proper splinting, control ofblood loss, and monitoring vital signs such as breathingand circulation.
Immobilization
Immobilization of a fracture site can be done inter-
nally or externally. The primary goal of immobilizationis to maintain the realignment of a bone long enough forhealing to start and progress. Immobilization by externalfixation uses splints, casts, or braces. This may be theprimary and only procedure for fracture treatment.Splinting to immobilize a fracture can be done with orwithout traction . In emergency situations if the injured"
"individual must be moved by someone other than atrained medical person, splinting is a useful form of frac-ture management. It should be done without causingadditional pain and without moving the bone segments.In a clinical environment, plaster of Paris casts are usedfor immobilization. Braces are useful as they often allowmovement above and below a fracture site. Treatmentsfor stress fractures include rest and decreasing or stop-ping any activity that causes or increases pain.
Fracture reduction
Fracture reduction is the procedure by which a frac-
tured bone is realigned in normal position. It can beeither closed or open. Closed reduction refers to realign-ing bones without breaking the skin. It is performed withmanual manipulation and/or traction and is commonlydone with some kind of anesthetic. Open reduction pri-marily refers to surgery that is performed to realignbones or fragments. Fractures with little or no displace-ment may not require any form of reduction."
"Traction is used to help reposition a broken bone. It
works by applying pressure to restore proper alignment.The traction device immobilizes the area and maintainsrealignment as the bone heals. A fractured bone is immo-bilized by applying opposing force at both ends of theinjured area, using an equal amount of traction and coun-tertraction. Weights provide the traction pull needed orthe pull is achieved by positioning the individual’s bodyweight appropriately. Traction is a form of closed reduc-tion and is sometimes used as an alternative to surgery.Since it restricts movement of the affected limb or bodypart, it may confine a person to bed rest for an extendedperiod of time.
A person may need open reduction if there is an open,"
"A person may need open reduction if there is an open,
severe, or comminuted fracture. This procedure allows aphysician to examine and surgically correct associated softtissue damage while reducing the fracture and, if neces-sary, applying internal or external devices. Internal fixa-tion involves the use of metallic devices inserted into or
through bone to hold the fracture in a set position andalignment while it heals. Devices include plates, nails,screws, and rods. When healing is complete, the surgeonmay or may not remove these devices. Virtually any hipfracture requires open reduction and internal fixation sothat the bone will be able to support the patient’s weight.
Alternative treatment

"Alternative treatment
In addition to the importance of calcium for strong
bones, many alternative treatment approaches recom-mend use of mineral supplements to help build and main-tain a healthy, resilient skeleton. Some physical thera-pists use electro-stimulation over a fractured site to pro-mote and expedite healing. Chinese traditional medicinemay be helpful by working to reconnect chi through themeridian lines along the line of a fracture. Homeopathy
can enhance the body’s healing process. Two particularlyuseful homeopathic remedies are Arnica (Arnica mon-
tana) and Symphytum (Symphytum officinalis ). If possi-
ble, applying contrast hydrotherapy to an extremity
(e.g., a hand or foot) of a fractured area can assist healingby enhancing circulation.
Prognosis
Fractures involving joint surfaces almost always lead"
"to some degree of arthritis of the joint. Fractures can nor-mally be cured with proper first aid and appropriate after-care. If determined necessary by a physician, the frac-tured site should be manipulated, realigned, and immobi-lized as soon as possible. Realignment has been shown tobe much more difficult after six hours. Healing timevaries from person to person with the elderly generallyneeding more time to heal completely. A non-union frac-ture may result when a fracture does not heal, such as inthe case of an elderly person or an individual with med-ical complications. Recovery is complete when there is nobone motion at the fracture site, and x rays indicate com-plete healing. Open fractures may lead to bone infections,which delay the healing process. Another possible com-plication is compartment syndrome, a painful conditionresulting from the expansion of enclosed tissue and thatmay occur when a body part is immobilized in a cast.
Prevention"
"Prevention
Adequate calcium intake is necessary for strong
bones and can help decrease the risk of fractures. Peoplewho do not get enough calcium in their diets can take a
calcium supplement. Exercise can help strengthen bones
by increasing bone density, thereby decreasing the risk offractures from falls. A University of Southern Californiastudy reported that older people who exercised one or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1365Fractures"
"more hours per day had approximately half the incidence
of hip fractures as those who exercised fewer than 30minutes per day or not at all.
Fractures can be prevented if safety measures are
taken seriously. These measures include using seat beltsin cars and encouraging children to wear protectivesports gear. Estrogen replacement for women past theage of 50 has been shown to help prevent osteoporosisand the fractures that may result from this condition. Inone study, elderly women on estrogen replacement thera-py demonstrated the lowest occurrence of hip fractureswhen compared to similar women not on estrogenreplacement therapy.

Definition
Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of
inherited mental retardation . Individuals with this con-
dition have developmental delay, variable levels of men-tal retardation, and behavioral and emotional difficulties.They may also have characteristic physical traits. Gener-ally, males are affected with moderate mental retardationand females with mild mental retardation.

"Description
Fragile X syndrome is also known as Martin-Bell syn-
drome, Marker X syndrome, and FRAXA syndrome. It isthe most common form of inherited mental retardation.Fragile X syndrome is caused by a mutation in the FMR-1gene, located on the X chromosome. The role of the gene isunclear, but it is probably important in early development.
In order to understand fragile X syndrome it is"
"important to understand how human genes and chromo-somes influence this condition. Normally, each cell in thebody contains 46 (23 pairs of) chromosomes. Thesechromosomes consist of genetic material (DNA) neededfor the production of proteins, which lead to growth,development, and physical/intellectual characteristics.The first 22 pairs of chromosomes are the same in malesand females. The remaining two chromosomes are calledthe sex chromosomes (X and Y). The sex chromosomesdetermine whether a person is male or female. Maleshave only one X chromosome, which is inherited fromthe mother at conception, and they receive a Y chromo-some from the father. Females inherit two X chromo-somes, one from each parent. Fragile X syndrome iscaused by a mutation in a gene called FMR-1. This geneis located on the X chromosome. The FMR-1 gene isthought to play an important role in the development ofthe brain, but the exact way that the gene acts in the bodyis not fully understood."
"Fragile X syndrome affects males and females of all
ethnic groups. It is estimated that there are about one in4,000 to one in 6,250 males affected with fragile X syn-drome. There are approximately half as many females withfragile X syndrome as there are males. The carrier frequen-cy in unaffected females is one in 100 to one in 600, withone study finding a carrier frequency of one in 250.
Causes and symptoms
For reasons not fully understood, the CGG sequence
in the FMR-1 gene can expand to contain between 54and 230 repeats. This stage of expansion is called a pre-
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1366Fragile X syndrome"
"mutation. People who carry a premutation do not usually
have symptoms of fragile X syndrome; although therehave been reports of individuals with a premutation andsubtle intellectual or behavioral symptoms. Individualswho carry a fragile X premutation are at risk to have chil-dren or grandchildren with the condition. Female premu-tation carriers may also be at increased risk for earlieronset of menopause ; however, premutation carriers may
exist through several generations of a family and nosymptoms of fragile X syndrome will appear.

"The size of the premutation can expand over suc-
ceeding generations. Once the size of the premutationexceeds 230 repeats, it becomes a full mutation and theFMR-1 gene is disabled. Individuals who carry the fullmutation may have fragile X syndrome. Since the FMR-1 gene is located on the X chromosome, males are morelikely to develop symptoms than females. This is becausemales have only one copy of the X chromosome. Maleswho inherit the full mutation are expected to have mentalimpairment. A female’s normal X chromosome maycompensate for her chromosome with the fragile X genemutation. Females who inherit the full mutation have anapproximately 50% risk of mental impairment. The phe-nomenon of an expanding trinucleotide repeat in succes-sive generations is called anticipation.

Any child with signs of developmental delay of
speech, language, or motor development with no knowncause should be considered for fragile X testing, espe-cially if there is a family history of the condition. Behav-ioral and developmental problems may indicate fragile Xsyndrome, particularly if there is a family history ofmental retardation. Definitive identification of the fragileX syndrome is made by means of a genetic test to assessthe number of CGG sequence repeats in the FMR-1gene. Individuals with the premutation or full mutationmay be identified through genetic testing . Genetic test-
ing for the fragile X mutation can be done on the devel-oping baby before birth through amniocentesis or chori-
onic villus sampling (CVS), and is 99% effective indetecting the condition due to trinucleotide repeat expan-"
"sion. Prenatal testing should only be undertaken after thefragile X carrier status of the parents has been confirmedand the couple has been counseled regarding the risks ofrecurrence. While prenatal testing is possible to do withCVS, the results can be difficult to interpret and addition-al testing may be required.

"Treatment
Presently there is no cure for fragile X syndrome.
Management includes such approaches as speech thera-py, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. Theexpertise of psychologists, special education teachers,and genetic counselors may also be beneficial. Drugsmay be used to treat hyperactivity, seizures, and otherproblems. Establishing a regular routine, avoiding overstimulation, and using calming techniques may also helpin the management of behavioral problems. Childrenwith a troubled heart valve may need to see a heart spe-cialist and take medications before surgery or dental pro-cedures. Children with frequent ear and sinus infectionsmay need to take medications or have special tubesplaced in their ears to drain excess fluid. Mainstreamingof children with fragile X syndrome into regular class-rooms is encouraged because they do well imitatingbehavior. Peer tutoring and positive reinforcement arealso encouraged.
Prognosis"
"Prognosis
Early diagnosis and intensive intervention offer the
best prognosis for individuals with fragile X syndrome.Adults with fragile X syndrome may benefit from voca-tional training and may need to live in a supervised set-ting. Life span is typically normal.

"Description
Ataxia is a condition marked by impaired coordina-
tion. Friedreich’s ataxia is the most common inheritedataxia, affecting between 3,000–5,000 people in the Unit-ed States. FA is an autosomal recessive disease, whichmeans that two defective gene copies must be inherited todevelop symptoms, one from each parent. A person withonly one defective gene copy will not show signs of FA,but may pass along the gene to offspring. Couples withone child affected by FA have a 25% chance in eachpregnancy of conceiving another affected child.
Causes and symptoms

The gene for FA codes for a protein called frataxin."
"Causes and symptoms
Causes
The gene for FA codes for a protein called frataxin.
Normal frataxin is found in the cellular energy structuresknown as mitochondria, where it is thought to beinvolved in regulating the transport of iron. In FA, thefrataxin gene on chromosome 9 is expanded with non-sense information known as a “triple repeat.” This extraDNA interferes with normal production of frataxin,thereby impairing iron transport. Normally, there are 10-21 repeats of the frataxin gene. In FA, this sequence maybe repeated between 200-900 times. The types of symp-toms and severity of FA seems to be associated with thenumber of repetitions. Patients with more copies havemore severe symptomatology. Researchers are stillwrestling with how frataxin and the repeats on chromo-some 9 are involved in causing FA. One theory suggeststhat FA develops in part because defects in iron transportprevent efficient use of cellular energy supplies.
The nerve cells most affected by FA are those in the"
"The nerve cells most affected by FA are those in the
spinal cord involved in relaying information betweenmuscles and the brain. Tight control of movementrequires complex feedback between the muscles promot-ing a movement, those restraining it, and the brain. With-out this control, movements become uncoordinated,jerky, and inappropriate to the desired action.
Symptoms
Symptoms of FA usually first appear between the
ages of 8 and 15, although onset as early as 18 months oras late as age 25 is possible. The first symptom is usuallygait incoordination. A child with FA may graze doorwayswhen passing through, for instance, or trip over lowobstacles. Unsteadiness when standing still and deterio-ration of position sense is common. Foot deformities andwalking up off the heels often results from uneven mus-cle weakness in the legs. Muscle spasms and cramps
may occur, especially at night.

"may occur, especially at night.
Ataxia in the arms follows, usually within several
years, leading to decreased hand-eye coordination. Armweakness does not usually occur until much later. Speechand swallowing difficulties are common. Diabetes melli-
tusmay also occur. Nystagmus , or eye tremor, is com-
mon, along with some loss of visual acuity. Hearing loss
may also occur. A side-to-side curvature of the spine ( sco-
liosis ) occurs in many cases, and may become severe.
Heartbeat abnormalities occur in about two thirds of
FA patients, leading to shortness of breath after exer-
tion, swelling in the lower limbs, and frequent com-plaints of cold feet.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of FA involves a careful medical history
and thorough neurological exam. Lab tests include elec-
tromyography , an electrical test of muscle, and a nerve
conduction velocity test. An electrocardiogram may beperformed to diagnose heart arrhythmia.

"Direct DNA testing is available, allowing FA to be
more easily distinguished from other types of ataxia. Thesame test may be used to determine the presence of thegenetic defect in unaffected individuals, such as siblings.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1369Friedreich’s ataxia"
"Treatment
There is no cure for FA, nor any treatment that can
slow its progress. Amantadine may provide some limitedimprovement in ataxic symptoms, but is not recommendedin patients with cardiac abnormalities. Physical and occupa-tional therapy are used to maintain range of motion in weak-ened muscles, and to design adaptive techniques anddevices to compensate for loss of coordination and strength.Some patients find that using weights on the arms can helpdampen the worst of the uncoordinated arm movements.
Heart arrhythmias and diabetes are treated with
drugs specific to those conditions.
Prognosis
The rate of progression of FA is highly variable. Most
patients lose the ability to walk within 15 years of symp-tom onset, and 95% require a wheelchair for mobility byage 45. Reduction in lifespan from FA complications isalso quite variable. Average age at death is in the mid-thir-"
"ties, but may be as late as the mid-sixties. As of mid-1998,the particular length of the triple repeat has not been corre-lated strongly enough with disease progression to allowprediction of the course of the disease on this basis.
Prevention
There is no way to prevent development of FA in a
person carrying two defective gene copies.

Definition
Frostbite is the term for damage to the skin and other
tissues caused by freezing. Frostnip is a mild form ofcold injury.
Description
In North America, frostbite is largely confined to
Alaska, Canada, and the northern states. Recent yearshave witnessed a substantial decline in the number ofcases, probably for several reasons, including better win-ter clothing and footwear and greater public understand-ing of how to avoid cold-weather dangers. At the sametime, the nature of the at-risk population has changed asrising numbers of homeless people have made frostbitean urban as well as a rural public health concern. Thegrowing popularity of outdoor winter activities has alsoexpanded the at-risk population.

"Causes and symptoms
Frostbite
Skin exposed to temperatures a little below the
freezing mark can take hours to freeze, but very cold skincan freeze in minutes or seconds. Air temperature, windspeed, and moisture all affect how cold the skin becomes.A strong wind can lower skin temperature considerablyby dispersing the thin protective layer of warm air thatsurrounds our bodies. Wet clothing readily draws heataway from the skin because water is a potent conductorof heat. The evaporation of moisture on the skin also pro-duces cooling. For these reasons, wet skin or clothing ona windy day can lead to frostbite even if the air tempera-ture is above the freezing mark.
The extent of permanent injury, however, is deter-
mined not by how cold the skin and the underlying tis-sues become but by how long they remain frozen. Conse-quently, homeless people and others whose self-preser-vation instincts may be clouded by alcohol or psychiatricillness face a greater risk of frostbite-related amputation"
"because they are more likely to stay out in the cold whenprudence dictates seeking shelter or medical attention.Alcohol also affects blood circulation in the extremitiesin a way that can increase the severity of injury (as doessmoking ). A review of 125 Saskatchewan frostbite cases
found a tie to alcohol in 46% and to psychiatric illness in17%. Other risk factors identified by researchers includeinadequate clothing, previous cold injury, fatigue ,
wound infection, atherosclerosis (an arterial disease),
and diabetes. Driving in poor weather can also be dan-

"15% of the Saskatchewan cases.
Three nearly simultaneous physiological processes
underlie frostbite injury: tissue freezing, tissue hypoxia, andthe release of inflammatory mediators. Tissue freezingcauses ice crystal formation and other changes that damageand eventually kill cells. Much of this harm occurs becausethe ice produces pressure changes that cause water (crucialfor cell survival) to flow out of the cells. Tissue hypoxia(oxygen deficiency) occurs when the blood vessels in thehands, feet, and other extremities narrow in response tocold. Among its many tasks, blood transfers body heat to theskin, which then dissipates the heat into the environment.Blood vessel narrowing is the body’s way of protecting vitalinternal organs at the expense of the extremities by reducingheat flow away from the core. However, blood also carrieslife-sustaining oxygen to the skin and other tissues, and nar-rowed vessels result in oxygen starvation . Narrowing also"
"causes acidosis (an increase in tissue acidity) and increasesblood viscosity (thickness). Ultimately, blood stops flowingthrough the capillaries (the tiny blood vessels that connectthe arteries and veins) and blood clots form in the arteriolesand venules (the smallest arteries and veins). Damage alsooccurs to the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels.Hypoxia, blood clots, and endothelial damage lead, in turn,to the release of inflammatory mediators (substances thatact as links in the inflammatory process), which promotefurther endothelial damage, hypoxia, and cell destruction.
Frostbite is classified by degree of injury (first, sec-"
"Frostbite is classified by degree of injury (first, sec-
ond, third, or fourth), or simply divided into two types,superficial (corresponding to first- or second-degreeinjury) and deep (corresponding to third- or fourth-degreeinjury). Most frostbite injuries affect the feet or hands. Theremaining 10% of cases typically involve the ears, nose,cheeks, or penis. Once frostbite sets in, the affected partbegins to feel cold and, usually, numb; this is followed bya feeling of clumsiness. The skin turns white or yellowish.Many patients experience severe pain in the affected part
during rewarming treatment and an intense throbbing painthat arises two or three days later and can last days orweeks. As the skin begins to thaw during treatment,edema (excess tissue fluid) often accumulates, causing"
"swelling. In second- and higher-degree frostbite, blistersappear. Third-degree cases produce deep, blood-filled blis-ters and, during the second week, a hard black eschar(scab). Fourth-degree frostbite penetrates below the skin tothe muscles, tendons, nerves, and bones. In severe cases offrostbite the dead tissue can mummify and drop off. Infec-tion is also a possibility.
Frostnip
Like frostbite, frostnip is associated with ice crystal
formation in the tissues, but no tissue destruction occurs andthe crystals dissolve as soon as the skin is warmed. Frostnip
affects areas such as the earlobes, cheeks, nose, fingers, andtoes. The skin turns pale and one experiences numbness ortingling in the affected part until warming begins.
Diagnosis
Frostbite diagnosis relies on a physical examina-
tion and may also include conventional radiography (x
rays), angiography (x-ray examination of the blood ves-"
"rays), angiography (x-ray examination of the blood ves-
sels using an injected dye to provide contrast), thermog-raphy (use of a heat-sensitive device for measuring bloodflow), and other techniques for predicting the course ofinjury and identifying tissue that requires surgicalremoval. During the initial treatment period, however, aphysician cannot judge how a case will progress. Diag-nostic tests only become useful three to five days afterrewarming, once the blood vessels have stabilized.

"Treatment
Frostbite
Emergency medical help should always be sum-
moned whenever frostbite is suspected. While waiting forhelp to arrive, one should, if possible, remove wet or tightclothing and put on dry, loose clothing or wraps. A splintand padding are used to protect the injured area. Rubbingthe area with snow or anything else is dangerous. The keyto prehospital treatment is to avoid partial thawing andrefreezing, which releases more inflammatory mediatorsand makes the injury substantially worse. For this reason,the affected part must be kept away from heat sources suchas campfires and car heaters. Experts advise rewarming inthe field only when emergency help will take more thantwo hours to arrive and refreezing can be prevented.
Because the outcome of a frostbite injury cannot be
predicted at first, all hospital treatment follows the same

"route. Treatment begins by rewarming the affected part
for 15–30 minutes in water at a temperature of104–108°F (40–42.2°C). This rapid rewarming halts icecrystal formation and dilates narrowed blood vessels.Aloe vera (which acts against inflammatory mediators) isapplied to the affected part, which is then splinted, ele-vated, and wrapped in a dressing. Depending on theextent of injury, blisters may be debrided (cleaned byremoving foreign material) or simply covered with aloevera. A tetanus shot and, possibly, penicillin, are used to
prevent infection, and the patient is given ibuprofen tocombat inflammation. Narcotics are needed in mostcases to reduce the excruciating pain that occurs as sen-sation returns during rewarming. Except when injury isminimal, treatment generally requires a hospital stay ofseveral days, during which hydrotherapy and physical"
"therapy are used to restore the affected part to health.Experts recommend a cautious approach to tissueremoval, and advise that 22–45 days must pass before adecision on amputation can safely be made.

on them or holding them under one’s armpits. Otherfrostnipped areas can be covered with warm hands. Theinjured areas should never be rubbed.

"Alternative treatment
Alternative practitioners suggest several kinds of
treatment to speed recovery from frostbite after leaving thehospital. Bathing the affected part in warm water or usingcontrast hydrotherapy can help enhance circulation. Con-trast hydrotherapy involves a series of hot and cold waterapplications. A hot compress (as hot as the patient canstand) is applied to the affected area for three minutes fol-lowed by an ice cold compress for 30 seconds. Theseapplications are repeated three times each, ending with thecold compress. Nutritional therapy to promote tissuegrowth in damaged areas may also be helpful. Homeo-pathic and botanical therapies may also assist recoveryfrom frostbite. Homeopathic Hypericum (Hypericum per-
foratum ) is recommended when nerve ending are affected
(especially in the fingers and toes) and Arnica (Arnica
montana ) is prescribed for shock . Cayenne pepper ( Cap-
sicum frutescens ) can enhance circulation and relieve pain."
"sicum frutescens ) can enhance circulation and relieve pain.
Drinking hot ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) tea also aids cir-
culation. Other possible approaches include acupuncture
to avoid permanent nerve damage and oxygen therapy.
Prognosis
The rapid rewarming approach to frostbite treatment,
pioneered in the 1980s, has proved to be much moreeffective than older methods in preventing tissue loss and
amputation. A study of 56 first-, second-, and third-degreefrostbite patients treated with rapid rewarming in1982–85 found that 68% recovered without tissue loss,25% experienced some tissue loss, and 7% needed ampu-tation. In a comparison group of 98 patients, treatmentusing older methods resulted in a tissue loss rate of nearly35% and an amputation rate of nearly 33%. Although thecomparison group included a higher proportion of sec-ond- and third-degree cases, the difference in treatmentresults was determined to be statistically significant."
"The extreme throbbing pain that many frostbite suf-
ferers endure for days or weeks after rewarming is notthe only prolonged symptom of frostbite. During the firstweeks or months, people often experience tingling, aburning sensation, or a sensation resembling shocks froman electric current. Other possible consequences of frost-bite include skin—color changes, nail deformation orloss, joint stiffness and pain, hyperhidrosis (excessive
sweating), and heightened sensitivity to cold. For every-one, a degree of sensory loss lasting at least four years—and sometimes a lifetime—is inevitable.

"Prevention
With the appropriate knowledge and precautions,
frostbite can be prevented even in the coldest and mostchallenging environments. Appropriate clothing andfootwear are essential. To prevent heat loss and keep theblood circulating properly, clothing should be wornloosely and in layers. Covering the hands, feet, and headis also crucial for preventing heat loss. Outer garmentsneed to be wind and water resistant, and wet clothing andfootwear must be replaced as quickly as possible. Alco-hol and drugs should be avoided because of their harmfuleffects on judgment and reasoning. Experts also warnagainst alcohol use and smoking in the cold because ofthe circulatory changes they produce. Paying close atten-tion to the weather report before venturing outdoors andavoiding unnecessary risks such as driving in isolatedareas during a blizzard are also important.
